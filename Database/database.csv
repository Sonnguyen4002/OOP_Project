On the 19th of May, AMBCrypto observed that Ethereum’s [ETH] average transaction size had fallen to $2,767. This was a 54.13% decline from the metric when the month began. At that time, the average transaction size was $5,893, according to data from IntoTheBlock. For the uninitiated, the average transaction size checks in dollar terms the mean transaction value for an asset on a particular day.  Historically, spikes in this metric signal high user activity—Especially from large investors and institutions. But when it decreases, it implies an absence of institutional interaction. As such, the recent state of Ethereum implies a presence of more retail users. Apart from that, this indicator identifies potential tops and bottoms. From the value mentioned, it was obvious that ETH seemed closer to its bottom than the top. At press time, ETH’s price was $3,106, indicating that it had swung around the same range in the last 24 hours. Source: IntoTheBlock Going by the analysis above, the price of the cryptocurrency could be set to hit a higher value in the short term. However, other metrics need to be considered. As a result of this, AMBCrypto looked at the Ethereum Exchange Net Position Change. According to data obtained from Glassnode, the Exchange Net Position Change has been in the negative region for most of the last 30 days. This metric tracks the 30-day change of the supply held in exchange wallets. A positive value indicates that more coins are in exchanges. On the other hand, a negative value indicates increased withdrawals from exchanges. One thing we noticed was that the metric suddenly became positive on the 18th of May. As of this writing, the ETH net position change was 81,715. This increase could be a sign that Ethereum participants are taking profits off the 6.50% increase within the last week. If this number continues to increase, then ETH’s price might decrease below $3,000 before the potential rally happens. Source: Santiment However, if exchange withdrawals intensify once more, the price might begin a slow increase toward $3,500. In a highly bullish situation, an increase to $4,000 could be an option. On Friday, the 17th of May, AMBCrypto reported how options traders were expecting ETH’s price to hit $3,600 between May and the end of June. At press time, Glassnode data showed that the sentiment had not changed. This is because of the signals from the Put/Call Ratio (PCR). Is your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator If the PCR is over 0.70, it implies a bearish sentiment and there are more puts than calls. However, a reading below 0.50 implies otherwise. At press time, Ethereum’s Put/Call Ratio was 0.35, meaning that most traders expect the value of the cryptocurrency to increase in the coming weeks.

If any of these key institutions were to go bankrupt, they would likely take sizable market chunks down with them. This guide explores some of the most impactful crypto bankruptcies, which have changed how the industry considers compliance, security standards, risk management, and the associated economic consequences. Over the years, numerous failed crypto projects have led to eventual crypto bankruptcies. While we shall discuss a number of these in detail, here’s a quick summary of some of the key events. In 2014, the Mt.Gox bankruptcy was led by a host of security breaches and resulted in a loss of 850,000 BTC. Then, there was the QuadrigaCX bankruptcy, which resulted in sizable investor losses due to financial mismanagement and lack of proper risk management strategies. Perhaps the most well-known crypto bankruptcy, however, was the FTX collapse in late 2022, led by the now-convicted Sam Bankman Fried. Companies in #crypto that have gone bankrupt Three Arrows Capital Celsius Network Terraform Labs Voyager Digital Core Scientific Babel Finance Hodlnaut Genesis BlockFI Zipmex FTX Blockchain Global And these are only a handful of failed crypto projects. Read on as we thoroughly explore the notable crypto bankruptcies, with the most recent events explained first. Did you know? Investigative sleuthers and handles like CoffeeZilla can help you track the status of both new and established crypto projects. This can help you navigate the space better and stay informed about possible scams, rug pulls, and other crypto bankruptcies. Genesis Global, a popular crypto trading and lending firm, imploded due to the severe liquidity crisis. Let us delve deeper into the aspects that impacted the positioning of this Digital Currency Group subsidiary. Genesis Global was overexposed to several less-than-transparent firms, including FTX and Three Arrows Capital. So when those institutions imploded, the entire machinery of Genesis Global felt the ripple effect. Genesis Global even kickstarted the Barry Silbert-led DCG group’s downfall as the extensive lending operations backfired. Here’s how on-chain metrics could have saved investors: Before Genesis Global filed for bankruptcy protection, the Genesis Trading OTC address transferred: – 50,000 $ETH($77.6M) #Coinbase; – 20,000 $ETH($31M) to #Bitstamp; – 5,000 $ETH($7.76M) and 3.9M $USDT to #Kraken; – 7.7M $FTM ($2.35M) to #Binance; – 36M $USDC to new address. pic.twitter.com/cMMKpLdVJs Eventually, the company filed for Chapter 11 (bankruptcy protection), listing liabilities to the tune of $11 billion. Over 100,000 creditors, per the company details, were impacted. The bankruptcy proceedings are ongoing, and a number of investors are still waiting to receive any compensation. In terms of recovery plans and asset sales, Genesis intends to sell shares to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and other establishments to raise approximately $1.6 billion. The FTX crisis was the primary bear market event, where most cryptocurrencies bottomed out. As we know, Solana (SOL) was one of the majorly impacted cryptocurrencies. Uncle Sam Bankman Fried. FTX balance sheet is like US bank balance sheets. Assets valued on what they were bought for, not what they can be sold for. “FTX is fine” is like the assurance that “the US financial system is resilient”. We don’t hear this except when it’s not fine. https://t.co/FRXHwSv8QJ pic.twitter.com/kEKAw6j08v FTX was one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. However, in November 2022, a series of investigative insights highlighted that this firm was working too closely with sister firm Alameda Research, also founded by Bankman-Fried. Customer deposits on FTX were being misused to cover Alameda’s losses. As the news broke, FTX experienced a bank run with many users trying to withdraw funds at the same time. As the exchange couldn’t meet the massive bankruptcy requests, it was forced to file for bankruptcy on Nov. 11, 2022. FTX and the concerned affiliates reported having assets and liabilities in the $10 billion to $50 billion range. Following the meltdown, a new CEO, John Jay Ray III, was appointed to navigate and oversee the restructuring process. Andrew Dietderich, an FTX Lawyer, stated in January 2024 that FTX creditors and customers will be paid in full. This process is still in the works. At present, the now-defunct organization plans to distribute $9 billion to cover some compensation claims. BlockFi, a leading crypto lending firm, was impacted by the financial distress experienced by FTX. It is known that BlockFi extended a $400 million credit line to FTX in addition to several direct investments. Crypto failures are interconnected: A judge is still yet to sign off on a settlement that will see BlockFi receive $874.5 million in claims against FTX and Alameda Research, while FTX will drop its claims against BlockFi. https://t.co/YQiIhqzd5V When FTX experienced a liquidity crisis, the perils of financial mismanagement rubbed onto BlockFi. The company had exposure to FTX and Alameda Research, which ensured that most of the assets were unrecoverable after the FTX collapse. While filing for bankruptcy, BlockFi reported assets and liabilities in the $1 billion to $10 billion range. These included $355 million worth of locked cryptocurrency on FTX and a defaulted loan worth $671 million to Alameda. The recovery efforts associated with BlockFi are ongoing. There has been a judicial decision concerning a repayment of $300 million to the creditors. Recovery percentages vary anywhere between 39% and 100%. This Singapore-based crypto hedge fund shut shop in June 2022. Here is what went down and how the market was impacted. The fund had heavy exposure to volatile crypto strategies and assets. Plus, there was significant leverage involved. Also, when the TerraUSD debacle led to LUNA’s death spiral and a major correction across multiple cryptocurrencies, the liquidity crisis for 3AC became harder to manage. The fund couldn’t meet margin calls associated with its leveraged positions and went bankrupt. OPNX, the crypto exchange and claims trading platform set up by the founders of Three Arrows Capital, will cease operations and shut down this month. @tikta_ reportshttps://t.co/QUAqcw6mpk 3AC filed for Chapter 15, securing assets from U.S. creditors amid liquidations. The total creditor claims reached as high as $3.5 billion, whereas the estimated assets, as of July 2023, stood at $1 billion. While the bankruptcy proceedings are ongoing, it is believed that 46% of the credit claims could be responded to. Celcius was a leading firm in the staking and lending space. The company declared bankruptcy in July 2022. The collapse of the Terra-Luna ecosystem was one of the major reasons that Celsius was forced to file for Chapter 11. The company was over-leveraged, made a series of poor investment decisions, and was pushed to the brink by a rapid withdrawal of funds by nervous investors. The recovery efforts seem to have concluded, and in January 2024, the company distributed assets worth $3 billion to creditors. Plus, the company has also revealed its plans to establish a Bitcoin mining entity to generate compensatory revenue further. So I finally got my distribution yesterday in the @CelsiusNetwork #Bankruptcy case. What's crazy (aside from how long it took & still no word on the shares) is that I'm getting some seriously convincing #phishing emails. The phishing emails are ones that are specifically related… pic.twitter.com/1OJfpEqGAH Voyager, a brokerage and lending firm, entered bankruptcy proceedings in July 2022. Voyager’s implosion followed the TerraUSD crash. As 3AC went down, it defaulted on a large credit line extended to 3AC, which caused unrest and negatively impacted Voyager’s health. At the time of filing — July 2022— Voyager reported liabilities worth $5.7 billion. Voyager initially planned to sell its assets to FTX U.S. for $1.4 billion, a move that would have helped creditors recover almost 72% of the claims. However, before this could happen, FTX collapsed, too, leaving the deal to fall through. As of 2024, the company has managed to return funds worth $270 million to the clients, and it even entered a deal worth $1 billion with Binance U.S. 1/ As soon as the news that #BinanceUS was preparing to bid for the bankrupt lending platform Voyager Digital came out, the price of $VGX rose from $0.288 to $0.442, an increase of 53.5%.https://t.co/6VLPn2t9zH pic.twitter.com/fBG33te8rP This means Voyager customers could potentially expect 35.72% of their claims to get addressed. The collapse of the Terra ecosystem didn’t only impact the U.S-based firms. The ripples were felt globally. Hodlnaut, a Singapore-specific lending platform, was also forced to shut shop following these events. The company faced severe liquidity issues and halted swaps, withdrawals, and even deposits in August 2022. It had allowed users to borrow against crypto deposits, a use-case that eventually made it vulnerable. When the market began correcting, the value of Hodlnaut’s collateral started dipping, leading to a massive liquidity shortfall. The company is going through a restructuring phase led by judicial inputs. This Southeast Asia-based cryptocurrency exchange catered to Thailand, Indonesia, Australia, and Singapore before going bust in 2022. The financial distress surrounding Zipmex amplified when two of its biggest borrowers, Celsius Network and Babel Finance, started facing a liquidity crisis. The loans were defaulted, exposing Zipmex’s erroneous financial stance. Marcus Lim, CEO and co-founder of Zipmex, denied that the firm was facing insolvency issues just days prior. https://t.co/fr2eI2Wc8X The company is still involved in a restructuring process presided over by the Singapore court. During the bankruptcy filing, Babel Finance and Celsius owed $48 million and $5 million to Zipmex, respectively. It isn’t only about lending firms or exchanges impacted by bankruptcies. Core Scientific, one of the largest Bitcoin miners in North America, filed for Chapter 11 in December 2022. An extended bear market followed by rising energy costs, increased mining difficulty, and piled-up debts were some of the reasons that Core Scientific had to shut shop. As of 2024, Core Scientific has emerged from the bankruptcy hit, mining 19,274 BTC in 2023 alone. Its post-bankruptcy reorganization process is complete, and it is also currently trading on NASDAQ (as of April 23, 2024) at close to $3 per share. Today @Core_Scientific have released their production for the last 24 hours and it appears they have taken full advantage of the transaction fees spike since the halving, producing a total of 57.3 #BTC equating to $3.72 million in revenues. 🚀 Hashprice revenues increased from… pic.twitter.com/XMA5xF5DDI Even mining firms need to diversify business operations and revenue streams to mitigate the threats of market volatility. It is worth noting that most of the crypto bankruptcies in 2022 were interconnected, exposing the over-reliance of key players on major liquidity providers and creditors. Even though 2022 and even 2023 saw the most impactful cryptocurrency bankruptcies, such events really started back in 2014 with the Mt.Gox bankruptcy. Since then, several crypto bankruptcies have surfaced, every now and then, led by security breaches, financial mismanagement, exit scams, and others. Here’s some insight into some other key events. This Australian crypto firm declared voluntary administration or bankruptcy in November 2021, led by a culminating debt that exceeded $15 million. Plus, one of its subsidiaries, the Australian Crypto Exchange or ACX, also halted its operations at that time, putting additional pressure on Blockchain Global. ACX, an Australian crypto exchange, declared bankruptcy in February 2020. The company ceased its exchange abruptly. Investor losses worth $10 million were recorded, which in turn forced the Victoria Supreme Court to issue a freeze order on ACX’s BTC holdings. This Singapore-based exchange declared bankruptcy in February 2020. Its controversial transaction mining business model fueled concerns of unsustainable cash flows. Accusations involving financial mismanagement and concerns related to exit scams and related frauds sealed the deal. This U.S-based crypto lending platform filed for Chapter 11 in 2020, driven by fraudulent activities, mismanagement, and poor investment choices. Cred gave out high-interest loans to moKredit and other third-party entities, expecting high profits — a move that backfired. Plus, a fraudulent asset manager was accused of misappropriating 800 Bitcoins via an entity called Quanticon. https://t.co/Xq2VseEfV5 Cred had a license to print money, and a blockchain ecosystem to do it on – and now they are filing Chapter 11 Bankruptcy driven by terrible risk controls. Looks like they over leveraged internal positions and had external loans go sour. Did you know? James Alexander was named as the fraudulent asset manager who was implicated in the 800-BTC fund misappropriation fiasco. This New Zealand-specific exchange was breached in 2019, with hackers managing access to the user wallets. The hack led to huge financial losses and forced Cryptopia to shut down operations and liquidate. QuadrigaCX was one of the largest Candian exchanges, which went bust after the unexpected death of Gerald Cotten, its CEO. Cotten, supposedly, was the only person with access to the firm’s cold wallets, and his death ensured a loss of almost $190 million in customer funds. Some folks still consider it one of the better-devised exit scams. 🚨LATEST: Canadian Province Asks QuadrigaCX Co-Founder to Explain His Wealth in New Order The Bitconnect bankruptcy or shutdown was essentially a disguised Ponzi scheme. The platform was aggressive in offering a 40% return to users, primarily by reinvesting user funds. However, the regulatory crackdown stunted its operations, leading to investor losses to the tune of $1 billion. Mt.Gox was once the largest Bitcoin exchange. In 2014, it experienced a massive security breach worth 850,000 BTC, led by poor management, technological flaws, and security lapses. Investors indulged in extended legal battles until 2021, when the rehabilitation plan for the distribution of assets was approved. MtGox Creditors Receive Update on Token Withdrawal 🚨🚨#MtGox has updated the official website form, providing details on expected tokens and payment statuses for creditors. The distribution of 142,000 #BTC, 143,000 BCH, and 69 billion yen is anticipated by October 31, 2024. Besides the mentioned cryptocurrency bankruptcies, there were a handful of other scams that impacted the associated companies beyond measure. Here are the notable ones: In 2016, Bitfinex, one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges, was hacked. Almost 120,000 Bitcoins were compromised, accounting for a massive loss figure of up to $72 million at the time. Even though they managed to avoid bankruptcy, a controversial strategy of introducing BFX tokens to make customers whole was introduced. It is worth noting that platforms launching tokens just for the sake of covering losses or raising capital isn’t a good practice. It can also be a major scam-specific red flag. The DAO, a venture capital body backing Ethereum, faced a smart contract hack in 2016. Almost $50 million worth of funds were compromised, which didn’t lead to bankruptcy but caused a split across the Ethereum community — a fork separating Ethereum Classic and Ethereum. This anomaly in 2017 started as a multi-sign vulnerability specific to the Parity wallet. However, it quickly escalated into a $280 million ETH freeze. This issue highlighted the risks associated with smart contract bugs. 2017 Parity wallet hacker begins moving $ETH into @TornadoCash#PeckShieldAlert ~990 $ETH into @TornadoCash from Parity Multisig Wallet Exploiters. pic.twitter.com/VESvN0XL9F This Japan-based exchange suffered a huge security breach in January 2018. Hackers stole NEM or XEM tokens worth $534 million from the exchange’s hot wallet, resulting in reputational and financial damage. The company eventually compensated investors using its own capital. Babel Finance had to go through a restructuring process in 2022 as it faced liquidity issues and had to halt withdrawals. Customer funds worth $280 million were compromised, citing that Babel sought bankruptcy protection in 2022. However, the court granted them an extension and time to restabilize and restructure. While everything looks well with Binance operationally, the largest crypto exchange has faced its share of issues. The CEX was ordered to pay $4.3 billion as part of a settlement with the Department of Justice. Plus, it continues to be at the center of endless regulatory scrutiny. While the exchange has been limited in a number of locations across the globe, the CEX has ramped up compliance efforts to the extent that it will resume operations in India in 2024. Good news for Crypto India! 🇮🇳#Binance is coming back to India, paying a $2 million penalty, and seeking compliance with PMLA! pic.twitter.com/iivm4oySP4 While investors do not have any control over crypto bankruptcies, there are a number of precautions that can be taken. Ensure to invest time in due diligence, opt for portfolio diversification, rely on cold wallets, and only interact with regulated platforms. As always, never invest more than you can comfortably afford to lose. The FTX collapse was one of the largest cryptocurrency bankruptcies. It happened due to misuse of customer funds and financial mismanagement. FTX used billion of dollars to cover losses at Alameda Research, leading to a liquidity crisis and eventually pushing the firm to the brink of bankruptcy proceedings. While there is no concrete list, many crypto companies have failed over the years, led by regulatory challenges, security breachesm, market volatility, and the team members pulling exit scams. The notable ones include the QuadrigaCX bankruptcy, the Cryptopia bankruptcy, BitConnect bankruptcy, and the Mt.Gox bankruptcy. Each instance highlights crucial lessons from crypto failures and the importance of regulatory compliance and risk management across the crypto industry. The recovery efforts following the FTX bankruptcy are ongoing. The now-defunct exchange has been able to recover over $7 billion to repay customers. The proceedings and repayment plans are being looked at by the bankruptcy court to streamline the process. Yes, individuals associated with the BitConnect scam had to bear legal consequences. For instance, Glenn Arcaro, one of the top BitConnect promoters, pleaded guilty to wire fraud and conspiracy and was enetually imprisoned. The BitConnect scam was around $2.4 billion and can be termed as one of the more infamous crypto exit scams. The platform promised high returns via a proprietary trading algorithm but went belly up, leaving behind significant investor losses.

The bill will go into effect on November 1, 2024. OKHB3594 was signed into law by Governor Kevin Stitt. It was sponsored by four Republicans — State Senators Bill Coleman and Dana Prieto and State Representatives Brian Hill and Cody Maynard. Under the bill, Oklahoma bans restricting or outlawing the use “or the self-custody of digital assets using a self-hosted wallet or a hardware wallet,” a page for the bill said. Oklahomans can also mine crypto both at home and industrially, though they have to comply with local noise ordinances.

Additionally, “discriminatory electricity rates for digital asset mining businesses are outlawed as well.” Residents can use crypto to pay for goods and services and are protected from paying additional taxes. “Digital assets used as a method of payment may not be subject to any additional tax, withholding, assessment or charge by the state or local government that is based solely on the use of the digital asset as the method of payment,” the bill continued.

One of the key benefits for those new to trading is the provision of a demo account, enabling them to familiarize themselves with the interface and hone their trading strategies without jeopardizing their funds. If you don’t have a Binance account. You can register here The trading simulator, also known as a demo account, on this cryptocurrency exchange, serves as a risk-free virtual account aimed at educating users and helping them develop their trading skills. It offers beginners a safe environment to navigate through the platform’s features, experiment with different strategies, and refine their trading abilities. Binance provides access to this simulator specifically for futures trading through the Binance Testnet. The emphasis on derivatives rather than spot trading stems from the heightened risks associated with futures trading. Furthermore, navigating through the Futures section on Binance can be complex, increasing the likelihood of beginners making inadvertent errors while initiating positions. Given the similarities between futures and spot orders, utilizing the trading simulator for Futures enables Binance users to also grasp the fundamentals of the interface used across various trading modalities. Therefore, it is recommended for novices to commence their journey in cryptocurrency trading and get acquainted with the exchange starting with a demo account. A test trading demo account is indispensable for individuals new to the world of trading. When used effectively, it can significantly minimize the risks of deposit losses due to a lack of experience and technical blunders. Nevertheless, similar to any instrument, a trading simulator has its set of pros and cons. However, it’s critical not to treat the demo account as a perfect substitute for a real trading terminal. It has several downsides that hinder the replication of an authentic trading experience with a real deposit: In sum, while the Binance Testnet trading simulator is a valuable resource for educational purposes, it lacks the capacity to completely mirror the intricacies and conditions of real trading, and it does not impose the emotional burdens—such as stress and pressure—that traders face when putting their own money on the line. The experience is incomparable to trading on a simulator. If your goal is to comprehensively understand the trading interface of the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, your best option is to utilize a demo account on the Binance Testnet. It’s accessible in the futures trading section, allowing you to experiment with Binance futures trading without putting your deposit at risk. However, it is imperative to recognize that the trading simulator is not a full substitute for a real trading terminal. A demo account can’t precisely mimic unpredictable market conditions and does not provide the trader with the level of involvement and emotional experience that comes with trading real money.

DCG objected to the distribution plan as it believes repayments should be capped at the crypto asset values of January 2023 (at the time of Genesis’ bankruptcy filing). Since then, the value of cryptos like Bitcoin has surged, with Bitcoin’s price jumping from around $21,000 to a current value of nearly $67,000. The firm also claimed that the plan provides too much return to creditors at DCG’s expense. Essentially, DCG feels that it is unfairly disadvantaged by how the returns are allocated. However, DCG’s arguments failed. Judge Sean Lane ruled that, as an equity holder, DCG’s financial interest isn’t directly impacted by how the assets are distributed. Equity holders only get paid after all creditors are satisfied. Additionally, given the insolvency and the massive creditor claims, DCG won’t receive any distribution under this plan. The total amount owed to creditors is billions of dollars higher than the debtors’ available assets. These claims have priority over equity holders like DCG, meaning they get paid first in line during bankruptcy. The ruling also considered the substantial $32 billion in claims from federal and state financial regulators, prioritizing them over DCG’s equity stake. Genesis had previously estimated that it could pay up to 77% of the value of customer claims, a figure subject to future market fluctuations. Hit hard by the collapse of Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and FTX, Genesis – along with other lending platforms – faced liquidity issues during the 2022 market downturn. This ultimately led the company to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January 2023. Genesis’ creditors include several prominent names, such as Gemini, Bybit’s Mirama, Decentraland, and VanEck. Adding to its troubles, Genesis Global Capital faced a legal lawsuit from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC accused Genesis and Gemini of selling unregistered securities through Gemini Earn. The company reached a $21 million settlement with the SEC in March this year.

6::https://theconversation.com/bitcoin-is-halving-again-what-does-that-mean-for-the-cryptocurrency-and-the-market-228213::The Conversation::article::Bitcoin is halving again – what does that mean for the cryptocurrency and the market?::There are reasons to believe that the bitcoin halving could keep the value of the currency high.::Bitcoin, the largest and most talked about digital asset, has been on a rollercoaster of a ride since its launch in January 2009. With a market capitalisation that reached a high of more than US$1.4 trillion (£1.125 trillion) this February and volatile swings since, bitcoin has attracted lots of attention recently. Now a hotly anticipated recurring event that happens roughly every four years is taking place: the bitcoin halving. This could have further significant impact on the value of the cryptocurrency. You can listen to more articles from The Conversation, narrated by Noa. To understand what the halving is and what it could mean, we have to understand how bitcoin works. Bitcoin is a digital currency that makes use of what’s called blockchain technology to securely store, record and publicly publish all transactions. It is distinct from fiat currencies, such as dollars or pounds, because it has no central authority and members of the network have equal power. Each transaction is made and recorded with the user’s public address, a code that enables them to remain anonymous. Bitcoins are created by so-called miners who contribute computing power to secure the network and solve complex mathematical puzzles in order to process transaction data. These miners are then rewarded for their work with newly minted bitcoins. The idea for bitcoin was first proposed in a white paper published online in 2008 by a mysterious individual or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. To combat inflation, Nakamoto wrote into the code that the total number of bitcoins will only ever be 21 million. Currently, more than 19.6 million bitcoins have been mined. At the beginning, back in 2009, miners received 50 bitcoins for every block (unit of transaction data) they mined. But after every 210,000 blocks (roughly every four years), the reward halves. So in 2012 the reward fell to 25 bitcoins, then to 12.5 bitcoins in 2016 and to 6.25 bitcoins in 2020. The latest halving means the reward will be just 3.125 bitcoins. Nakamoto has never explained explicitly the reasons behind the halving. Some speculate that the halving system was designed to distribute coins more quickly at the beginning to incentivise people to join the network and mine new blocks. Block rewards are programmed to halve at regular intervals because the value of each coin rewarded is deemed likely to increase as the network expands. But this may lead to users holding bitcoin as a speculative asset rather than using it as a medium of exchange. Additionally, the 21 million cap on the number of coins that can enter circulation makes them scarce (at least in comparison to dollars or euros), which for some people is enough to make them valuable. So what impact does the halving have on the price? After the halving, the number of new bitcoin entering circulation shrinks. Demand should, in theory, be unaffected by this event and therefore the price should go up. “The theory is that there will be less bitcoin available to buy if miners have less to sell,” said Michael Dubrovsky, a co-founder of PoWx, a crypto research non-profit. While the first halving happened in 2012, when bitcoin was less well known and quite hard to buy and sell, we can learn from the subsequent two halvings. The second halving on July 16 2016 was highly anticipated. The price dropped by 10%, but then shot back up to where it had been before. Although the immediate impact on the price was small, bitcoin did eventually respond and some argue that the 2017 bull run when the market boomed was a delayed result of the halving. Beginning the year around US$900, by the end of 2017 bitcoin was trading above US$19,000. The third halving in 2020 happened during a bullish period for bitcoin and it continued to rise to more than US$56,000 in 2021. These few data points are not enough however to offer any concrete causal relationship or trend. But we do know that instantly miners’ rewards are halved, meaning their revenue immediately halves and their profit margins are severely affected. Consequently, unless there is a price appreciation, many miners may become unprofitable and could cease the practice. Bitcoin’s scarcity is arguably one of its most significant characteristics, especially in a time of high inflation, quantitative easing and high interest rates. With the real value of fiat currencies falling, bitcoin’s limited supply is an attractive feature and can be reassuring for investors. Bitcoin hit an all-time high in February following the approval of bitcoin exchange-traded funds, which effectively make it easier for retail investors and big banks to invest in bitcoin. This, coupled with a more favourable regulatory environment on the horizon and the fact that it is becoming more integrated in the financial system, means bitcoin may continue on the rise it has experienced in 2024 so far.::2024-04-19T15:10:52Z::Audio narrated, Bitcoin, Blockchain, Crypto, Investing::Andrew Urquhart::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/588990/original/file-20240418-20-prjfv3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=808%2C1266%2C5110%2C2550&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

The SEC accused Terraform Labs and Kwon of misleading investors about the stability of its so-called “algorithmic” native stablecoin, Terra USD (UST), and the use cases for the Terra blockchain. The jury delivered the verdict on Friday, just two hours after lawyers for both the SEC and the defendants gave their closing arguments at the end of the nine-day trial in New York. Jurors agreed with the SEC that Kwon and, under his direction, Terraform Labs deceived everyday investors about the nature of the supposed algorithm that kept UST pegged to the U.S. dollar. Though Kwon insinuated that it could “automatically self-heal” in the event of a de-peg, it actually relied on continuous trading activity, including large-scale trading done by institutional investors. “We are pleased with today’s jury verdict holding Terraform Labs and Do Kwon liable for a massive crypto fraud,” Gurbir Grewal, SEC Division of Enforcement director, wrote in a statement. “The defendants caused devastating losses for investors and wiped out tens of billions of market value nearly overnight. For all of crypto’s promises, the lack of registration and compliance have very real consequences for real people. As the hard work of our team shows, we will continue to use the tools at our disposal to protect the investing public, but it is high time for the crypto markets to come into compliance,” Grewal added. SEC attorney Laura Meehan told the jury during her closing arguments on Friday that one of those institutional investors – Jump Trading – had made a secret deal with Kwon and Terraform Labs to rescue UST during a de-pegging event in May 2021, stepping in and buying millions of dollars of UST off-chain to reinflate its value and bring it back to parity with the dollar. Meehan added that, after Jump’s intervention, Kwon and his company intentionally kept the firm’s rescue mission quiet, wanting instead to use the re-pegging as evidence of the algorithm’s effectiveness. Lawyers for Terraform Labs and Kwon attempted to wave Jump’s involvement away as a regular part of their relationship with Terraform Labs as a market maker. They said that all “reasonable” investors knew that the algorithm that kept UST pegged to the dollar was not a “magical machine” or “computer that functioned on its own” but instead, minting and burning done by market participants. The jury, as evidenced by their verdict, did not agree. A spokesperson for Terraform Labs told CoinDesk: “We are very disappointed with the verdict, which we do not believe is supported by the evidence. We continue to maintain that the SEC does not have the legal authority to bring this case at all, and we are carefully weighing our options and next steps.” Kwon was not in Manhattan for his civil trial; instead, he was stuck in Montenegro, where he had been since his arrest in March 2023. Kwon was caught en route to Dubai attempting to use fake Costa Rican travel documents after months on the run. Kwon also faces criminal charges in the U.S. and his native South Korea, which are tied to the implosion of the Terra ecosystem. Both countries are currently vying for his extradition, but his final destination remains unclear as Montenegro's Supreme Court weighs the competing requests. UPDATE (19:10 UTC April 5): The story was updated to include a comment from a Terraform Labs spokesperson.

Binance Coin’s [BNB] momentum declined over the last week as the coin didn’t showcase much volatility. However, this might be the prelude to a massive rally, as BNB’s price was sitting at a crucial level that could allow it to reach a new all-time high. The last week remained relatively less volatile, as the coin’s price moved down by just 1.5%. In fact, in the last 24 hours, the coin didn’t move much.  According to CoinMarketCap, at the time of writing, BNB was trading at $580.59 with a market capitalization of over $85.6 billion. But investors must not lose hope, as the coin has a trick up its sleeve. AMBCrypto’s analysis of the coin’s price chart revealed a bullish pennant pattern. BNB entered the pattern in mid-March and, since then, has consolidated inside it. At press time, the coin was close to breaking out of the bull pattern. A successful breakout could translate into a massive bull rally, allowing it to go above its March highs. If things fall into place, then the coin might as well go above its ATH of $661 in the coming weeks or months. Source: TradingView A few of the on-chain metrics also looked pretty optimistic for the coin, as they supported the possibility of a breakout of the bullish pattern. For instance, BNB’s Funding Rate remained low. Generally, prices tend to move the other way than Funding Rates, hinting at a price uptick in the coming days. Source: Santiment Another good news was that the coin’s trading volume declined over the last few days, while its price action remained bearish. This meant that investors were not actively trading BNB, suggesting that the bearish trend might last longer. However, sentiments around BNB remained bearish, as evident from its low Weighted Sentiment. Another concerning metric was the coin’s Long/Short Ratio, which dropped at press time. A low ratio denotes a bearish sentiment, in which there is a greater inclination to short or sell assets. Source: Coinglass AMBCrypto then analyzed BNB’s daily chart to better understand whether the coin is expecting a breakout. As per our analysis, BNB’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) moved sideways near the neutral mark. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also followed a similar trend. Is your portfolio green? Check out the BNB Profit Calculator Similarly, the coin tested its 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at press time. If BNB manages to go above its 20-day EMA, then the chances of a successful breakout from the bullish pattern would increase substantially.

However, in an unpredictable field, it is useful to have a tool that analyzes the behavioral phases of crypto trading instead of the price and trend confirmations. This is where the Gator Oscillator comes in handy. This guide dives into the Gator Oscillator, examining its practical applications, calculation method, and analytical benefits. Here’s why it’s an essential oscillator for those seeking precise trading signals without the overload of multiple indicators. The Gator Indicator, also termed the Gator Oscillator, is a derivative or a sourced version of the famous Alligator Indicator. While the alligator indicator is made of moving averages, the Gator Oscillator is made of histograms. This tool helps users visualize and interpret the market’s behavior, helping them make sense of the various phases leading to or following a trend. Did you know? The Gator Oscillator was created by Bill Williams, a 1932-born trader who also created the trend-following Alligator Indicator, the Market Facilitation Index (MFI), and price pattern-evaluating Fractals. The Gator Oscillator relies on histogram analysis and features two histograms to work with. The histograms above the zero line and below the zero line can be all red, all green, or a mix of both, depending on the state of the market or the cryptocurrency you are analyzing. The Gator Oscillator is a simplified version of the Alligator indicator. The former doesn’t directly identify the trend’s direction but only captures the mood. It helps the traders make sense of market phases by dividing moves into the sleeping, awakening, eating, and weakening phases. These phases, when viewed in combination with the Alligator Indicator’s moving averages and the price action, help you with decision-making and even risk management. The idea is to look for the histogram analysis patterns to turn green and red from all red before you can consider entering a long position. The risk management element is taken care of when you start closing your open position, and all the green bars turn green and red, hinting at a sating phase. The Gator Oscillator is still a lagging indicator, showcasing the trend’s strength rather than the direction unless you use it to analyze the trading divergence. The calculation principle of the Gator Oscillator is based on how the Alligator Indicator moves. Therefore, it is necessary first to understand the elements of the latter: Note: These are the lines and moving average levels set by Bill Williams. The TradingView Gator Oscillator settings, like any other TradingView Indicator, could have slightly different values for the moving average. Notice how in the above TradingView Gator Oscillator and Alligator Indicator representation, the 5-period line is green, and the 13-period Jawline is red. In this case, the teeth are the blue line and smoothed as 9-period instead of 8-period of showcase mid-term trends instead of short-term. Each moving average is shifted forward by 8-period, 5-period, and 3-period to reduce the effects of the lagging indicator and make the Gator indicator more forward-looking. Now that the base is all set, let us focus on the calculation: As mentioned earlier, the Gator Oscillator comprises dual histograms comprising upper and lower bars. Each upper bar is the absolute difference between the 13-period and 8-period/9-period smoothed averages. Each lower bar is the difference between the 8-period/9-period and 5-period moving averages. The bars can be green and red, depending on the nature of the trend. We shall look into this while reading a gator oscillator. Reading the Gator Oscillator is all about understanding the elements. Notably, while this oscillator helps with the entry and exit points, it can signal the trend direction, provided you know how to read the trading divergence. The easiest way to read is to understand the phases of the Gator Oscillator, along with the colors. If both the histogram bars are red, expect the price action to be in the sleeping phase. This shows the market is in a consolidation phase, not rife for entry. If one histogram is in green and the other is in red, or are there multiple green-red bars, you might be looking at the awakening phase. This might reveal clear entry points and the potential start of a forming up trend. If both the histogram bars are green, expect the market to be in the eating phase. This is where traders take most of the profit, capitalizing on the momentum. When, after the eating phase, the bars again start showing mixed colors — red and green, you can expect the trend to lose momentum. This is where most traders exit positions and book profits. The size of the bars also reveals a lot in terms of price action. For instance, if the green and red bars in the awakening phase are smaller than the sleeping phase, you might want to look at other indicators and wait for a different entry point. If the price action and the formation of bars (bar size even) move in different directions, you might be looking at trading divergence. For instance, check the chart below. Despite the formation of red and green histogram bars, the price of BTC corrected instead of rising, as the bars were smallish and not aligned with the price action. Important: If the bars in the awakening zone are smaller than the ones encountered in the previous phase, the trend is not solid, and the price action might trade sideways for a while. Now that we know how to read this indicator, let’s take the BTC price chart and try to use the Gator Oscillator in real-time crypto trading. We shall now look at the historical chart of Bitcoin, starting in 2021 and following all the way till the peak formed towards the end of that year. The first encircled zone hints at a consolidation or sleeping phase with all-red, smallish bars. Then came the awakening phase with the broadening green bars and occasional red here and there. After this came the price surge, taking BTC to a new high of almost $58,000. Immediately after this high, the Gator indicator started showing green and red bars, hinting a correction and space for traders to exit the trade. The entire short-term journey is depicted by the A to D pathway. Note that these phases were between January and February 2021, and BTC embarked on several such journeys to reach a peak of almost $69,000 by the end of the year. In 2024, the price of BTC seems to be trading in the sleeping zone, slowly transitioning to the awakening zone. Yet, it is noticeable that the bars in the awakening zone aren’t as big as the ones in the last sated phase. This shows that BTC might keep moving in a range for now, making short-term highs and lows only from the trading perspective. Notice how the weekly BTC chart reveals a more accurate formation of the Gator Oscillator. The ellipse highlighting the oscillator’s specific zone reveals the eating zone, after which the sated zone arrives quickly with sizeable green and red bars. Based on the historical analysis, we expect the price action to be muted for a while before BTC enters the sleeping zone. After that, we need to look for the color and size of the bars, per the histogram analysis, to locate the next leg of the trend. However, besides the technical analysis, broader crypto market sentiments also plays a key role in determining BTC’s price action. “Technical analysis is massively important and should not be ignored. Sentiment is a great way to gauge markets too, and news does move the market in unexpected ways sometimes. But more often than not we can at least get some early indications in the charts. I.e, Bitcoin at 73k saw seven months of green candles, a near historic run, a correction was coming if you could think without greed and euphoria clouding your mind. A MACD bear cross came the day after hitting the high; an early warning sign of trouble to come. But while this was happening the market was wildly euphoric, Blackrock ETF buyers bought a billion that day. So, yes, sentiment is important but it works as a counter indicator. Try to think against the herd.” The Gator Oscillator is best read with the Alligator Indicator. This means it is imperative to locate the oscillator’s awakening phase when the Alligator Indicator’s moving averages start diverging in the following order — 5-period, 8-period/9-period, and 13-period. At its heart, the Alligator Indicator is all about finding the golden crossover patterns in relation to the price action. The Gator Oscillator helps validate these patterns. The Gator Oscillator is a secondary indicator you pair with the Alligator moving averages. The histogram bars take shape depending on the convergence and divergence of the Alligator or the primary indicator. For near-accurate technical analysis, you might want to pair the Gator Oscillator with the following crypto trading indicators: MACD helps locate the potential reversals and trend-based momentum. To use the Gator Oscillator with the MACD indicator, you might want to focus on the convergence and divergence between the two indicators to get the strongest possible trading signals. The Bitcoin price action chart shows the blue line of the MACD threatening to drop under the orange line, hinting at bearishness. The sated phase or zone of the Gator Oscillator validates the MACD-specific finding. Both these indicators suggest that BTC might move in a range or even correct a little in the short-to-mid-term. The relative strength indicator measures the price change and speed of price action, eventually helping to determine oversold and overbought market conditions. Using it with the gator oscillator is simple. You need to locate an RSI divergence, bullish or bearish, and analyze it with the existing zone of the oscillator is in. Besides these indicators, crypto traders must value fundamental analysis for long-term wealth creation. The most successful people in the financial world like Buffet, Dalio, Soros, Marks and Lynch are not day traders and don't use technical analysis. That stuff works, but not for most people and it's not the optimal way to get rich from #crypto. Fundamental analysis is 😘 And… If you want to use the Gator Oscillator to transform your trading performance, here are the best strategies to follow: Even though the Gator Oscillator is a powerful trading tool that helps you identify the sentiment of the trading crowd — calm, excited, or somewhere in the middle — it is best paired with other trading indicators, especially trend-confirming ones like RSI. Additionally, it’s important to note that the Gator Oscillator indicator works best across a longer timeframe. This means it works best with more established/mature cryptocurrencies with discernable historical data to analyze. Trading with the Gator Oscillator requires you to choose a longer time frame, say weekly. Once you have the weekly chart, look for a phase when the histogram analysis, relative to the mid-line of the histogram, showcases big, red-green bars after a smallish all-red bar phase. This is termed the awakening phase, when most traders enter long positions. The Alligator strategy does offer reliable trading signals. When paired with the price action, this is one of the trading indicators that uses short-term moving averages for technical analysis. Alligator strategy works well in crypto market analysis as you capture the asset’s volatility without relying on multiple trading indicators. The Alligator pattern in crypto trading corresponds to the multiple behavioral phases of the alligator — sleeping, waking, eating, and sating — to analyze the inclination of traders. Trading oscillators like the Gator Oscillator are formed using the alligator pattern and are useful for helping traders locate the best times to enter and exit crypto trading positions. Reading a Gator indicator is easy. Use histogram analysis, keeping the middle or zero lines as a reference. If the bars on both sides of the middle line are red, the price action or trend is expected to be sleeping. You might wish to enter trades if the bars turn green and red. However, it is important to note that the bar size during the awakening or trade-entering phase shouldn’t be smaller than the sleeping phase. After that comes a phase where all bars are green, relevant to the middle line. This is where you, as a trader, can book most profits. You should exit trades before the histogram bars again turn red-green.

The New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) cleared the fund group — managing $106 billion in assets — to operate as a limited purpose trust company under the state’s banking law, WisdomTree said Friday. The charter allows the firm to custody digital assets, as well as issue, exchange and manage the reserves of DFS-approved stablecoins. The newly formed WisdomTree Digital Trust Company intends to issue its gold and dollar tokens and maintain reserves for those assets, the company noted. The company is also set to make its WisdomTree Prime app available to New York customers in the coming weeks, the firm said in a news release.

Eric Balchunas predicts sustained growth for spot Bitcoin ETFs, highlighting increased demand.::Spot Bitcoin ETFs have successfully reversed April’s outflows within the first two weeks of May. Eric Balchunas, Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg, highlighted that Bitcoin ETFs have already attracted $1.3 billion in inflows this month, effectively countering April’s negative outflows. This brings the total inflows to $12.3 billion since their inception. Balchunas emphasized that fluctuations in capital movements are a natural aspect of ETFs and should not concern investors. He remains confident that spot Bitcoin ETFs will deliver positive long-term returns. CryptoQuant reports that this resurgence in activity is coupled with renewed demand for Bitcoin. Both regular holders and large investors are increasing their Bitcoin holdings, indicating a heightened market interest. Recent data from SoSo Value confirms that spot Bitcoin ETFs have experienced a robust recovery from April’s downturn. On May 16, these funds reported $257.34 million in inflows. Leading the pack is BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which secured $94 million in inflows, boosting its assets under management to $18 billion, just shy of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC). On the same day, GBTC recorded a net daily inflow of $5 million, marking the third consecutive trading day it closed in positive territory since its transition from a trust to a spot ETF. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

What to expect next?::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Bitcoin (BTC) may have exited the post-halving “danger zone” and entered the accumulation phase, according to data shared by technical analyst Rekt Capital. He suggests that the selling pressure behind Bitcoin’s price is weakening. #BTC The Post-Halving Bitcoin "Danger Zone" (purple) is officially over And Bitcoin is celebrating with a good bounce from the Re-Accumulation Range Low support$BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin https://t.co/3pvWKRAqNd pic.twitter.com/KRD2UNDZiT — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) May 13, 2024 Following the halving event, Bitcoin typically experiences a “danger zone” characterized by heightened volatility. In the 2016 cycle, Bitcoin’s value dropped nearly 18% in the three weeks that followed. This specific downturn came back in this halving cycle, albeit with a mild 6.5% decline over the same period. However, this was briefly followed by a 15% surge, suggesting a strong exit from the “danger zone”. At the time of reporting, Bitcoin is trading at nearly $62,600, marking a 3% increase in the last 24 hours. Rekt Capital notes that the $60,000 support level is crucial for the continuation of this upward trend, potentially leading to a return to the $68,000 mark. “History suggests it means that Bitcoin will no longer produce downside volatility below its current Re-Accumulation Range,” Rekt Capital explained in his recent blog post. “The Bitcoin correction should be over and price should be able to maintain itself above $60,000 going forward.” While historical trends do not guarantee future results, the current support level’s resilience is a positive sign for Bitcoin’s trajectory. A major focus this week will be the April Consumer Price Index (CPI), which will be released on Wednesday. Forecasts for the CPI and core CPI are 3.4% and 3.6%, respectively. The Federal Reserve’s (Fed) target is 2% and current data shows inflation remains stubborn. Rates might stay high for a longer period unless inflation improves. According to BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes, rising government debt and adjustments by the Fed and US Treasury are making alternative investments like Bitcoin more appealing. He predicts that Bitcoin’s price will exceed $60,000 and move to a period of relative stability between $60,000 and $70,000 by August. The upcoming US presidential election could also influence Bitcoin’s value, according to Standard Chartered. The bank believes a potential win for Donald Trump could benefit Bitcoin’s value. Additionally, the US’s fiscal and monetary policy shift is seen as potentially favorable for Bitcoin. Standard Chartered expects BTC’s price to reach $150,000 by year’s end and $200,000 by 2025.

13::https://theconversation.com/protecting-the-right-to-be-forgotten-in-the-age-of-blockchain-104847::The Conversation::article::Protecting the ‘right to be forgotten’ in the age of blockchain::Blockchain data is unchangeable, which is a problem when privacy laws require companies to delete data once it’s served its purpose.::There’s been a lot of hype about blockchain over the past year. Although best known as the technology that underpins Bitcoin, blockchain is starting to disrupt other industries, from supply chains to energy trading. One of the key selling points of blockchain is that once data is added to the chain, it can’t be changed or removed. This makes blockchain trustworthy. But this same immutability makes blockchain problematic in a world where privacy laws require companies to delete your data from databases once it has served its purpose. This is known in some jurisdictions as the “right to be forgotten”. We have designed a blockchain in which users can remove their data from the database without violating blockchain’s consistency. Read more: Blockchain is useful for a lot more than just Bitcoin There is currently a growing market of Internet of Things devices, from smart homes and self-driving cars to voice assistants and smart energy meters. These devices continuously collect digital biographies of our lives. As this data is increasingly being stored on blockchains, the tension between blockchain and the right to be forgotten will only increase. Our tool could help. At its core, blockchain is a database that is jointly managed by a distributed set of participants. Whenever new data is added to the database, all the participants must agree to verify it. In this way, blockchain removes the need for a third-party, such as a bank, to verify transactions. The blockchain ledger is organised into blocks, where each block is linked to the previous block through cryptographic hash functions. These functions create a short code based on the content of the previous block, and it is not possible to guess this code without trying all possible codes. Chaining the blocks in this manner ensures that the data stored in them cannot be altered, as any changes made would break the blockchain consistency. This makes blockchains immutable. It also makes blockchain data easy to trace and audit, particularly for large networks like the Internet of Things. These features are highly attractive for organisations operating across organisational boundaries, and in environments where participants may not fully trust each other. The European Union’s recent General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a significant piece of legislation that is at odds with a digital economy underpinned by blockchain. The GDPR requires companies that hold people’s data to erase that data once the original purpose they needed it for is complete. That means that people must be able to remove their data from third party databases after a certain period of time. Blockchain – being unchangeable – presents an obstacle to exercising that right. Read more: What Wikipedia can teach us about blockchain technology Let’s say you live in smart home that uses sensor data to monitor your home security. You have a home insurance policy and, in order to receive lower premiums, you allow your smoke alarm and security sensor data to be recorded on a blockchain. The blockchain data can be accessed by the police, the fire department and the insurance company so they can audit any smoke alarm or security events. Once your insurance period has ended, you should be able to remove your security data from the blockchain to enhance your privacy. If you left your data on the blockchain indefinitely, that would increase the risk of your data being identified as yours, and your activities being tracked by any entity with access to the blockchain. A blockchain participant typically uses one or more public keys as its identities. The transactions in blockchain are stored anonymously, as there is no direct link between the public keys and the real participant identity. But a breach in identity in any of the transactions, for instance by linking the transaction content to other known data about the user, leads to all interactions of the users’s devices, stored in blockchain, to be tracked by all blockchain participants. So being able to the remove data from the blockchain without “breaking the chain” would be beneficial for user privacy. It would also be beneficial to save storage space on the servers that store blockchain ledgers. But currently, removing data from a blockchain is not possible without breaking the blockchain’s consistency. We have come up with a solution that makes it possible to remove your detailed transaction data from a blockchain database, without removing the auditable trace that the transaction took place. As described in our peer-reviewed publication this month, Memory Optimised Flexible Blockchain allows you to temporarily store, summarise, or completely remove your transactions from blockchain, while maintaining the blockchain’s consistency. The remaining trace of the data (its hash) on the blockchain can still be used in the future, in case disputes over what happened arise. For instance, if a home owner wanted to verify that a break-in took place at their house under a previous insurance policy, they could provide a private copy of the data with its associated hash. A legal authority could then compare the hash of the person’s data with the hash that is still stored on the shared blockchain and thereby validate the authenticity of the person’s claim. This approach provides you with full administrative control of your blockchain-stored data. It makes it possible for you to remove or summarise this data, without sacrificing the ability to audit the data in the future. Read more: Using blockchain to secure the 'internet of things' It is important to note that our published approach can run atop any existing blockchain solution, and does not affect the blockchain consistency. The links among blocks through hash functions are preserved, even as specific blocks are removed or summarised from the chain. In other words, the link of any blockchain entry remains, but the bag containing some data can be cut loose. In fact, as long as the removed content is stored privately outside of the blockchain, the data’s authenticity can be independently verified at a later time by comparing it against the hash in the blockchain. In this way, you can reclaim control of any previously shared data and exercise your right to be forgotten in the age of blockchain.::2018-10-30T18:56:34Z::Blockchain, Data privacy, GDPR, Right to be forgotten::Ali Dorri::Home::https://images.theconversation.com/files/242650/original/file-20181029-7056-6xa09e.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C440%2C7000%2C3500&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

The ETCs, which carry the Frankfurt-based company's Xtrackers branding, were developed in conjunction with digital asset financial services firm Galaxy Digital (GLXY). They were listed on the Deutsche Boerse on Thursday, according to a DWS statement. The products, the Xtrackers Galaxy Physical Bitcoin ETC and Xtrackers Galaxy Physical Ethereum ETC, track the performance of the two largest cryptocurrencies by market value and carry a fee of 0.35%. That's cheaper than rivals such as 21Shares Bitcoin ETP (ABTC), listed in Switzerland and Germany, which charges 1.49%, and Amsterdam-listed Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF (BCOIN) with 1.5% While spot crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) have been available in Europe for several years – CoinShares' Physical Bitcoin ETP, for example, was listed in 2021, and Zurich-based 21Shares says it introduced the world's first physically backed ETP in 2018 – they've come more into focus since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved a bunch of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the world's biggest economy in January. The U.S. funds have attracted a net inflow of about $12 billion in less than three months, according to BitMEX Research. DWS, which has 896 billion euros ($970 billion) under management, and Galaxy Digital teamed up a year ago to develop exchange-traded products (ETPs) for listing in Europe.

Cardano [ADA] has surged back to the $0.48 price point, which is a major turnaround as billions in investments move from loss to potential profit. This comeback comes at an important time for holders who bought at or above this threshold, changing the sentiment from red to a promising green. Investors who placed their bets on ADA at the average price of $0.48 are now seeing their patience pay off. With the token reclaiming that value, those previously underwater are finally breaking even.  A predominantly bullish sentiment is showcased by IntoTheBlock’s data, which indicates a “Mostly Bullish” outlook by investors at press time. This upswing is underpinned by a modest 0.11% net network growth and a 3.08% increase in holders ‘In the Money,’ meaning that a larger number of investors are seeing profits. Source: IntoTheBlock However, investors should remain cautious, as the dashboard also reveals a -7.46% drop in large transactions, suggesting a decrease in major institutional activities. Furthermore, a notable bid-ask volume imbalance (-16.57%) points towards potential selling pressure. This means it is necessary to be vigilant of market dynamics in order to ascertain the sustainability of this rally in ADA’s price. The one-hour ADA trading chart showed an uptick in price movement, briefly touching the $0.48 mark before consolidating around $0.4776 at press time. The volume spike accompanying the price rise confirmed strong buyer interest at lower price levels. But the bulls are still not in full control. This consolidation indicates a balancing act between the bulls and the bears, with neither side taking definitive control. Source: TradingView Read Cardano’s [ADA] Price Prediction 2024-25 Given the current consolidation pattern and the observed trading volume, ADA may continue to test the $0.48 resistance. If buyer momentum increases, breaking this level could see further gains, otherwise, expect some sideways movement as the market seeks new catalysts or data points to drive the next price action.

Polkadot launched in 2020, aiming to develop a network of blockchain platforms akin to Ethereum. It features a main chain known as the relay chain and several parallel chains or parachains. Developers build these parachains on top of the Polkadot protocol. Each operates with its own rules and policies, essentially functioning as independent decentralized applications (DApps). Polkadot operates on a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus method, requiring users to stake or lock in their assets to participate. This enhances network security and allows users to earn interest as a reward for their involvement. First, I have to explain to you step by step the current system so you can understand where I'm going ➡️ Polkadot has a relay chain or 'main chain' which provides security, consensus, and interoperability to the parachains connected to it 🔌. To obtain all these advantages of… pic.twitter.com/8kRsmdUH06 The parachains handle and process the transactions, which are sent to the relay chain for final validation. This two-step process reduces congestion on the relay chain, enabling Polkadot to scale efficiently and process more than 1000 transactions per second. DOT, the native cryptocurrency of the Polkadot network, is essential for governance, staking, and bonding parachains, highlighting its fundamental role within the Polkadot ecosystem. By bonding parachains through DOT, users help to secure new chains to the Polkadot network, further promoting an interconnected crypto community. As of May 1, 2024, the price of Polkadot is $6.78 as per CoinMarketCap data, with a market cap of $9,754,511,094. The coin reached its all-time high of $55.00 on Nov. 4, 2021. Choosing the best wallet to store DOT involves considering various factors to ensure your crypto assets’ security and functionality. Additionally, it’s important to learn how to properly set up a crypto wallet to ensure your assets remain secure. When selecting a wallet, assess ease of use and security measures. Here are some pointers to include in your decision-making and investment process: Ultimately, the best Polkadot wallet depends on your specific needs, and it’s important to consider your own personal requirements before making your choice. For example, eToro Wallet offers access to traditional stocks as well as crypto. OKX Wallet supports DOT while offering a gateway to web3. With YouHodler Wallet, users can engage in lending and other DeFi services. Ledger is a top hardware wallet option for long-term HODLers, while Coinbase Wallet is the perfect entry point for those new to crypto. Always DYOR, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. DOT is the native coin of the Polkadot network, specifically designed for governance, staking, and bonding to facilitate the connection of parachains. This crypto enables unique functionalities within the Polkadot ecosystem, enhancing interoperability and scalability. Before investing in Polkadot, you should consider your investment goals and risk tolerance. The network’s innovative multi-chain architecture may provide long-term growth potential. However, investing in any crypto carries inherent risks. Remember to assess the current market dynamics and do your own research beforehand. To store DOT securely, BeInCrypto highly recommends using platforms such as Coinbase Wallet, OKX Wallet, Ledger, YouHodler Wallet, or eToro. These options offer various features that meet the needs of both beginners and seasoned users, ensuring safe storage for your DOT.

Weeks after FTX collapsed, CEO David Solomon penned an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal asserting that experienced institutions should be leading the path. “Although some blockchain start-ups are calling for regulatory oversight, not all have the capability to meet such requirements because they are young organizations,” Solomon wrote in the op-ed. Policy developments around the digital asset space are encouraging, McDermott said, and allow for more financial institutions to enter the space. From our opinion section: DeFi needs institutions — and regulation “I look at the regulatory landscape globally and at how that’s progressed in the last couple years, and…it’s actually been pretty remarkable,” McDermott said. “That has actually given a lot of clarity and confidence, quite frankly, for probably a lot of the traditional players to really kind of move forward and invest in this space.” When asked if and when the bank may expand its on-chain services via public blockchains, McDermott said there are currently some compliance hurdles, but he hopes the team can move in that direction. “Personally, I can see a huge opportunity there,” McDermott said. “But if I put my Goldman hat on, I just know what we can do from a regulatory perspective. It’s something that I think we kind of monitor [and] watch mature.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. Subscribe to the Empire newsletter.

More than 80 billion NOT tokens have been distributed, with a significant majority, exceeding 90%, delivered directly to participants engaged as “miners” on the platform. Notcoin, a pioneering play-to-earn clicker game that operates via the Telegram app, announced its recent airdrop through an official press release. The initiative saw the allocation of over 80.2 billion NOT tokens to community members active on The Open Network blockchain. According to the announcement, 90% of these tokens have been designated for “miners,” while the remaining 7.9 billion are accessible through the redemption of non-fungible token (NFT) vouchers. This development precedes Notcoin’s anticipated inclusion on various prominent centralized exchanges, including Binance, OKX, and Bybit. Eligible community members can claim their NOT tokens within the Notcoin app, with provisions for on-chain withdrawal concurrent with the token’s exchange listing, as detailed in the press release. Ryan Dennis, the Brand Director at TON Foundation, remarked on the game’s rapid ascent and cultural impact. “Notcoin has not only emerged as the fastest-growing and most popular game in blockchain history, but it has also become a cultural phenomenon, cultivating one of the largest and most engaged communities in the Web3 space,” he stated. Sasha Plotvinov, founder of Open Builders—a collective of blockchain developers centered around The Open Network—emphasized the ecosystem’s commitment to transparency and equitable distribution. He noted that these principles are vital for fostering realistic visions of mass crypto adoption. Launched in late 2023, Notcoin has innovatively leveraged The Open Network blockchain to offer a unique gaming experience. Players engage by “mining” NOT tokens through simple screen taps while operating the Notcoin mini-app on mobile devices. Following the game’s traction, the Notcoin team facilitated the conversion of in-game balances to NOT tokens at a ratio of 1000:1, thereby transforming every thousand in-game Notcoin into one NOT token. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

19::https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-layer-2-expansion/::Crypto Briefing::article::Bitcoin layer-2 landscape "set to boom" as BTC keeps outperforming: Bybit::Bitcoin Layer 2s gain momentum with new solutions and increased security.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Bitcoin (BTC) layer-2 (L2) blockchains will continue to grow as BTC continues to outperform other major crypto in 2024, according to a report by crypto exchange Bybit. Bitcoin’s market dominance has surged to 51.1% as of May 7, signaling a robust uptrend since late September 2023. This growth is largely attributed to the US approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which has bolstered Bitcoin’s trading volume. Bybit reports an 18% increase in BTC holdings month-over-month from March to April 2024, with Bitcoin’s trading volume now representing 31.8% of the total. The L2 landscape is enhancing the utility of BTC and leveraging the security of Bitcoin mining. While they face challenges due to the Bitcoin blockchain’s architecture and community resistance to change, the success of projects like Ordinals and Runes suggests that innovation can drive community growth. As Bitcoin maintains its proof of work (PoW) status and outperforms other blockchains, the potential for Bitcoin L2 development remains vast. This growth has catalyzed the development of Bitcoin L2 solutions, designed to enhance scalability, reduce transaction costs, and introduce programmability to the Bitcoin network. These solutions include state channels, sidechains, and rollups. State channels like the Lightning Network facilitate faster, more cost-effective transactions by allowing off-chain updates between parties. However, they face limitations in capacity and lack smart contract functionality. RGB, a new project, aims to overcome these challenges by integrating smart contract capabilities with the Lightning Network. Sidechains operate independently but maintain a connection to the Bitcoin mainnet through bridges, enabling asset transfers. Projects like Stacks and Rootstock are well-established, while newcomers like AILayer boast the highest total value locked (TVL) due to its AI integration and anticipated airdrop. Rollups, which batch transactions for settlement on the mainnet, are divided into optimistic and zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups. ZK-rollups, in particular, are favored for their lower transaction costs. Merlin Chain leads the ZK-rollup space with a TVL of $1.1 billion, thanks to its early launch and vibrant DApp ecosystem. Despite these advancements, Bitcoin L2 solutions face inherent risks, including security vulnerabilities, interoperability challenges, and counterparty risks, Bybit points out. These risks mirror those encountered by early Ethereum L2 solutions.

20::https://theconversation.com/blockchains-wont-fix-internet-voting-security-and-could-make-it-worse-104830::The Conversation::article::Blockchains won’t fix internet voting security – and could make it worse::The stability and integrity of democratic society are too important to be relegated to inherently flawed computer systems that are vulnerable to malfunctions and malicious attacks.::Looking to modernize voting practices, speed waiting times at the polls, increase voter turnout and generally make voting more convenient, many government officials – and some companies hawking voting systems – are looking to an emerging technology called a “blockchain.” That’s what’s behind a West Virginia program in which some voters serving abroad in the military will be able to cast their votes from their mobile devices. Similar voting schemes have been tried elsewhere in various places around the world. As researchers in the Initiative for CryptoCurrencies and Contracts, we believe in the transformative potential of blockchain systems in a number of industries. Best known as the technology behind bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, blockchains can do much more than allow anonymous strangers to send each other money without fear of fraud or tampering. They have created new ways for people to invest in technology ventures that have attracted billions of dollars, and may someday store records that make educational credentials, land ownership and food origins more transparent and harder to forge. Blockchains might sound like an ideal remedy for the trust problems caused by internet voting. Data can only be added to a blockchain – not deleted or changed – because multiple copies are stored on computers owned by different people or organizations and perhaps spread across different countries. Strict controls can be placed on a blockchain’s contents, preventing unauthorized data from being added. And blockchains are designed to be transparent – with their contents often readable by anyone’s computing device anywhere in the world. Yet as scholars who have studied traditional and blockchain-based voting, we believe that while blockchains may help with some specific issues, they can’t fix the basic problems with internet voting. In fact, they could make things worse. For years, experts on election security have warned that the internet is too dangerous for such socially crucial and time-sensitive functions as voting. Renowned cryptographer Ronald Rivest, for instance, has remarked that “Best practices for internet voting are like best practices for drunk driving” – there’s no safe way to do either one. The stakes are enormous. Democracy requires widespread public trust – not just that a declared winner actually received the largest number of votes, but in the integrity of the system as a whole. People need to trust that the votes they cast are the ones that are counted, that their neighbors’ votes are totaled accurately and not the result of bribery or coercion and that local tallies are communicated safely to state election officials. Even advanced computing devices today cannot provide such assurances. Most hardware and software are rife with hidden security flaws, and are not regularly updated. Devices are vulnerable, and so are networks. Internet outages – even caused by trivialities like gamers trying to get a leg up on their competitors – could prevent people from voting. Intentional, targeted attacks against internet traffic could cause major disruptions to democratic institutions on a national scale. The stability and integrity of democratic society itself are too important to be relegated to flawed computer systems. Hackers – backed by foreign governments or not – are always looking for new targets and fresh ways to sow social discord. They’ll find – and fully exploit – any technical weaknesses available to them. Without a paper trail, the very possibility that someone could have secretly changed votes will further erode public trust in democratic elections.  A key method by which blockchain voting could worsen election integrity is by claiming to increase trustworthiness without actually doing so. It’s easy to imagine a voting system in which only authorized voters could cast ballots, with those ballots indelibly recorded on a blockchain. The blockchain would act as a single authoritative election record that could not be erased or tampered with. For all intents and purposes, the record would be hack-proof. However, tallying votes on a blockchain doesn’t magically make a voter’s phone or computer secure. A vote may be securely recorded, but that means nothing if the vote was cast incorrectly to begin with. If your phone is infected with malware that switches your vote from Candidate R to Candidate D, it doesn’t matter how secure the rest of the voting system is – the election has still been hacked. In some cases, blockchains may be able to help voters detect that sort of tampering – but only if the hack-detection software itself hasn’t been hacked. In addition, some companies’ business practices undermine the potential to trust their blockchain systems. The manufacturer of the system West Virginia will use in November – like many companies manufacturing physical voting machines – is refusing to embrace the transparency that is central to the security industry, the blockchain community, and democracy itself. They are not providing public access to the cryptographic protocols at the heart of their systems, leaving the public instead to rely on the manufacturer’s promises of security. There’s no way for an independent auditor to be truly certain that the systems are free of subtle bugs or security flaws – or even massive holes that would be obvious to experts. Another way blockchain voting could worsen existing voting problems is by increasing the likelihood of vote buying. Sometimes a glass of beer is all that’s needed to bribe a voter. Vote buying is happily rare in large-scale U.S. elections, in part because the secret ballot makes verifying a bought vote very difficult and because there are serious criminal penalties. Internet voting could completely negate both of these protections. Putting votes on blockchains eliminates the secrecy of the voting booth. Encryption doesn’t help: Software can prove mathematically to a vote buyer that a voter’s device encrypted the name of a particular candidate. In addition, foreigners who might try to influence people’s votes are very hard to prosecute. Some voting companies contend that their systems publicly identify voters only by random numerical identifiers, so they aren’t subject to vote-buying or intimidation. But in many of these systems, voting identities can be linked to accounts in cryptocurrency systems – where a voter could receive a bribe, potentially without revealing who was paid, how much or by whom. Officials and companies who promote online voting are creating a false sense of security – and putting the integrity of the election process at risk. In seeking to use blockchains as a protective element, they may in fact be introducing new threats into the crucial mechanics of democracy.::2018-10-18T10:34:12Z::Blockchain, Cybersecurity, Democracy, Election integrity, Online voting, Public trust, Voting, e-voting, voting integrity::Ari Juels::Home::https://images.theconversation.com/files/240662/original/file-20181015-165894-6jjdjj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C1404%2C6006%2C2998&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

Gold has outperformed, and this may benefit bitcoin (BTC), Coinbase (COIN) said in a research report on Friday. “Given the market’s recent hawkish views on rate cuts, we think gold’s performance signals an overweighting on inflation relative to Fed rate changes as well as an overall belief that certain inflation bumps could materialize more problematically than anticipated,” the report said. “Bitcoin’s increased acceptance as a form of ‘digital gold’ could enable demand from a new subset of investors in this regime,” wrote analyst David Han. “As a result, we think dips are likely to be more aggressively bought compared to previous cycles, even as volatility persists during price discovery.” Among other macroeconomic signals that inflation may not be entirely subdued, the U.S. jobs market continues to surprise to the upside. The economy added 303,000 jobs last month, the government said Friday. That's the strongest headline number since last May and it beat economist forecasts of 200,000 and February’s 270,000 additions. The cryptocurrency’s wider access to capital following the launch of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. could result in less volatility, according to the report. The capital unlocked by spot ETFs “perhaps represents the most fundamental shift in market structure between the previous 2020-21 cycle and today,” Coinbase said. This capital injection, coupled with the bitcoin halving coming later this month and other positive catalysts, makes Coinbase still largely positive on its outlook for crypto markets for the second quarter. The quadrennial halving is when miner rewards are slashed by 50%, thereby reducing the rate of growth in the supply of bitcoin. The next halving is expected to occur around April 20.

22::https://ambcrypto.com/why-polkadots-dot-price-bounce-will-not-come-anytime-soon/::AMBCrypto::article::Why Polkadot’s [DOT] price bounce will not come anytime soon::Despite a 6.61% weekly increase, DOT's decreased volume suggests market disinterest.::Despite a 6.61% weekly increase, DOT’s decreased volume suggests market disinterest.  A significant decrease in its daily trading volume has put Polkadot [DOT] at risk of another decline. Volume is not necessarily an indicator of a price increase. If the trading volume increases, it means that there is a lot of exchange going on with a token. Conversely, a decline in the metric suggests that interest in a cryptocurrency has decreased. For Polkadot, data from Artemis.xyz showed that the volume was $137.80 million. This was one of the lowest the project has seen since the second quarter of the year began.  However, the price of DOT has increased by 6.61% in the last seven days. But a massive decline in the volume could be a stumbling block to that hike. Source: Artemis Previously, there have been predictions that DOT could ride back to $10. If the volume pumps as the price increases, then this forecast might become a reality. But that was not the case, as rising prices and decreasing volume indicate weakness in the trend. As such, DOT could swing between $7.15 and $7.60 in the short term. Furthermore, AMBCrypto looked at Polkadot’s development activity as this was one aspect the project has dominated. According to Santiment, development activity on the network was 2.92. Two days ago, the reading of the metric was 2.20, indicating that more codes have been committed to ensure that Polkadot functions properly For some projects, a rise in development activity is a bullish sign for the price. But for DOT, it is not always the case. Sometimes, DOT’s price rises with the metric. Other times, the price does not follow. Therefore, this network improvement cannot be said to be a propeller to drive the token’s value higher. Apart from this, AMBCrypto checked the social volume. When social volume increases, it implies that the search for a project is increasing. On the other hand, if the social volume dwindles, it suggests that arbitrary text linked to DOT is on the decline. Source: Santiment At press time, Polkadot’s social volume jumped on the 17th of May. On the 18th, the metric fell. For the price, this means that demand for DOT was low. Hence, a 25%+ price increase might be unattainable in the short term. Meanwhile, the metrics discussed here are not the only one that has the potential to influence DOT’s price. Is your portfolio green? Check the Polkadot Profit Calculator To get a full understanding, other on-chain indicators like network growth can also impact the value. If the network growth rises, demand for DOT could lead the price to increase. However, that has not been the case, indicating that DOT’s potential to hit double-digits might not be an option this month.

While other trend-following crypto trading indicators for technical analysis include the Moving Average Convergence Divergence and the Parabolic SAR, the ZigZag indicator stands out for its simplistic approach in helping you identify swing highs and lows. This guide explores everything about the ZigZag Indicator, including its ability to spot potential bullish and bearish signals, usefulness across multiple timeframes, and best practices. The ZigZag pattern in crypto identifies and visualizes a clear pivot point that easily determines bullish and bearish trends. Notably, the pattern isn’t out-and-out predictive. Instead, it adjusts depending on changing market conditions. The pattern isolates movements that are essential for trend identification and price action monitoring. The ZigZag indicator is a technical analysis resource that can clearly identify swing highs and lows using straight lines. This indicator can be paired with the Fibonacci Retracement tool to help locate key support and resistance levels. Here are the basic features of this indicator: Look up "ZigZag" default indicator on TV. Might be handy for volume analysis as it calculates cumulative vol of each swings. I don't use vol for my index trades, but this could be useful for stocks swing trading on HTF pic.twitter.com/uoYXTNvRAW If you have previously used the Bollinger Bands indicator, you will know the importance of indicator settings. Let us look at what that means for the ZigZag and how the settings help in reading the indicator. The indicator depth signifies the lowest number of bars between the potential low and the potential high. As the name suggests, increasing the depth will result in fewer price-specific fluctuations, with the lines expected to move in one direction for longer. When the line reverses, indicating a reversal, the visualization becomes more significant. The deviation refers to the percentage of the minimum price move needed for the indicator to change course. If the deviation is set high, smaller price moves are flushed out. The depth and deviation settings also determine the minimum number of bars formed between the swing lows and highs, which the Backstep count determines. To calculate or plot the ZigZag indicator, you first need to choose a starting point. Say, for the sake of illustration, this is $67232, per the latest Bitcoin price chart (shown above). Now that we have chosen the deviation to be 10%, the next low would never be considered if the Bitcoin price doesn’t fall by 10% of $67,232. This is why you can see the line from the starting point continuing. Also, it is worth mentioning that the ZigZag is a lagging indicator and only captures the trend. It isn’t predictive in nature. Also, reading this indicator should always be done in tandem with chart patterns, candlestick analysis, Fibonacci retracement levels, and the Elliot Wave formations — all of which we will discuss while exploring trading strategies. Did you know? Candlestick charting, integral to technical analysis, was developed in 18th-century Japan by rice trader Munehisa Homma, who used it to interpret market emotions and investor sentiment. This technique gained global prominence in the 1980s through the works of Steve Nison. As for the best ZigZag indicator setting, you can use the following table as your trial-and-error guide, optimized for scalping, day trading, swing trading, and even long-term investing: At first glance, the ZigZag indicator doesn’t look like much. It is one of the more basic crypto trading indicators that follows price action. However, how you set the depth and deviation determines how strong the trend identification results are. Here are some of the crypto trading strategies that you can execute using the ZigZag indicator, along with the price action, histogram analysis, candlestick patterns, and a few other elements. The idea is simple. Once you apply the ZigZag indicator to the price action, you should look for lower highs during an uptrend and higher lows during a downtrend to identify a possible trend reversal. A historical validation of this strategy surfaced in December 2017, when BTC reached a high of almost $20,000. From that, it dipped all the way to $6000, showcasing significant market volatility. The subsequent swing high and the next swing low formed lower. This suggested a weakening trend and by December 2018, the price of Bitcoin dipped to almost $3000. The ZigZag indicator helps you locate the historical support and resistance levels. Notice how, in the case of BTC, the low made in December 2018 acted as a significant support level, which was respected during other downturns and corrective phases. Also, the prices surged in 2019 all the way up to $14,000 once Bitcoin managed to breach past the crucial resistance levels posed by all the lower high formations in 2018. If you are a trader interested in taking long positions, the ZigZag indicator can help you locate these key levels. Once these key levels are in, you can use them to place stop loss or even take profit orders, per your preferences. The ZigZag Indicator is at the very foundation of the Elliot Wave strategy. If you carefully observe any Elliot Wave pattern, say 1-2-3-4-5, you can see that the waves best align with the ZigZags. Plus, the corrective wave after the 1-5 impulse wave — the A-B-C wave — can also be sourced from the ZigZag indicator as part of the trend identification. Simply put, the ZigZag indicator helps visualize the Elliot Waves better. But then, to use this strategy, you need to understand the conditions/guidelines associated with Elliot Wave formation: Do note that these rules and guidelines aren’t set in stone. Under actual market conditions, there is room for some variation. With the Elliot Wave theory in place, you can even use volume analysis to place buy orders. You can combine the ZigZag swings with Fibonacci levels to locate additional support and resistance levels. The usage is simple — you need first to locate a swing high and then the swing low. Once done, you can connect the levels using the Fib indicator, giving you the possible support levels. Traders can use these support levels to look for breaches, rebounds, and ideal buying levels. Above is a BTC chart featuring the Fib retracement indicator connecting the swing high of $72,797 and the swing low of $59,600. Notice how the Fib indicator revealed a support level of $66838 at 61.8% of the indicator. A breach past this level, followed by a rebound and another breach, would have confirmed a positive move for Bitcoin. Instead, the price action couldn’t cross, nullifying any possible buying opportunity. ZigZag indicators are primarily straight lines. Therefore, you can use them to identify classical chart patterns like double tops, head and shoulders, triangles, and more. Below is a quick chart showing the double top formation at closer to $72,000 both times. This showed BTC bulls lacked strength, leading to a sizable price correction. ZigZag indicators can be used to work with momentum indicators and oscillators to help locate trading divergence. If you see that the bottom of the indicator, or the swing low of the ZigZag, coincides with an RSI peak, you might expect the prices to surge and vice versa. The same holds even when you are using the likes of the Gator Oscillator. Here are the key signals you need to look for while using the ZigZag indicator with the TradingView Gator Oscillator. #Bitcoin – $57,500 should be the bottom or its over ? On the weekly chart, the price is trading below the weekly support zone of $60,000. I see a lot of people calling for $50,000. The problem with this is if the price closes below the blue box, it would make the price action… pic.twitter.com/CQ9M9rNDC3 In addition to the mentioned strategies, you can look for key candlestick formations at the swing highs and swing lows to track potential reversals. Above is a quick example of it showing a “Bullish Harami” candlestick formation coinciding with the swing low for BTC at almost $65,000. The price moved to almost $73,000 within a few trading sessions. Note that besides these trading indicators, you must also rely on project fundamentals. “Fundamentals I’m talking about are quant measures of demand/supply. Anything that’s not TA on a price chart. These can be short timeframes. Includes – order book auction – futures demand via funding – flows into exchanges – open interest – on-chain liquidity shifts” The ZigZag indicator is one of the more reliable crypto trading indicators around. It fixes minor price fluctuations to accurately represent swing highs and lows, making it a powerful tool against the crypto market volatility. Furthermore, it works with most trading oscillators and chart analysis tools across multiple timeframes, making it one of the more flexible crypto trading resources. Overall, ZigZag is relatively accurate and offers bankable signals, making it a useful tool for traders operating in decentralized asset markets. To trade using the ZigZag indicator, you first need to adjust the settings based on your trading preferences, which will then help you smooth out the price action and locate the accurately identified swing highs and lows. Once done, you can apply the indicator for trend identification, getting hold of the bullish and bearish signals. Besides that, this indicator can even help you locate trading signals by presenting the right and usable patterns. The ZigZag trading algorithm represents a systematic method where the indicator is used to identify pivotal price movements. The algorithm works in the backend and filters the price moves, identifies the price reversals, and eventually helps with chart analysis and devise a handful of crypto trading strategies. Even though there is no perfect indicator setting for ZigZag, a good way forward is to go with a 5% deviation and a depth number of 12. These settings work well for day trading and even swing trading amid the crypto market volatility. Options trading is all about determining the buying and selling pressure across the concerned crypto counter. This is why the RSI indicator can be a good tool followed by the likes of Gator Oscillator. On TradingView Gator Oscillator, RSI and price action can be implemented at once to locate the right trading signals. Well, no single indicator can claim to be the most accurate. However, the MACD or Moving Average Convergence Divergence is known to offer clear cut trading signals via histogram analysis.

24::https://blockworks.co/news/blockchain-better-middlemen-swift::Blockworks::article::Blockchain really is better than middlemen::Opinion: The SWIFT system's forays into blockchain hint that one day the technology can replace intermediaries.::SWIFT’s forays into blockchain hint that one day the tech can replace intermediaries Soumyabrata Roy/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks The need for an organization connecting all banks is clear in today’s hyper-globalized economy where funds, goods and services are sent across every corner of the globe. So as globalization expanded, our deeply interconnected and centralized financial system triggered the development of SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) in 1973, a member-owned messaging network for financial institutions to send secure communications as well as verify and settle inter-bank transactions. SWIFT connects more than 11 thousand financial institutions across 200 countries and territories — long serving as a unified and stable institution amid a complex and volatile world order. But recently, the exclusion of many sanctioned Iranian and Russian banks from SWIFT prompted China and other nations to launch competing alternative intermediaries. This has led to the wide-scale rethinking of how to structure international finance. While barring certain institutions from SWIFT due to connections with state-sponsored violence, terror or other criminal activity is appropriate, fractionalizing centralized entities into siloed, competing groups poses a long-term threat to global finance. Changing attitudes toward centralized finance and innovative fintech applications further undermine the current financial system and highlight its shortcomings. Meanwhile, the rise of blockchain-based trading solutions has led those in the traditional financial sector to question the role of intermediaries. There is a growing consideration into how this technology can enhance the speed and frequency of interbank transactions. After all, the primary goal of Bitcoin and the broader crypto movement was to eliminate what seemed to be an unjust financial order. This order, dominated by large banks and financial institutions, wielded censorship and control over the world’s population, particularly in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Despite being largely opposed to crypto and blockchain until only a few years ago, financial institutions are now embracing blockchain as a technology, crypto as an investment opportunity and DeFi as a sandbox for innovative financial products. Read more from our opinion section: Bitcoin ETFs in conservative portfolios is good for crypto — and Wall Street This recognition of blockchain’s upside showcases its capability and effectiveness at removing the middleman. Further validating this were recent announcements that SWIFT, in collaboration with more than 12 major financial institutions, is experimenting with interoperable on-chain token transfers and tokenization. Together with SWIFT’s messaging technology, Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) and a public Ethereum testnet are facilitating the routing of messages between legacy banking systems. This alone should legitimize the idea that digital assets and blockchains are legitimate infrastructure components that banks should and will adopt. But it’s not totally clear where this adoption could go from here, as SWIFT’s use of CCIP simply gives an intermediary a new capability in the form of blockchain. It’s widely acknowledged that blockchain technology has the potential to significantly enhance the financial industry’s efficiency by diminishing its reliance on intermediaries. But this current practicality is hindered by the intricate nature of reforming a deeply entrenched, centuries-old system. Rather than pursuing an immediate overhaul, the emphasis should instead shift towards making gradual strides in reducing dependence on these financial intermediaries. The path to replacing intermediaries with blockchain technology necessitates the development of use cases, along with achieving interoperability among various blockchains and traditional banking systems. This requires not only demonstrating the blockchain’s technological benefits — notably its security and cost-effectiveness — in an enterprise setting, but also facilitating interoperability between dozens of unconnected blockchain networks. As siloes of data by design, blockchains are unable to share data or transfer assets among each other. Common mechanisms to boost blockchain interoperability including bridges, sidechains and cross-chain platforms all come with their fair share of complexities, security vulnerabilities and potential compliance challenges. Ensuring limited interoperability and relying on susceptible smart contracts to link diverse blockchain networks pose significant barriers to embracing the technology for financial transactions. The prospect of all financial institutions unanimously adopting the same blockchain network seems unlikely, given the decades-long history of technological infrastructure adoption. Consequently, the necessity for intermediaries, exemplified by the establishment of SWIFT for facilitating cross-bank transactions, becomes evident. But that means the fintech industry, which sits squarely between the finance and blockchain worlds, must develop solutions and protocols to link these isolated data silos. A SWIFT report from August 2023 stated that “firms prefer to leverage their existing infrastructure, manage implementations and proven business processes to connect to blockchain ledgers, where tokens are recorded in a way that is both compliant and secure.” Since financial institutions, understandably, don’t want to abandon their existing infrastructure, the key is to integrate new technologies between systems that use various blockchains. Efficient, loosely coupled integrations among entities and the establishment of a “trusted network” to facilitate the secure exchange of value and data can enable institutions to engage in affordable and convenient transfers. Atomic-swap transactions play a significant role in ensuring that transactions occur smoothly and without errors, especially when dealing with different blockchains and older legacy systems. They help maintain consistency and reliability throughout the transaction lifecycle. Moreover, they also contribute to enhancing overall asset transfer security, especially against threats like unauthorized access attempts and manipulation of data. They do this by establishing a secure communication network that supports essential operations like authentication and encryption. This means that the information and transactions within the system are better protected from potential risks. It’s unlikely that SWIFT’s dominance over the transfer of financial information and messages will be broken soon, but its research into interoperable blockchains and tokenization provides major hope toward reducing the inefficiencies caused by intermediaries — such as delays in transactions, additional costs and fees, dependency risks, lack of transparency and compliance challenges. Recognizing SWIFT as a legitimate and necessary financial institution while building the necessary infrastructure to do what it does but more efficiently, affordably and securely provides the best short-term path toward a future free from middlemen. Regardless of what comes from SWIFT’s experiments with blockchain, institutional adoption of blockchain technology will continue to grow as 97% of institutional investors believe tokenization will revolutionize asset management. Meeting this demand and bridging these two disconnected ecosystems can only be done through interoperability and automation, which can do what intermediaries do but cheaper and faster.

25::https://coinatory.com/cryptocurrency-news/worldcoin-foundation-unveils-new-open-source-biometric-security-system-19081/::Coinatory::article::Worldcoin Foundation Unveils New Open-Source Biometric Security System::Explore how Worldcoin Foundation is setting new benchmarks in data security with its innovative open-source biometric system, designed to enhance protection and address global regulatory concerns.::The Worldcoin Foundation has recently launched an innovative open-source system, aimed at bolstering the security of sensitive data, including biometric information. This strategic initiative emerges at a time when digital security is under intense scrutiny, particularly concerning the handling of personal and biometric data. The newly introduced system is designed to enhance data security through the use of Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC), a method that protects data by dispersing it across multiple locations. Hosted on Github, this system exemplifies the Foundation’s commitment to transparency and community-driven development. As detailed in the Foundation’s blog, this advanced SMPC technology splits a single secret into several parts, distributing these amongst various stakeholders to fortify protection. This method is particularly crucial for safeguarding biometric data collected during user registration for the Worldcoin (WLD) project through Orb devices. These devices, pivotal in the registration process, perform iris scanning to verify identities and facilitate the distribution of WLD tokens. In a significant move towards enhanced data privacy, the Worldcoin Foundation has also transitioned to this new system, simultaneously erasing old iris codes that were accumulated previously. This step not only elevates the standard of data protection but also aligns with global best practices amidst growing regulatory scrutiny over data collection methods. The collaboration with TACEO and Tools for Humanity has been instrumental in overcoming the scalability and cost barriers associated with SMPC technology. Tools for Humanity, co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, has been at the forefront of developing this project, taking significant measures to alleviate concerns surrounding its data handling practices. This development is timely as demands for biometric verification are increasing across various sectors. With its new system, the Worldcoin Foundation is leading the way in setting higher standards for data security and addressing the critical needs of digital identity verification in today’s interconnected world. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

26::https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-etf-daily-inflows/::Crypto Briefing::article::Bitcoin ETF snapshot: Grayscale Bitcoin Trust records new gains, Fidelity leads daily Bitcoin ETF inflows::Fidelity's Bitcoin ETF led with $99 million in today's inflows.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article In Monday’s trading session, Grayscale’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), saw $3.9 million in net inflows, according to data from Farside Investors. Leading the charge, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) reported substantial inflows of around $99 million, surpassing BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which saw inflows of around $21.5 million. This is not the first instance of Fidelity outperforming BlackRock in daily Bitcoin ETF inflows. The most significant difference was observed last Friday, with FBTC’s inflows exceeding $102 million compared to IBIT’s $13 million. But the spotlight is on GBTC. Last Friday, for the first time since conversion, the fund attracted $63 million in inflows, ending its prolonged outflow streak. Despite the influx, Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, expressed skepticism regarding its sustainability. “It’s difficult to discern what might be behind the flows into GBTC,” Geraci commented. “ETF buyers are an extremely diverse group with varying motivations. That said, I would be surprised if the inflows become a trend.” The high fee of 1.5% charged by GBTC has been cited as a reason for the fund’s asset outflow. The rate is notably higher than its ten competitors in the US market. Additionally, the liquidation of holdings by bankrupt lender Genesis has contributed to the decline in GBTC’s assets. Nevertheless, Grayscale maintains the lead in assets under management within the category, with GBTC managing approximately $17.4 billion, while IBIT is a close second at about $15.4 billion. Overall, US spot Bitcoin ETFs enjoyed a day of net inflows, totaling $217 million. Despite the positive movement in spot Bitcoin ETFs, Bitcoin’s price did not exhibit a corresponding increase. Historically, Bitcoin prices have risen with significant ETF inflows. However, at the time of reporting, Bitcoin’s price hovered around $63,400, showing a 1.5% decrease over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko.

27::https://theconversation.com/blockchain-based-property-registries-may-help-lift-poor-people-out-of-poverty-98796::The Conversation::article::Blockchain-based property registries may help lift poor people out of poverty::Without secure records of property ownership, many poor people around the world have trouble improving their economic situations. Several countries are already trying blockchain-based land registries.::Many developing countries don’t have a working system of tracking property rights, and what they do have can be fragile and incomplete. In Haiti, for instance, a large earthquake in 2010 destroyed all the municipal buildings that stored documents confirming many small farmers’ ownership of the land they worked. Even years later, many farmers didn’t have proof that they were landowners. People are still fighting over their land. This sort of problem – caused by natural disasters or not – is widespread, causing financial hardship for families in the developing world. Without an official, enforceable legal title to their property, people can’t resolve disputes over who can use which land for what – like who can farm where. They also can’t borrow against their existing assets to invest in their homes, businesses or communities. The value of those properties, and the lost economic opportunities for owners of assets without formal documentation, has been estimated at US$20 trillion worldwide. From researching blockchains and cryptocurrencies for the past three years, I have become convinced that these technologies have the potential to fight root causes of poverty – including by securely recording property ownership. I’m far from alone: Blockchain-based land registries have started up in Bermuda, Brazil, Georgia, Ghana, Honduras, India, Russia and Rwanda. The problems these efforts are addressing are significant. Across the world, land registries are inefficient and unreliable – or even downright corrupt. In Honduras, some government officials altered the country’s land ownership database, stealing property for themselves – including beachfront getaways. In many African countries, more than 90 percent of rural land is not registered. In Ghana, 78 percent of land is unregistered, and the country’s courts have a long backlog of land dispute cases. In India, millions of rural families lack legal ownership of the land they live and work on. The lack of secure land ownership is a bigger cause of poverty in the country than the caste system or a high illiteracy rate. Brazil has no single centralized land registry. Instead, about 3,400 private agents – called “cartorios” – register and check land ownership. The system is confusing, with many different documents created in different historical periods. Most land documents lack specific geographic references on property boundaries. Little wonder, then, that the system is plagued by corruption and double allocations – two formal documents each saying someone else owns a piece of land. These fragile and incomplete property rights systems in the developing world can affect the entire planet. In Brazil’s Amazon rainforest, illicit land grabbers forge deeds and use violence and bribery to falsely claim ownership of property, often under fake names, which the locals call “fantasmas,” or “ghosts.” Then they clear-cut the rainforest, which has serious environmental effects. Having “improved” the land by converting it to pasture, these land thieves then are eligible to register as the formal owners of the land they stole. This cycle has repeated for years, contributing to widespread Amazon deforestation. Using a blockchain system to record transactions could help solve these problems. A blockchain is a secure database that’s stored in a distributed – but connected – set of computers around the internet. It’s not susceptible to tampering, and every addition to the database must be digitally signed, making clear who’s changing what and when. So instead of a system with multiple conflicting documents, some of which may have been forged or altered, there’s only one record with a clear history of modifications, including who did what when. Blockchain transactions can include all kinds of information, including geographic boundaries or serial numbers and an owner’s identity. In Ghana, for instance, the nonprofit Bitland runs a blockchain-based land registry system with a written description of each parcel of land as well as GPS coordinates of boundary points and satellite photos of the area. A collaboration between a U.S.-based blockchain startup and a Brazilian real estate registry has created a record-keeping system for land in the southern coastal municipalities of Pelotas and Morro Redondo. Its blockchain database contains details like the property’s address, the owner’s name and contact information, zoning rules and a unique identification number for the property itself. Blockchain can provide other advantages too. For instance, when transferring land in the republic of Georgia, the buyer and the seller go to a public registry house and pay a fee between $50 and $200. Moving this process onto a blockchain could drop the costs to no more than 10 cents. Just starting a blockchain-based database isn’t enough to solve these problems, though. Data must be accurate when it’s entered, and records must include enough information to be authoritative about the properties they’re referring to. A new technological system won’t fix much in countries where it’s hard to determine the legitimate owner in the first place. Also, bureaucrats may object to new record-keeping systems that reduce their power, status and privileges. However, in places where governments or others who create the systems are viewed as fair and impartial and run a transparent process, blockchain-based land registry systems could give many of the world’s poorest people their first real asset. Once they have straightened out complex, corrupt and contradictory registry systems, people can safely invest in, borrow against and truly improve their properties, helping lift themselves out of poverty.::2018-06-28T10:36:30Z::Blockchain, Developing countries, Developing world, Emerging and developing markets, Global perspectives, Land ownership right, Land tenure, Property law, Property rights, Solutions Journalism::Nir Kshetri::Home::https://images.theconversation.com/files/224994/original/file-20180626-112607-lzp8td.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C828%2C5588%2C2794&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

And $48 Trillion in Wealth Just Got Access::The ETF-led bitcoin rally has stalled over the past three weeks, at least in part thanks to economic indicators pointing to higher than expected interest rates.::The U.S. jobs market continues to exhibit strength with the government reporting the addition of 303,000 jobs last month. That's the strongest headline number since May 2023 and easily topped economist forecasts for 200,000 and February's 270,000 additions (revised from a previously reported 275,000). The unemployment rate in March dipped to 3.8% against expectations for 3.9% and February's 3.9%. The price of bitcoin (BTC) fell about 0.5% in the minutes following Friday morning's report to $66,000. In traditional markets, U.S. stock index futures gave up a chunk of earlier gains, but are still modestly higher. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose 6.5 basis points to 4.38% and the dollar index added 0.5%. Coming into 2024, markets had priced in as many as five or six U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts to begin as soon as March. The economic data, however, hasn't cooperated. Inflation has actually risen somewhat in the first quarter of the year and job growth has remained robust. March has obviously come and gone with no rate cut and traders ahead of today's numbers had moved expectations of the first rate cut to June or July, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. A total of just three rate cuts are expected for the full year and even that could be too much. Speaking yesterday, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari suggested the possibility of no rate cuts at all in 2024. His remarks prompted a sharp reversal in stocks, with the major averages closing down more than 1%. Just following today's numbers, swaps trading indicated expectations for the first rate cut had moved out to September. Checking other report details, the labor force participation rate rose to 62.7% from 62.5%, suggesting sizable numbers of people returning to the workforce. Average hourly earnings rose 0.3% in March, in line with expectations and up from 0.2% in February. On a year-over-year basis, average hourly earnings rose an in line 4.1%, down from 4.3% in February.

As the market condition started to get exciting with several cryptos registering green, Cardano [ADA] also didn’t disappoint. In fact, ADA bulls entered the market as the token’s price broke above a critical resistance zone, hinting at a massive bull rally ahead. CoinMarketCap’s data revealed that Cardano’s price had increased by more than 8% in the last seven days, as it gained bullish momentum on the 15th of May.  At the time of writing, the token was trading at $0.4848 with a market capitalization of over $17.29 billion, making it the 10th largest crypto. However, the recent price pump wasn’t enough to allow the majority of ADA investors to earn profits. As per our look at IntoTheBlock’s data, over 58% of ADA investors were out of money. But this scenario might change soon as ADA broke above a bullish pattern. World of Charts, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet highlighting that ADA’s price broke above a bullish flag pattern that formed on its 8-hour chart. As per the tweet, ADA was almost running on 10% profit, and the pump could allow the token’s price to surge by 100%. If that happens, then investors might witness Cardano touching $1 in the coming weeks. The $1 target might be pretty ambitious in the short term. Therefore, AMBCrypto assessed ADA’s metrics to find where it is headed this week. As per our analysis of Santiment’s data, ADA’s MVRV ratio improved, which can be inferred as a bullish indicator. Its trading volume also remained high while its price surged, acting as a foundation for the bull rally. However, Cardano’s velocity dropped last week. This meant that ADA was used less often in transactions within a set timeframe. Source: Santiment Most market indicators also hinted at a continued price uptick. For instance, ADA’s price remained above its 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). The MACD displayed a clear bullish advantage in the market. On top of that, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) registered a sharp uptick, indicating a further price hike. Source: TradingView Read Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction 2024-25 We then checked Hyblock Capital’s data to look for the target that ADA might reach by the end of this week. Our analysis revealed that Cardano would witness a massive hike in liquidation near the $0.492 mark. Since high liquidations often result in price corrections, ADA’s might hit that level before slowing down for a bit. However, if it manages to break above that, then its price might touch $0.5 or $0.528 this week.

To learn more on how we evaluate each piece of content, please proceed to our verification methodology page One of the dominant narratives in crypto in 2024 is around ETFs. But why do they matter, and what’s the significance of Hong Kong’s involvement? Find the answers to this and more in this Hong Kong spot crypto ETF deep dive. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are baskets of investments that are designed to mimic the performance of an index or sector. They are similar to mutual funds because they pool investors’ assets and use professional fund managers to invest the money. ETFs are bought and sold on an exchange like any other listed stock. ETFs can hold a variety of asset types, including: ETFs are typically considered low-risk investments because they are low-cost and hold a basket of securities or other assets, which is great for diversification. They also attempt to replicate the performance of a specific market. As a result, many ETFs own the same assets as the index they track. Institutional investors can create additional ETF shares or redeem them for a basket of the underlying assets. This procedure helps to match the ETF’s market price with its net asset value (NAV). If an ETF’s price differs from its NAV, traders can buy or sell the ETF while simultaneously holding opposing positions in the underlying assets or a linked derivative (e.g., futures or options). This arbitrage can help bridge the price gap, ensuring the ETF price closely reflects its intended index. It also enables traders to profit from market inefficiencies. Lastly, in the context of cryptocurrency and Bitcoin ETFs, ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin and crypto without the risk of actually holding the asset. ETF fund managers are subject to rigorous regulations on the custody of the underlying assets. Therefore, they are required to appoint a custodian to hold their underlying assets. The custodian is usually a reputable bank or financial institution. Did you know? Coinbase Custody secures the majority of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. Recently, three fund managers have launched six crypto ETFs in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong branches of mainland Chinese firms Harvest Global Investments, China Asset Management (CAM), and Bosera Asset Management issued the Bitcoin and Ether ETF funds. This move marks a significant development in Bitcoin and Hong Kong’s financial markets. Here’s why Hong Kong spot crypto ETFs matter to the crypto ecosystem. Many traders believed that due to a slew of converging events, with the Hong Kong ETFs being the culmination, the price of Bitcoin would pump tremendously on news of the approval. The start of this chain of events began in Q1 2024 when the U.S. Federal Reserve announced interest rate pauses and potential cuts. We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle and that if the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year. This is traditionally viewed as a bullish event by investors. In other words, many believe that when the U.S. Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, the prices of assets like Bitcoin or equities increase, which is good for investors worldwide. Additionally, with the debut of the U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs (another bullish event for Bitcoin), followed by the Bitcoin halving, prospects were generally optimistic regarding the positive performance of Bitcoin. In summary, many anticipated that the price of Bitcoin would pump because of: In fact, the price impact on BTC was much more tepid than many expected, with trading volumes initially looking lower than was anticipated. The leading crypto asset managed to reclaim $64,000 upon the news of Hong Kong spot ETF approval but has since dipped below $60,000 (accurate as of May. 3, 2024). Much hype around Hong Kong ETFs also centers around their proximity to Asian markets, particularly China — where cryptocurrency was banned in 2017. Note: Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region (SAR) sitting just on the border of China. It has its own judicial, legislative, and executive powers and a separate legal system. With a massive population of 1.4 billion (17.72% of the world’s population) and a transaction volume of $90 billion in just a single month in 2023 on Binance from Chinese traders, Hong Kong ETF inflows from mainland China could prove to be a significant value-add to Bitcoin’s performance. In total, Asia-based customer exchange volume exceeded 1 trillion dollars in March and April of 2024. Although this may not necessarily translate to ETF trading, it does make a significant case for Asia’s growing interest in crypto. As stated previously, Asia-based exchange crypto trading volume exceeded $1 trillion in late Q1 2024 and early Q2 2024. This overshadows North American markets, which sit between $100-$200 billion in monthly trading volume. As a result, many people believe Hong Kong ETFs will be serious competitors to U.S. markets. This comparison has much to do with the sentiments of how both markets view crypto. While Hong Kong is positioning itself to become a crypto hub, the U.S. has taken the opposite approach, levying a heavy-handed and oftentimes criticized enforcement towards crypto-related activities, businesses, and developers. Notably, the U.S. approved futures-based crypto ETFs before, and at the chagrin, of approving spot-based crypto ETFs. Many believe spot-based ETFs to be superior products to futures ETFs. This is due to roll costs and contango risks. As a result, the U.S. has been criticized for inadvertently putting customers at risk, while Hong Kong has been praised for its progressive policies towards crypto-based financial products. Moreover, while U.S. crypto ETFs have been relegated to cash redemptions, Hong Kong has opted to use in-kind redemptions, which are considered less complex and more cost-efficient than the latter. Despite the hype, the debut of Hong Kong crypto ETFs was relatively lukewarm. The U.S. ETFs achieved $4.6 billion in trading volume on their first day, while Hong Kong produced about $12 million in trading volume. However, this performance is more impressive when contextualized within the regional markets. https://t.co/CCZxCxVbeh Unlike the U.S., where daily trading volumes can reach $166 billion, Asia sees an average of only $20 billion. Specifically, the ChinaAMC Bitcoin ETF’s first-day intake of $123 million is impressive, ranking it 6th among the 82 ETFs launched in Hong Kong over the past three years. We just put out note with final data (which doesn't come in as fast as US). In short, HK saw $292m in assets on Day One (we predicted $1b in two years so way ahead of schedule but corrections can derail trajectories as we seeing in US). Ether ETFs grabbed 15% of pie and size… https://t.co/RT8SvMvEuA The U.S. Bitcoin ETF’s assets under management (AUM) reflect the United States’s status as the world’s financial center and may also reflect a preference for investors to trade ETFs in the U.S. rather than Hong Kong. As of May 3, 2024, the AUM of U.S. crypto ETFs is between $500 million and about $2.5 billion. On the one hand, the U.S. signifies a larger market for institutional players to trade. On the other, Hong Kong presents a more progressive haven for crypto investors. As of 2024, the U.S. has only approved Bitcoin ETFs, while Hong Kong has both Bitcoin and Ether ETFs. Although Asia dominates crypto trading volume, North America dominates ETF trading volume. Comparatively, the ETF markets in the U.S. and Hong Kong also differ in size, variety of offerings, trading behavior, and regulatory frameworks. With almost $50 billion in assets, Hong Kong has a comparatively small market size. Hong Kong’s ETF market has grown but is still smaller than the U.S. Moreover, ETF offerings in Hong Kong have traditionally focused more on Asian markets and specific regional investments. Everyone is saying the Hong Kong #Bitcoin ETFs flamed out, without understanding what actually happened and what the implications are. This is a second major portal to legacy money. A lot of it. Plan accordingly. https://t.co/Wsme7EPiU5 The U.S. ETF market is one of the largest in the world, with assets totaling almost $9 trillion. It offers a wide variety of ETFs, including those covering: Yes, also @EthereanMaximus: There are more assets in US Listed #Bitcoin ETFs than there are assets in EVERY single ETF listed in Hong Kong. Yes it could be a big deal down the line. But its a whole different animal. The US ETF Market is almost $9 Trillion in assets — that's… U.S. ETFs are also known for having a high degree of innovation. The U.S. market features a broad array of ETFs, including thematic ETFs, ESG (environmental, social, and governance) focused ETFs, leveraged and inverse ETFs, and more. In contrast, the focus in Hong Kong has traditionally been more on conventional assets and less on alternative or niche markets. However, recent years have seen an expansion into more specialized products, including those targeting mainland Chinese investors — although mainland China is currently restricted from trading Hong Kong Bitcoin and Ether ETFs. 2024 will go down as the year of crypto ETFs. Many countries are opening up to the idea of crypto-related financial products being a viable investment strategy. The U.S. kicked off the year by approving spot Bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 10, 2024. Despite historical skepticism towards cryptocurrencies, the approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. in January reflects a commendable shift towards embracing innovation. Following the U.S., Hong Kong was next in line to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs for trading. By the end of 2024, the ASX stock exchange in Australia is anticipated to list the first batch of spot bitcoin ETFs that have been approved. Although Australian investors have traded spot bitcoin ETFs on CBOE Australia since 2022, ASX is Australia’s leading equities exchange, handling most domestic trades. In March 2024. the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) of the U.K. announced that it would not object to requests for crypto asset-backed exchange-traded notes. Shortly thereafter, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) disclosed that it would accept applications for crypto ETNs, with a tentative listing date set for May 28, 2024, and only for institutional investors. Although the U.K. listing is a big win for crypto-related financial products, it is important to recognize the distinction between crypto ETFs vs. ETNs and how they differ from North American and Asian markets. European regulations, particularly those under UCITS, require investment funds to be diversified to reduce risk. ETFs can hold a variety of assets to achieve this diversification. However, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether are single assets, so creating a diversified fund solely focused on a single crypto asset is impossible within the UCITS framework. As a result, financial institutions have turned to alternative structures like Exchange-Traded Notes (ETNs) to provide exposure to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. ETNs are debt securities that track the performance of an underlying asset. In this way they are similar to ETFs, except ETNs do not require direct asset ownership. However, LSE-approved crypto ETNs are required to hold the underlying asset, unlike typical ETNs. The year 2024 is shaping up to be one of the most prolific for crypto developments, particularly in the area of institutional adoption. Whereas in previous cycles, success was characterized by massive startup valuations, froth, and huge profits, this cycle is categorized by a shift towards legitimacy and validation, as major players in finance embrace digital assets. The significance of Hong Kong spot crypto ETFs is most clearly that they are another step towards global recognition and integration of digital assets into traditional financial systems. Yes, on April 30, 2024, Hong Kong investors began trading six Bitcoin and Ether spot ETFs. They were sponsored by three prominent institutions from mainland China, Harvest Global Investments, China Asset Management (CAM), and Bosera Asset Management. Hong Kong has historically positioned itself as a hub for cryptocurrency. China banned cryptocurrency trading in 2021. The nation has a history of imposing bans and restrictions on cryptocurrencies. Although, at times China has reversed its policies, it has yet to change its latest ban. Exchange-traded funds are investment funds, traded on stock exchanges, mirroring the performance of an underlying index or asset. Likewise, exchange-traded notes are debt securities issued by financial institutions that track the performance of an underlying asset or index. The difference between the two is that ETFs typically hold the underlying asset, ETNs normally do not, but also typically expose investors to credit risk. There are many reasons why some would view Hong Kong ETFs as an important event. Many people hypothesized that the debut of Hong Kong ETFs, which followed the Bitcoin halving, would cause the price of Bitcoin to pump. Additionally, the ETFs could be viewed as a sign of mainstream adoption.

31::https://blockworks.co/news/blockchain-lost-decentralized-spirit::Blockworks::article::Blockchain has lost its decentralized spirit::Opinion: I often hear, “We will start out centralized, and we will become more decentralized later” — but this is nonsense!::Decentralization must be the cornerstone, not a mere aspiration, of blockchain’s journey Midjourney modified by Blockworks A narrative has taken root in the realm of blockchain technology, one that champions the gradual transition from centralized control to a decentralized future. Yet this story, often recited by those at the helm, overlooks a fundamental truth about power: Once seized, it is rarely surrendered without a struggle. This belief that a centralized beginning can smoothly transition to a decentralized ethos is more myth than reality, akin to convincing a child to relinquish their tight grasp on a coveted sweet. The intention here isn’t to cast venture capitalists or early stakeholders as adversaries — it’s to advocate for a balance, for fairness that underpins the very foundation of blockchain. I often hear, “We will start out centralized, and we will become more decentralized later.” But I believe this is nonsense! One of the hardest things to give up is power. This notion is vividly illustrated by the French Revolution, a historical event that epitomizes the struggle to redistribute power from an entrenched monarchy to a democratic governance structure. Despite the promise of liberty, equality and fraternity, the revolution faced immense resistance from those unwilling to cede control, leading to a turbulent period of conflict and transformation. This historical episode serves as a poignant reminder that once power is acquired, relinquishing it is a far more formidable challenge than many anticipate. As blockchain ventures flourish, the grip of those in control tightens, with early investors and builders basking in the success their influence has wrought. Conversely, during tumultuous times, these same figures embark on campaigns of reassurance, painting over cracks while strategically planning their exits. This stark duality reveals a profound flaw in the prevalent “centralize now, decentralize later” mantra, significantly underestimating the seductive allure of power and the inherent challenges in relinquishing it once established. The promise of distributed authority is at the heart of the blockchain revolution. The reimagining of governance where innovation serves not just the circulation of capital, but empowers and amplifies a multitude of voices (not just those traditionally heard in the corridors of wealth). Yet, a troubling reality overshadows this ideal: A staggering concentration of over 80% of blockchain assets in the hands of a mere 1% of wallets. Regardless of whether these assets make up projects that aim to fully decentralize or not, the fact of the matter is that early stakeholders and VCs often hold the largest piece of the pie for new blockchains simply because they come in first, when it’s riskiest. This imbalance transcends mere issues of fairness, striking at the very viability of blockchains as engines of innovation and inclusivity. It’s a travesty that the vast majority of value creation does not come from this 1%, underscoring a critical disconnect. Those who contribute the most to the ecosystem often have the least say in its direction and the smallest share in its success — those early VCs holding all the tokens do provide impact with their initial investments, but their participation usually stops there. And because the protocol’s governance is based on the ownership of the token, the new builders don’t have the weight to make major decisions by the major token holders. Read more from our opinion section: The worst kind of decentralization is none at all This stark discrepancy isn’t just unfair; it’s fundamentally counterproductive, eroding the incentive for innovators, developers and community members to pour their energy and creativity into the ecosystem. By sidelining the very individuals who are the lifeblood of innovation, blockchain ecosystems risk stagnating, as the centralized accumulation of benefits stifles the diverse input and collaboration essential for breakthroughs and resilience. Such a structure threatens the long-term sustainability and incentive for valuable contributors to remain engaged and invested in these projects. The long-term viability of blockchain technology depends on its ability to foster a genuinely inclusive environment where contributions are recognized and rewarded appropriately, ensuring that all participants have a stake in the ecosystem’s success. Where do we go from here? I believe that many of the first-generation blockchains, the foundational layers that have been the bedrock of the industry, have veered too far off course. Their structures have solidified around centralization to a point where a return to true decentralization might no longer be feasible. This isn’t to say they’re doomed for failure; far from it. The potential of blockchain technology is vast, its future inherently multichain, promising a landscape rich with diverse and interconnected networks. However, we need to start afresh if we want to harness this potential fully. This proposition might seem daunting, yet considering the broader timeline of technological evolution, we’re still in the nascent stages of blockchain development. The beauty of this space is its foundation in open source principles. Almost all blockchain technologies are open to being studied, modified and repurposed. This openness paves the way for new projects to emerge — i.e, reboots of existing chains, each carrying a distinct mission and fostering a unique culture. Embarking on this path isn’t merely about technological innovation; it’s about reimagining the ethos that guides blockchain development. By initiating new projects with decentralization as a core principle, we stand a chance to correct the course. This approach doesn’t merely replicate what came before, but builds upon it, learning from past missteps to create blockchains that are truly from the people, by the people and for the people. To visualize the potential paths of blockchain, consider two atomic reactions: fusion and fission. A blockchain driven by a diverse, invested community is akin to a fusion reactor. It’s efficient, sustainable and produces a continuous outflow of energy. This model represents a decentralized ecosystem where power and rewards are evenly spread, fostering innovation and participation from all stakeholders. The result is a robust and vibrant network, capable of long-term growth and adaptation. In contrast, a network dominated by a few mirrors the principles of a fission bomb: initially powerful, but ultimately leading to destruction. This reflects a centralized blockchain ecosystem, where concentrated power leads to rapid gains that are not sustainable over time. Such a structure can stifle innovation and lead to a fragile system, prone to collapse. This analogy underlines the crucial choice blockchain faces between sustainable growth and short-term gains, emphasizing the need for a decentralized approach to ensure the technology’s long-term viability and success. Decentralization must be the cornerstone, not a mere aspiration, of blockchain’s journey. It’s about democratizing power, fostering a community where everyone’s voice matters and every contribution is valued from the outset. At this pivotal juncture, the trajectory of blockchain hinges on our resolve to anchor it in decentralization from the very beginning. By prioritizing decentralization as our foundational principle, we chart a course toward a future where blockchain serves as a bedrock for equitable growth and democratic engagement. Let’s seize this opportunity to redefine the landscape, ensuring blockchain remains a tool for empowering the many, not just the few. In doing so, we not only realize the full potential of blockchain technology but also contribute to the creation of a fairer, more inclusive world. This is not just the path to technological innovation, but a step towards a more equitable and collaborative ecosystem. We are still early.

This surge in capital allocation aligns closely with a key uptick in Bitcoin’s value, affirming investor confidence in the cryptocurrency sector. Farside Investors reports that overall, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs saw $100.5 million in net inflows on May 14, indicating a robust week of investment activity. Conversely, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) experienced a net outflow of $50.9 million, contrasting sharply with the inflows seen in other funds. Notably, the ARKB ETF has consistently attracted substantial capital, with inflows surpassing the $100 million mark seven times previously. The fund reached its peak with a record $200.7 million inflow on March 27, and its most considerable outflow of $98.1 million occurred shortly afterward on May 1. Other funds like BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) have not mirrored this trend, with no new inflows for two consecutive days. Meanwhile, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) added $8.1 million in net inflows, bolstered by a strong performance the previous day with $38.6 million, leading the U.S. BTC ETF market. Additional smaller-scale inflows were noted in ETFs such as BTCO, EZBC, BRRR, and HODL, which reported $5.5 million, $1.8 million, $1.2 million, and $1.7 million respectively. The cumulative net inflows into the BTC ETF market are nearing a milestone, approaching $12 billion, currently standing at $11.84 billion. This growth trajectory coincides with Bitcoin’s recent price increase, which saw a 0.5% rise over the past 24 hours, with the cryptocurrency trading at $62,150. This data not only highlights the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency investment landscape but also signals a continued investor interest amid fluctuating market conditions. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

33::https://cryptobriefing.com/roaring-kitty-gme-comeback/::Crypto Briefing::article::Legendary trader Roaring Kitty posts comeback meme, Solana meme coin $GME soars 500%::Roaring Kitty has not posted anything on social media in three years.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Keith Gill, also known online as Roaring Kitty (also known by other pseudonyms such as DeepF*ckingValue), has posted a cryptic meme on X. Notably, this was Gill’s first post in roughly three years since the events surrounding the GameStop case and the shutdown of the WallStreetBets subreddit. pic.twitter.com/YgjVqtgcNS — Roaring Kitty (@TheRoaringKitty) May 13, 2024 The meme depicts a man leaning forward from a sitting position while holding what appears to be a smartphone. Notably, the meme has a red chair and a red arrow going right, indicating some sort of movement or directional change. Gill is largely credited for spiking the GameStop stock surge in late 2020. Gill worked as a financial analyst, became convinced that GameStop stock was undervalued and shared this belief on Twitter (now X) and YouTube using the handle RoaringKitty. In 2019, Gill purchased $53,000 worth of GameStop stock. As he continued posting about the stock on social media, more retail traders (everyday people who trade stocks) began buying GameStop, leading to a rapid rise in the stock price. When GameStop’s stock price peaked at $483 per share in January 2021, Gill’s investment was valued at nearly $48 million. Gill’s identity was revealed shortly after the GameStop stock surge by Reuters who identified him using public records. In February 2021, Gill testified to Congress about his role in the GameStop stock saga, stating that he thought the stock was “dramatically undervalued.” In September 2022 and 2023, Netflix and Sony Pictures released a docuseries and a movie titled “Eat the Rich: The GameStop Saga” and “Dumb Money,” respectively, which spotlighted Gill’s journey. A Solana memecoin ($GME) made to commemorate the events surrounding the GameStop controversy suddenly surged $510.9% just over eight hours since Gill’s X post. “The $GME memecoin pays homage to the GameStop saga anniversary, showing we can stand up to the big guys together,” states the token’s official website. According to data from CoinGecko, the token’s price has been largely inactive since its creation in late January. It remains unclear whether Gill has any connection with the token.

34::https://theconversation.com/after-bitcoin-are-you-ready-for-the-next-generation-of-cryptocurrencies-37927::The Conversation::article::After Bitcoin, are you ready for the next generation of cryptocurrencies?::With the Bank of England mooting the idea it might get involved with digital currencies, you might think it was good news for Bitcoin.::The Bank of England believes that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin could be big news and even UK chancellor George Osborne is tweeting about it. But it is important to note the detail in the central bank’s comments. It is talking about forming its own digital currencies in a trend which could yet see Bitcoin take a back seat in the future it helped to create. At a recent meeting of the Social Media Leadership Forum in London on the theme of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, we watched a short film that portrays Bitcoin as a kind of moral alternative to traditional banks. Not only is Bitcoin the new, cool choice of Generation Z, but it is also a way to render third party profiteering from financial transactions irrelevant. Bitcoin is the answer! Bitcoin is the future. Bitcoin is the best way of transferring value digitally without a third party. No pal needed to pay … There was a straw poll in the audience. Who, of these leaders of (mostly) large corporations in the UK, had any direct experience of Bitcoin? Three hands went up – and they belonged to three young terrier-like Bitcoin entrepreneurs who chatted freely and articulately about their wares and painted the Bitcoin story as a huge, unstoppable business opportunity. Two contrasting views emerged at that meeting. One is of Bitcoin as a kind of moral revolution, setting us free from corporate greed, interference and snooping. The other is a more prosaic view, of Bitcoin as a new means of making money in a leaner and smarter way. (There is also a subsidiary view of course: of a below-the-radar gambling den, a shadow money-changing table for the Dark Web) The unscientific poll in that meeting room would appear to support findings elsewhere. One online survey found that only 8% of US retailers were planning to accept Bitcoin within the next 12 months. None was currently accepting Bitcoin. Another survey found 65% of people polled were not at all familiar with Bitcoin. Of those that were even slightly familiar, 80% had never used it before. There has been a significant decline in the value of bitcoins, and questions have been raised about whether 2015 is Bitcoin’s make or break year. Whatever the prophets of doom say, there remain bullish young entrepreneurs, buoyed by the recent announcement that Dell will be the first major retailer to accept Bitcoin, as well as a survey that suggests lower income populations may well embrace it. The Bank of England is understandably circumspect about the feasibility and advantages of creating its own digital currency, but the simple fact of the discussion adds to the feeling that Bitcoin may be the “first draft” of something with broader application. Digital value doesn’t only have to mean money and the popular view of Bitcoin might just emphasise the “coin” a little too much. At the meeting in London much discussion centred around the “blockchain”. This public ledger of all Bitcoin transactions effectively creates continuity for Bitcoin users, a context in which the currency can exist. According to technology writer Nozomi Hayase: So, let’s say that Bitcoin is a good example of decentralisation and people power, but it is only a first example, and we will move on to using and innovating the underlying technology. It is no longer about cryptocurrencies really but about the potential of third party-free transfer. That can involve entirely different cultural interactions than just seeing value as meaning money. For example, we could see voting and collective decison-making without the use of third-party control. The future can involve all kinds of creative exchange between human (and even digital) beings that are direct, private when wanted, and totally in the hands of sender and receiver. You might enact your will without lawyers. You might even ensure your driverless car isn’t mediated by Google but is just a direct relationship between you and the vehicle’s operating system. We will transfer all kinds of digital value and assets without third party control. Our artistic creations: our music, our digital art. With the advent of drones, even physical things. One of the issues that Bitcoin has is its split personality. It is touted as a place of personal empowerment and direct, honest transacting that is private and yet also potentially seedy and criminal. It is billed as a moral reaction to greedy banks that, at the same time, offers ways to gamble in a money market not dissimilar in terms of underpinning ethics. It suggests freedom from governance even as that very lack of governance may throw up all kinds of social problems. That puts our choice of future at a crossroads. For, even as we cut a direct channel from sender to receiver, between sharers of different kinds of meaning and value, we also potentially cut out the moral force that third parties have usefully played. Most users of Bitcoin are shocked to discover that if they are scammed into sending Bitcoins to a fake web site, their money is gone for good, with no way of getting it back. Currently, there’s redress in the realm of conventional banking. If insurers spring up in the Bitcoin arena with hundred dollar excesses, aren’t we heading back into the realm of third party involvement again anyway? And if central banks start issuing their own digital currencies? Yet the opportunity is there to take Bitcoin away from a collusion of mediocrity around money metaphors and evolve into genuinely new and exciting ways to allow the sharing of value in ways that empower individuals, regardless of income. As Hayase, also points out: “Bitcoin makes possible open source governance. The power to decide the course of one’s own destiny is now in the hands of ordinary people.” That huge claim implies the way crypto-value exchange is viewed and deployed is going to change significantly. Without third party governance, we will have to build ethical awareness and behaviour into new versions of the platform, and also research and educate ourselves in the new moral challenges and risks associated with it. The technology promises much, but the whole thing may end up parked in wiring cash and simply buying and selling more stuff online. Yet it could be so much more. Blockchain technology could underpin the internet of things, safeguarding our privacy, reducing cost, and ensuring the next wave of change in the digital realm puts real control in the hands of people, not corporations. Whether it does will depend not on enthusiastic Bitcoin entrepreneurs, or opportunistic corporations like Dell, but on the users. You and me. And maybe the odd central bank.::2015-02-26T14:46:15Z::Bank of England, Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, Finance, George Osborne::Paul Levy::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/73055/original/image-20150225-1780-1y9qqh7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

The options market shows investors are taking the hint. A death cross occurs when a short-term moving average drops below the long-term moving average, signaling a potential long-term bearish shift in momentum. The ratio's 50-week simple moving average (SMA) appears on track to cross below the 200-week SMA, according to charting platform TradingView. The impending death cross signals risk aversion or prolonged underperformance of ether (ETH) and other altcoins relative to bitcoin (BTC). Since 2017, the crypto market has oscillated between bitcoin-led regimes and altcoin-led regimes. More importantly, altcoin leadership has been characterized by a rising ETH/BTC ratio. In other words, traders are willing to take more risk when ether is outperforming bitcoin and vice versa. The ETH/BTC ratio has dropped nearly 10% to 0.048 this year, TradingView data show . "The ETHBTC cross is testing a critical support level after breaking below 0.05," Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a market note Friday. "There has been a persistent large selling of ETH calls which has crushed [volatility] and also put some downside pressure on price. Could this again be a very early signal of [bullish] FOMO turning into fear in ETH as a proxy for alts." The way bitcoin and ether options are currently priced on Deribit, the leading derivatives exchange, also points to expectations for ether underperformance in the near term. At press time, ether puts expiring in seven days, one and two months traded at premiums of 5%, 3% and 0.3%, respectively, to calls. A put option gives the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. A call option gives the right to buy, so the premium for puts – which provide protection against a price decline – indicates a bearish outlook. In bitcoin's case, the bias was for calls across maturities, excluding seven-day options. Edited by Sheldon Reback.

Bitcoin [BTC], the leading cryptocurrency, is beginning to recover from a week-long slump, currently valued at $67,093 with a 1.28% increase in the past 24 hours. Additionally, on the 17th of May, Farside Investors reported that Grayscale’s spot Bitcoin ETF (GBTC) saw inflows of $31.6 million, and GBTC now oversaw more than $18 billion in assets. Source: Farside Investors Well, Grayscale has faced major challenges since converting from a trust to a spot ETF in January. However, three consecutive days of inflows have been a boon for GBTC.  Seeing a positive outlook of GBTC among investors, an X (formerly Twitter) user, @osf_rekt said, Source: OSF/X This transition has resulted in over $17 billion in withdrawals, largely due to higher fees than other options. Additionally, a series of bankruptcies within the crypto industry over the last two years compelled companies to withdraw funds to meet creditor obligations. Interestingly, on the 15th of May, all spot Bitcoin ETFs, apart from BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), reported inflows. Simultaneously, on a similar day, Grayscale’s GBTC notably recorded its first inflows in a week, drawing in $27 million. This highlights that institutional investors are showing interest in Bitcoin, bringing liquidity, while crypto whales remain less enthusiastic. Data from Santiment, analyzed by AMBCrypto, indicate that while whales slowed accumulation, retail investors are increasing, promoting network decentralization. Source: Santiment This trend of retail accumulation could benefit Bitcoin in the long run by promoting greater network decentralization. Highlighting May’s positivity for spot Bitcoin ETFs, Eric Balchunas, Senior Analyst at Bloomberg, noted, “The bitcoin ETFs have put together a solid two weeks with $1.3b in inflows, which offsets the entirety of the negative flows in April- putting them back around high water mark of +$12.3b net since launch. This key number IMO bc it nets out inflows and outflows (which are normal).” Source: Eric Balchunas/X Offering advice to investors, he further commented, “Last two mos show why best not to get emotional over flows which come in and out, part of ETF life, but a) i think they’ll net out positive long-term b) the flow amts on either side are small relative to aum maybe (1-2%) so it’s never SO OVER or SO BACK if you think about it.”   Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

38::https://blockworks.co/news/what-is-fully-homomorphic-encryption::Blockworks::article::What is fully homomorphic encryption and how will it change blockchain?::Fully homomorphic encryption differs from zero-knowledge tech, as it can compute on top of encrypted data without revealing data points.::FHE differs from zero-knowledge technology, as it can perform computation on top of encrypted data without revealing data points Artwork by Crystal Le In today’s digital world, the need to decrypt data for computational tasks exposes it to security risks. This is a significant problem in privacy-sensitive sectors like Web3, where decentralized applications and finance at times rely on both confidentiality and integrity in data processing to maintain trust and security on chain. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) offers a potential solution by enabling the processing of encrypted data without needing to decrypt it first, thus preserving confidentiality. This advancement not only enhances data security and privacy, but also extends the potential for secure data analysis and decentralized services. Guy Itzhaki, CEO and co-founder of Fhenix, says that in the context of blockchain, FHE enables developers and users to control which assets they want to maintain privately and confidentially on-chain. This means that it will enable developers to “create a new set of use cases,” and “unlock the way for true on-chain gaming, voting, and auctions,” Itzahki said. Read more: Encryption startup Fhenix raises $7M for private computation Although there are some similarities between FHE and zero-knowledge (zk) technology, the major difference is that FHE technology can perform computation on top of encrypted data without having to reveal or know the data points to obtain the end result. Liam McDonald, head of growth at blockchain privacy startup Fairblock, explained that with zk technology, a prover turns necessary data into a secure code called a polynomial commitment to show it’s accurate. “In order to do this, the data itself is turned into polynomial hashes and is aggregated into a polynomial equation of the hashes that represents the encoded data,” McDonald told Blockworks. This equation is then sent to a verifier, who determines whether the function is true. If the function is proven, a proof is generated, confirming that the information inside is accurate. Peyman Momeni, co-founder of Fairblock, mentioned that while zk proofs allow users to validate ownership of data or correct computation, they fall short in supporting computations on encrypted data, especially when it involves merging private information from multiple users. “Zk is more relevant for scalability with some degree of security and limited privacy applications like shielded transfers, where FHE unlocks wide range of applications coupled with higher levels of data security and privacy,” Momeni said. When combined with the benefits of the blockchain, FHE provides enhanced privacy, which is a core component that is missing in the existing blockchain ecosystem, said Kaal Dhairya, a Shiba Inu developer. “Apart from true end-to-end encryption of data, this opens up a variety of use cases, including supply chain/food chain to blockchain, private voting for DAOs, efficient prediction markets, on-chain casino games, hidden items in on-chain games, and many more,” Dhairya said. Momeni notes that in most crypto use cases, it is necessary to combine private inputs from multiple users, compute over them and decrypt the results, meaning that there would be a “shared private state.” “As an example in private governance or sealed-bid auctions, all users encrypt their votes or bids, we perform on-chain computing over encrypted data, then in the end we need to decrypt the actual results,” he said. “In this case we don’t actually decrypt the individual bids/votes/trades, just the updated state or the result of computation.” Read more: Fully homomorphic encryption rollups are one step closer to reality To ensure no single user has exclusive access, a system of multiple validators should share this decryption key, and decrypt the information collaboratively at the appropriate time. According to Momeni, current FHE technologies face the technical hurdle of creating a decentralized system for managing these decryption keys. Fairblock, however, is developing a solution with a decentralized network for key generation, aiming to make FHE technology more accessible and practical for developers and various platforms. It’s worth noting that FHE isn’t the only privacy solution being developed on the blockchain today; there are several other solutions that might be more beneficial for developers building different tools. “There are different solutions with different trade-offs, so we’re trying to enable developers to use them correctly without passing a cryptography course,” Momeni said. Read more from our opinion section: Privacy is going mainstream In the case of Fairblock, the company sees itself as being similar to Axelar, Eigenlayer, or Celestia, where a network facilitates and accelerates other builders. “Instead of cross-chain messaging, shared security, and data availability, we’re abstracting away all of the bandwidth overhead, onboarding and maintenance costs of running the network in a secure and decentralized way,” he said. The company recently rolled out its public testnet, which is designed for developers of select layer-2 networks to tailor how they integrate encryption and decryption into applications. It currently enables users to leverage identity-based encryption (IBE), witness encryption (WE) with integration of fully homomorphic encryption still under development.

Share this article Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands, May 16th, 2024, Chainwire  Today, Netki, a digital identity verification leader, announced the launch of their pioneering compliance oracle – DeFi Sentinel – on Sui, the Layer 1 blockchain and smart contract platform. The integration introduces an essential tool for developers that automates compliance within their protocols, allowing them to focus on shipping high-impact projects instead of spending time developing tools to meet complex, ever-changing regulations that often differ across jurisdictions. Institutions are eager to engage with DeFi protocols and technology but need to ensure that all of their trades, and trading partners, meet their compliance standards. Until now, these institutional players have been forced to either trade in manually managed pools with limited liquidity and trading volume, or to avoid DeFi altogether. With DeFi Sentinel on Sui, developers can meet institutional as well as regulator requirements via a one-time integration. DeFi Sentinel leverages Netki’s advanced technology to provide real-time KYC/AML, wallet screening, financial transaction monitoring, securities compliance, and tax compliance, all now integrated directly within the DeFi protocols on Sui that choose to implement the tool. The solution combines on-chain and off-chain data to ensure each transaction adheres to institutional risk, as well as regulatory standards. Sui will also integrate Netki’s OnboardID, which, for protocols that enable it, enhances user onboarding and identity verification processes, reducing costs and simplifying compliance around the onramping process for Sui developers’ applications. Netki’s integration represents a significant advancement in making decentralized financial systems safer and more accessible globally. “DeFi protocols are poised to transform financial services by enhancing accessibility and transparency, but many of the best ideas fail to get off the ground due to compliance concerns,” said Evan Cheng, CEO of Mysten Labs, the original contributor to Sui. “Netki’s integration not only fortifies the security and compliance of transactions on Sui but also assures institutional and individual participants of their adherence to evolving regulatory requirements, and most importantly, gives developers the peace of mind to build with confidence.” Netki’s DeFi compliance oracle is unique in the industry, enabling transaction-by-transaction compliance, which is crucial for institutional adoption of DeFi tools. With features like real-time name and wallet screening, the solution ensures that compliance and risk management are seamlessly integrated into the transaction flow without compromising the user experience or developer agility. “By integrating DeFi Sentinel with Sui’s robust and scalable blockchain infrastructure, we are setting a new standard for safety and compliance in the DeFi space,” said Justin Newton, CEO of Netki. “We aim to enable the safe and widespread adoption of DeFi technologies, ensuring that developers can focus on innovation while evolving and expanding compliance requirements are effortlessly met.”  Sui Foundation [email protected] Share this article The information on or accessed through this website is obtained from independent sources we believe to be accurate and reliable, but Decentral Media, Inc. makes no representation or warranty as to the timeliness, completeness, or accuracy of any information on or accessed through this website.

As predicted however, 2015 has seen the continued fall in value of the currency that was supposed to fuel the digital age. In the last 10 days alone, it has lost 26% in value. If 2014 was a bad year for the digital currency, 2015 looks like it will be even worse. Barely days into the year, UK-based Bitcoin exchange Bitstamp was “hacked” and 19,000 Bitcoin stolen. At the time, this loss was valued at US $5 million. Bitstamp has since come back online, with revamped security from BitGo. It may however, all be a bit too late. Hacks of Bitcoin exchanges have come to characterise the Bitcoin world. It isn’t something that is necessarily inherent in Bitcoin itself, but more of a feature of the types of companies that have sprung up around the troubled technology. At best, the hack of one-time leading Bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, was a result of sloppy coding and business practices. At worst, it was an inside job, defrauding its customers of $487 million. A more ominous problem has cast its shadow on the future of Bitcoin. Bitcoin relies on people to engage in “mining” to validate every exchange of the virtual currency. Miners, do some agreed calculations, and if they are fast, or lucky, enough, will succeed in winning some newly produced Bitcoin in exchange for adding the transaction onto the Bitcoin ledger called the Blockchain. The strategy of mining has become Bitcoin’s achilles’ heel. The design of Bitcoin dictates that the difficulty of mining will increase as more Bitcoins are produced and more miners get involved. This has led to mining being dominated by companies that can scale to the point where they can guarantee to earn a certain percentage of Bitcoins created each day. As Bitcoin’s value has dropped, the economics of the mining operation have changed, to the point that mining ceases to be economically viable. Cloud mining company CEX.io suspended their mining operations this week, declaring that it needed the price of Bitcoin to be at least $320 before it would be able to resume its operations. Unfortunately for them, the price has dropped even further since and the likelihood of it climbing back to $320 seems slim. Another mining company, CoinTerra, is being sued by a data centre provider for $5.4 million for unpaid fees. The cost of power alone to run CoinTerra’s services was $12,000 a day. The underlying protocol of Bitcoin does allow for the relative difficulty of mining to be eased if it becomes to hard for miners to stay in operation. In fact, this happened last month for the first time since 2012. It could theoretically continue to become easier as the Bitcoin price drops. The issue is however, that this wasn’t supposed to happen. Bitcoin’s price was supposed to keep increasing as more Bitcoins came onto the market. Bitcoins value relies purely on the belief of the people who buy and sell it. There is no central bank or government around to support it in the case of its value crashing to zero. Once that belief is questioned, Bitcoin becomes unsustainable. Even if the price of Bitcoin doesn’t go to zero, the chances the Bitcoin community convincing the wider public, governments, and industry that Bitcoin really represents the future of the world’s digital economy will become extremely unlikely. For the time being, Bitcoin still has enough devotees who believe that the currency will eventually recover and still claim the crown as the future enabler of all digital commerce. However, even they are having their doubts that this grand technological experiment may have run its course.::2015-01-13T14:24:08Z::N/A::David Glance::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/68848/original/image-20150113-28434-1bbzbr4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

Ritual raised $25 million last November to address the centralized nature of AI systems. The investment was led by Archetype and included participation from Accomplice and Robot Ventures. Now Polychain has put a ribbon on the funding round. In an email to CoinDesk, it declined to disclose the exact amount invested. AI has become an area of interest in the blockchain industry following the proliferation of AI-powered tools and their increased mainstream popularity over the last year or so. Blockchain firms are attempting to address concerns that Big Tech giants like Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META) and Alphabet (GOOG) will build an AI oligarchy by introducing decentralization into the storage of data and access to infrastructure. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes joined Ritual's board of advisers in January, referring to the need to "ensure the burgeoning AI economy has access to a more censorship-resistant, collaboration-powering technology than we currently have."

43::https://ambcrypto.com/shiba-inus-q2-price-prediction-will-shib-retest-0-000030/::AMBCrypto::article::Shiba Inu’s Q2 price prediction: Will SHIB retest $0.000030?:: The golden cross suggests potential bullish trend for SHIB. But it also depends on the money and exchange flow.::The golden cross suggests potential bullish trend for SHIB. But it also depends on the money and exchange flow.  Shiba Inu [SHIB] posted an 11.69% increase in the last seven days. However, the token has been struggling to maintain that momentum over the last two days. Irrespective of that, some technical indicators suggest that the price could get back to its rally. One of the signals AMBCrypto observed was the golden cross on the 4-hour SHIB/USD chart. To get a golden cross, traders look at the Exponential Moving Average (EMA). This pattern forms when the shorter EMA crosses above the longer EMA.  At press time, the 20 EMA (blue) had crossed over the 50 EMA (yellow)—A golden cross, indicating a bullish trend. Furthermore, SHIB’s price had not slipped below the 50 EMA, meaning the thesis has not been invalidated. However, the Money Flow Index (MFI) was down to 30.21. This decrease indicates that a lot of capital has flowed out of the SHIB market. In a bearish situation, this could lead the price to $0.000022. However, the MFI might likely hit the oversold point, which could be around 20.00 or below. Should this be the case, the price of the Shiba Inu native token might rebound. Sustaining the golden cross if (when) this happens could take the price higher. Source: TradingView The likely first stop could be $0.000027, after which, SHIB’s value could rise to $0.000030, which was close to the ceiling it hit in March. For this, considering the technical aspect alone might be enough. Hence, AMBCrypto took things from the state of the token on-chain. In doing this, we assessed the exchange inflow and outflow. If the exchange inflow is higher than the outflow, it means that the token involved could face selling pressure, and the value could drop. On the other hand, a higher exchange outflow favors a price increase. As of this writing, SHIB’s exchange outflow was 53.20 billion. The inflow, at the opposite end, was 50.55 billion. Historically, the 3 billion difference between the metrics might not be enough to support a one-directional movement. As such, SHIB’s price might consolidate in the short term. Source: Santiment From our outlook, the price might move between $0.000023 and $0.000025. Going forward, traders might need to keep an eye on the netflow. In a case where the outflow doubles the exchange inflow, then we might see SHIB’s price move upward slowly. If sustained, a breakout to $0.00030 could be achieved. Read Shiba Inu’s [SHIB] Price Prediction 2024-2025 A summary of the analysis suggested that this rise could come to pass before the end of May. However, there is a likelihood that this prediction could be invalidated. Thus, traders might need to watch for changes in the status of Shiba Inu on-chain, and from the technical perspective.

This time, the Ethereum-based restaking platform EigenLayer is acknowledging its users, early adopters, and contributors with a much-anticipated airdrop. In addition to being a promotional event, the EigenLayer airdrop event is also a tested method to decentralized token ownership and encourage participation. But who can claim the tokens, and how does it work? This guide covers everything you need to know about EigenLayer airdrop eligibility and how to claim EigenLayer tokens. EigenLayer allows Ethereum stakers to further the utility of their staked ETH by using it across diverse, decentralized applications and protocols. Like many other platforms relying on blockchain technology, EigenLayer has also resorted to crypto airdrops to drive its strategic objectives. Here is the latest update released by the community: Updates on the EIGEN Stakedrop pic.twitter.com/1cwSForJnx Did you know? EigenLayer prefers to call its airdrops “stake drops,” focusing on increasing liquidity and enhancing the decentralized finance (DeFi) engagement. As mentioned, an airdrop from EigenLayer isn’t just a marketing gimmick. Instead, it comes with the following perks: Qualification for the EigenLayer airdrop depends on a user’s level of interaction with the EigenLayer ecosystem. Also, EigenLayer’s airdrop phases are segregated as Season 1 and Season 2, with Season 1 proceedings underway. Here’s a look at the eligibility (qualification) for Season 1. Firstly, the EigenLayer airdrop eligibility for season 1 is already taken care of via a snapshot that was captured on March 15, 2024. This means any move after this data capture will not result in additional tokens as part of the Season 1 rollout. Eligibility here depended on the extent of a user’s Ethereum restaking — either via staking in EigenLayer or utilizing other DeFi markets like Pendle. Staking via EigenLayer is eligible for 90% of the Season 1 stake drops, also referred to as Phase 1. Phase 2 stands for 10% of the airdrop rollout via Ethereum restaking using platforms other than the EigenLayer platform. Here are other aspects of the Season 1 rollout: Here are some additional details regarding the Phase 1 and Phase 2 of Season 1: Also, you can check the claim status of the Season 1 stake drop while reviewing the terms and conditions: Phase 2 details: The Eigenlayer FAQ docs offer clear information regarding the $EIGEN airdrop: Regarding the allocation process in Phase 2: – The Eigen Foundation communicated to each LRT project the amount of EIGEN reserved for their users. – Each LRT project will provide a list of wallet… pic.twitter.com/hRFg4wEoCE Even though the details of Season 2 are not yet completely clear, we could see another 5% of the allocated 15% as Season 2 stakedrops. Also, the focus of Season 2 will be on long-term engagement and protocol-specific contributions. Also, any kind of protocol interaction that happened after March 15, 2024, will qualify for Season 2. Here are some of the qualification metrics for Season 2: Other qualification details will be revealed by EigenLayer in days to come. Season 1 is done. However, here are the steps to participate in Season 2 of crypto airdrops from EigenLayer. Here is how the points are calculated: So it appears $EIGEN might be launching this week? I've seen pretty strong rumours but nothing is confirmed ofc. I created this sheet a few weeks back which shows the value of EigenLayer points as a function of the airdrop % and $EIGEN FDV Note, this assumes $EIGEN snapshot is… pic.twitter.com/rvcMLiGEfi Once the EigenLayer tokens are released, the entire aspect of DeFi integration will change. Based on what might happen, the airdrop eligibility for Season 2 can be determined via the following strategies: Simply put, EigenLayer might end up giving users free tokens to provide liquidity. Staking providers will also be able to manage and tweak their liquidity stake depending on the performance and health of the pool. Season 1 hasn’t been kind to the DeFi markets: Was just about to post a long rant but you should read the post below instead. Pendle and other EigenLayer DeFi users don't receive only 10% of the airdrop. It seems what they are trying to convey is that only 10% of the points generated in S1 came from these activities.… https://t.co/ZzKVvl5t0U Note: Only the Season 1 airdrop structure was eligible for testnet-based allotment via Goerli testnet. Now that Goerli is deprecated, newer testnet interactions via Holesky are not eligible to receive EigenLayer tokens as airdrops. In addition to the mentioned options, EigenLayer’s airdrop eligibility for Season 2 and other upcoming seasons might also depend on how well users stack up against Sybil attacks. The platform has already implemented strategies to prevent users from creating more than one account to claim multiple tokens. Over time, the robust identity verification process might be implemented throughout the ecosystem, with each instance attracting free tokens as airdrops. Honesty could go a long way in users receiving the EigenLayer airdrops. Before delving deeper into the criticisms, let us take a look at the Season 1 token allotment highlights: Other concerns highlighted: Had 3000 points but they disappeared 24h before claim, was left with 240 points. My manta supply and stake was never taken into account. My Pyth eligibility vanished. Today 0 zero ! It's like Eigen, layer zero, Linea, … don't like these EVM airdrops Here is a detailed explanation highlighting the rationale behind additional tokens, country-specific restrictions, and more: Why EigenLayer Gave Away More Tokens After Widespread Criticism of Its Stakedrop@sreeramkannan and @rjdrost discuss the loved and hated @EigenLayer airdrop and how they responded to community feedback. 💴 The role of EIGEN 🤑 Why they are giving users 100 additional EIGEN… pic.twitter.com/czaoZ1rl2A (Historical Image – 2024 – Colorized) The face of US users who spent 3 months paying 15% yields, loop farming Eigenlayer points on farming protocols, after reading they can't get the airdrop. pic.twitter.com/gvla3DxrBk Based on how things were for Season 1, experts believe the following enhancements will surface across the upcoming airdrop seasons: Season 1 of EigenLayer airdrops clearly mentions that the tokens are non-transferable. This means even after claiming EigenLayer tokens, you cannot simply move them to DEXs and CEXs to offload. Even though this initial restriction was criticized by many, it makes sense when it comes to avoiding rapid sell-offs. Based on how other airdrops in the past have materialized, gradual token releases are expected once Phase 1 and Phase 2 airdrop claims are handled for Season 1. Also, we expect EIGEN tokens to be available on the leading crypto exchanges in time. With the EigenLayer airdrop or any other similar event, navigating the space requires you to be aware of the terms and conditions beforehand. From verifying eligibility to identity, you must cover every required element before proceeding. Furthermore, it is crucial to check and verify EigenLayer airdrop claims using only the official EigenLayer website page. Airdrops present opportunities for scammers, with unscrupulous parties often waiting to prey on unsuspecting users and compromise wallet security. The idea is to remain safe, aware, and prepared, all while having complete control over your custody options. The EigenLayer airdrop signifies the distribution of free EigenLayer tokens to the qualified participants. This move is aimed to kickstart the adoption of the EigenLayer ecosystem and incentivize people interested in staking the already staked Ethereum to secure the diverse fecentralized applications (DApps) and protocols associated with the Ethereum network. Participating in crypto airdrops comes with highly specific requirements. For instance, if you take the EigenLayer airdrop into consideration, staking in EigenLayer is the primary criterion. The more staked Ethereum you push into the EigenLayer ecosystem, regardless of the custody options, the higher your chances of getting airdrops. Yes, EigenLayer has announced or rather unveiled its native EigenLayer token — EIGEN. Meant to facilitate a handful of governance-specific activities, interaction with AVS, and other activities, this native token will make its way into user wallets via airdrops. EIGEN, within the EigenLayer ecosystem, will also help generate staking rewards. In time, it is expected to have DeFi-specific use-cases. EigenLayer airdrop is a way to get more people associated with the ETH 2.0 upgrade vision by incentivizing them to restake. With restaking, it is possible to passively secure a host of DApps and protocols on Ethereum without actively validating them using nodes and networks. Plus, this airdrop brings community involvement into the mix.

45::https://blockworks.co/news/nirvana-alternative-to-google-cloud-aws::Blockworks::article::Nirvana Cloud debuts as blockchain-optimized alternative to AWS and Google Cloud::Nirvana Labs is debuting its Nirvana Cloud computing service meant to work specifically with blockchain workloads.::The startup’s cloud service uses hardware optimized for blockchains Nirvana Labs and Adobe Stock modified by Blockworks Nirvana Labs is debuting its Nirvana Cloud computing service meant to work specifically with blockchain workloads. CEO Dan Burke told Blockworks that the startup raised $1.7 million in pre-seed funding, and counts blockchain platforms like Chainlink and Avalanche as clients. According to Burke, the company is hoping to lure Web3 projects away from more general purpose cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud, which are widely used across many industries, including the crypto space. But Nirvana is not building a decentralized computing platform, a la Golem, nor a decentralized storage solution like IPFS. Rather, it’s taking the centralized status quo and specializing it for Web3. Read more: Researchers use blockchain network to simulate the dawn of life on Earth AWS and Google Cloud provide public cloud services that enable the purchase of resources such as servers and storage via the internet. This arrangement is often cost-effective, as it eliminates the need for companies to maintain their own physical hardware. Blockchain applications tend to be compute-intensive though, which drives up the costs Web3 that companies are paying to public cloud providers. Crypto is big business for Amazon in particular, which hosts 35% of all Ethereum nodes, according to the website ethernodes. Nirvana Cloud says it can offer much reduced costs and better efficiency for blockchain workloads compared to AWS by doing away with unnecessary virtualization. In computing, virtualization allows for the creation of virtual machines (VMs) that operate independently from their underlying physical hardware. This essentially turns one physical computer into many virtual ones, allowing each to run its own tasks as if it were a separate machine. In short, virtualization makes it possible to run many different applications and processes without needing multiple physical computers. This lets cloud service providers offer a more efficient and flexible service to customers. But traditional services like AWS and Google Cloud, while versatile, often adopt a general-purpose approach that may not be as cost or resource-efficient for specific applications, like the energy-intensive ones found in Web3. Read more: Cloud computing is operated by an anti-competitive oligopoly, says Osuri Nirvana Labs addresses this by reducing the virtualization layer. It slims down the middleman software and focuses its hardware on the specific needs of Web3 technologies, like cryptocurrency transactions or smart contracts. The result is a setup that’s not just faster and more reliable for these tasks, but also more cost-effective. A Nirvana Labs document reviewed by Blockworks suggests that, for a setup with two virtual CPUs and 8 gigabytes of RAM, Nirvana Cloud costs about 19.5% less than AWS and 26.91% less than Google Cloud Platform per month. According to the company, Nirvana Cloud distinguishes itself by offering a “bare metal” cloud service. Unlike typical cloud environments where server resources are shared among multiple consumers, each Nirvana server is dedicated to a single client. This approach, where hardware resources are not pooled, is meant to ensure superior performance for computation-heavy tasks, like blockchain validation, by maximizing the efficiency and reliability of the service. Read more: Google Cloud eyes more involvement in fast-evolving Web3 segment However, some would argue that solutions like Nirvana’s don’t go far enough — and that computing resources will always be a risk for crypto unless the base layer is decentralized. “We have decentralized payments. We have decentralized storage. We have to have decentralized compute or else this whole decentralized world isn’t really decentralized,” Tom Trowbridge, co-founder of decentralized computing platform Fluence, said. But in the interim, increased scrutiny on the cloud layer couldn’t hurt. Burke said that the Web3 development world often doesn’t think enough about what’s happening at the tech’s layer zero. He jokingly added, “I mean, we have a company in the space called LayerZero that’s literally built on Google Cloud.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

The conviction comes after a trio of judges upheld allegations that Pertsev aided in laundering funds through the crypto mixer, which has been under scrutiny for its role in high-profile cybercrimes, including a $600 million heist affecting the Ronin Bridge, linked to the notorious Lazarus Group from North Korea. Defense arguments posited that holding developers accountable for the potential misuse of decentralized platforms sets a dangerous precedent, a sentiment widely supported in the cryptocurrency sector. However, the court dismissed these defenses, emphasizing that the design of Tornado Cash was inherently aimed at supporting illegal activities and that technological innovation does not absolve individuals from legal responsibilities. Pertsev’s arrest in August 2022 followed shortly after the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) imposed sanctions on Tornado Cash for its alleged roles in laundering and financing illicit activities. Initially detained for eight months, Pertsev was later placed under house arrest. The court has decided that his time served will be deducted from the total sentence, effectively reducing his remaining prison term to approximately four years and six months. This case could significantly influence how global legal systems interpret and manage decentralized privacy technologies and crypto mixers. While Pertsev’s co-founders, Roman Storm and Roman Semenov, face similar charges in the United States, broader regulatory challenges persist. In the U.S., the debate intensifies as lawmakers and enforcement agencies clash over the regulatory framework for digital assets and decentralized finance (DeFi), highlighting a critical need for clarity and consensus in digital currency governance. Recent inquiries by U.S. Senators into the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network’s (FinCEN) approach to prosecuting crypto mixers as illegal money transmitters underscore the ongoing legislative and judicial complexities surrounding cryptocurrency operations. As the sector continues to evolve, the outcomes of such cases will likely have profound implications for the development and regulation of privacy-focused technologies in the financial landscape. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

48::https://theconversation.com/ethereum-what-is-it-and-why-has-the-price-gone-parabolic-153733::The Conversation::article::Ethereum: what is it and why has the price gone parabolic?::While bitcoin is only a currency, the second-largest cryptocurrency is at the heart of a platform that aims to transform the internet.::The price of the world’s second largest cryptocurrency, ether, hit a new all-time high of US$1,440 (£1,050) on January 19. This breached a previous high set three years ago and gave ether a total value (market capitalisation) of US$160 billion, although it has since fallen back to around US$140 billion. Ether, which runs on a technology system known as the ethereum blockchain, is worth over ten times the price it was when it bottomed during the COVID market panic of March 2020. And the cryptocurrency is still only five years old. In part, this remarkable rise in the value is due to excess money flowing into all the leading cryptocurrencies, which are now seen as relatively safe store-of-value assets and a good speculative investment. Ether/US$ price But ether’s price rise has even outstripped that of the number one cryptocurrency, bitcoin, which “only” had a seven-fold increase since March. Ether has outperformed partly due to several improvements and new features being rolled out over the next few months. So what are ether and ethereum and why is this cryptocurrency now worth more than corporate giants such as Starbucks and AstraZeneca? Blockchains are online ledgers that keep permanent tamper-proof records of information. These records are continually verified by a network of computer nodes similar to servers, which are not centrally controlled by anyone. Ether is just one of over 8,000 cryptocurrencies that use some form of this technology, which was invented by the anonymous “Satoshi Nakamoto” when he released bitcoin over a decade ago. The ethereum blockchain was first outlined in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, a 19-year old prodigy who was born in Russia but mostly grew up in Canada. After crowdfunding and development in 2014, the platform was launched in July 2015. As with the bitcoin blockchain, each ethereum transaction is confirmed when the nodes on the network reach a consensus that it took place – these verifiers are rewarded in ether for their work, in a process known as mining. But the bitcoin blockchain is confined to enabling digital, decentralised money – meaning money that is not issued from any central institution unlike, say, dollars. Ethereum’s blockchain is categorically different in that it can host both other digital tokens or coins, and decentralised applications. Decentralised applications or “dapps” are open-source programs developed by communities of coders not attached to any company. Any changes to the software are voted on by the community using a consensus mechanism. Perhaps the best known applications running on the ethereum blockchain are “smart contracts”, which are programs that automatically execute all or parts of an agreement when certain conditions are met. For instance, a smart contract could automatically reimburse a customer if, say, a flight was delayed more than a prescribed amount of time. Many of the dapp communities are also operating what is known as decentralised autonomous organisations or DAOs. These are essentially alternatives to companies and seen by many as the building blocks of the next phase of the internet or “web 3.0”. A good example is the burgeoning trading exchange Sushiswap. Ethereum has evolved and developed since its launch six years ago. In 2016, a set of smart contracts known as “The DAO” raised a record US$150 million in a crowdsale but was quickly exploited by a hacker who siphoned off one- third of the funds. However, since then, the ethereum ecosystem has matured considerably. While hacks and scams remain common, the overall level of professionalism appears to have improved dramatically. Financial interest in ether tends to follow in the wake of bitcoin rallies because it is the second-largest cryptocurrency and, as such, quickly draws the attention of the novice investor. All the same, there are other factors behind its recent rally. The first is the pace of innovation on the platform. Most activity in the cryptocurrency space happens on ethereum. In 2020, we saw the emergence of decentralised finance (DeFi). DeFi is analogous to the mainstream financial world, but with the middleman banks cut out. Users can borrow, trade, lend and invest through autonomous smart contracts via protocols like Compound, Aave and Yearn Finance. It sounds like science fiction, but this is no hypothetical market – approximately US$24 billion is locked into various DeFi projects right now. Importantly, DeFi allows users to generate income on their cryptocurrency holdings, especially their ether tokens. The second factor behind the ether surge is the launch of ethereum 2.0. This upgrade addresses major concerns impacting the current version of ethereum. In particular, it will reduce transaction fees – especially useful in DeFi trading, where each transaction can end up costing the equivalent of tens of US dollars. Ethereum 2.0 will also eliminate the environmentally wasteful mining currently required to make the ethereum blockchain function (the same is true of many other cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin). Within the year, ethereum should be able to drop the need for vast industrial mining warehouses that consume huge amounts of energy. Instead, transactions will be validated using a different system known as “proof-of-stake”. The sense that ethereum addresses problems like these quickly rather than letting them sit could prove a major differential from the sometimes sluggish and conservative pace of the bitcoin development culture. A final factor is the launch of ethereum futures trading on February 8. This means that traders will be able to speculate on what ether will be worth at a given date in the future for the first time – a hallmark of any mature financial asset. Some analysts have said the recent bitcoin rally has been fuelled by traditional investment firms, and the launch of ethereum futures is often touted as opening the doors for the same price action. However, as every seasoned cryptocurrency user knows, both currencies are extremely volatile and are as liable to crash by extremes as rise by them. Bitcoin’s price fell 85% in the year after the last bull market in 2017, while ether was down by 95% at one stage from its previous high of US$1,428. Whatever the valuation, the future of ethereum as a platform looks bright. Its challenge is ultimately external: projects such as Cardano and Polkadot, created by individuals who helped launch ethereum itself, are attempting to steal ethereum’s crown. But as bitcoin has shown, first-mover advantage matters in cryptocurrency, and despite bitcoin’s relative lack of features it is unlikely to be moved from its dominant position for some time. The same is most likely true for the foreseeable future with ethereum.::2021-01-21T19:41:57Z::Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, DeFi, Ethereum, Web 3.0::Donncha Kavanagh::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/379971/original/file-20210121-13-i5zie0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=5%2C281%2C3910%2C1952&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

The sale of GBTC shares was completed on April 2, the documents show. On Feb. 15, Genesis received permission from a New York bankruptcy court to sell the nearly 36 million shares in GBTC, as well as additional shares in two Grayscale Ethereum trusts. At the time of the application, lawyers for the estate valued the Grayscale shares at a collective $1.6 billion – nearly $1.4 billion in GBTC, $165 million in Grayscale Ethereum Trust, and $38 million in Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust. At today’s price of around $67,500, the bitcoin purchased with the proceeds of the GBTC shares alone are worth nearly $2.2 billion. As for what Genesis will do with its large bitcoin stack, initial plans are for the tokens to be distributed to its Gemini Earn creditors. Edited by Stephen Alpher.

50::https://ambcrypto.com/as-bitcoin-dominance-drops-chainlink-exploits-the-market-shift-how/::AMBCrypto::article::As Bitcoin dominance drops, Chainlink exploits the market shift – How?::Chainlink’s price spiked by 20% in the last seven days as accumulation increased.::Chainlink’s price spiked by 20% in the last seven days as accumulation increased.  Chainlink [LINK] has gained much traction of late as its price rallied substantially during the last week. Interestingly, the token’s popularity rose while Bitcoin [BTC] dominance witnessed a slight drop in the recent past. Let’s take a closer look at what’s actually going on. Source: CoinStats IntoTheBlock recently posted a tweet highlighting quite a few interesting developments related to Chainlink.  The tweet first mentioned that there was a significant rise in LINK search trend data, reflecting newfound interest in the token. The rise in popularity had a positive impact on the blockchain’s network activity, as its number of transactions started spiking. To be precise, LINK recorded 5.82k transactions during the last day, which was near its monthly high. However, it was interesting to note that the rise in transactions didn’t help attract more users, as there was not a major change in its new address graph. But things looked good in terms of investors’ interest as accumulation increased. As per the tweet, there were mostly net withdrawals from exchanges, hinting at accumulation behavior. Apart from that, whales were also stockpiling LINK, as its addresses holding over 0.1% of the supply show a net accumulation of 25 million LINK over the past month. The rise in accumulation actually helped the token begin a bull rally. According to CoinMarketCap, LINK was up by more than 20% in the last seven days. At the time of writing, it was trading at $16.22 with a market capitalization of over $9.5 billion. Thanks to that, LINK’s MVRV ratio registered a massive increase, suggesting that more investors were in profit. Its Open Interest also increased along with its price, hinting at a continued price rally. Source: Santiment Interestingly, Santiment recently posted a tweet highlighting that bullish sentiment around the token increased. In fact, Chainlink was witnessing the most bullish sentiment in over a year. However, these positive metrics didn’t help LINK sustain its bull rally, as the token’s price dropped by nearly 2% in the last 24 hours. To see whether this was the end of LINK’s double-digit bull rally, AMBCrypto analyzed its daily chart. As per our analysis, the MACD remained in the buyers’ favor. Is your portfolio green? Check out the LINK Profit Calculator Moreover, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) registered a sharp uptick. This indicated that the latest price correction might be short-term and that LINK would resume its rally soon. However, the token’s price had touched the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands, which looked concerning.

The project aims to distribute 30,000,000 Toncoin in three months, highlighting the network’s commitment to growth and community engagement, 🔥 TON DeFi is on Fire! 🔥$TON just crossed $200M Total Value Locked (TVL) When @TONOpenLeague began @ March 1st. TVL stood at $22.9million. Since then TVL has grown 900% to $206.74 Million. Time to Double Down. JOIN https://t.co/oW0WjBJ8KB pic.twitter.com/AU5t7PZXvp The launch has thus far been a success, with a 70% increase in total value locked on its decentralized exchanges and a 370% surge in daily active addresses during the pilot phase. With high scalability, efficient transaction processing, and ongoing development, TON’s enhanced features may lead to wider adoption and new applications, cementing its long-term viability. When choosing a wallet for storing Toncoin, it is important to consider security, ease of use, and specific functionalities that align with your requirements. Importantly, always conduct your research to understand the nuances and updates associated with each wallet. Doing so can help you make an informed decision that best suits your needs in managing and securing your TON. Toncoin is the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network (TON). It serves multiple purposes within the network, including facilitating transaction fees and participating in governance decisions. As a cryptocurrency, Toncoin plays a crucial role in the functionality and decentralization of the TON ecosystem. Toncoin has a promising future due to its integral role in a growing blockchain network that supports scalable and efficient digital transactions. Its utility within the network and its participation in governance processes suggest it will remain relevant as the network expands. The community-driven approach to its development could also lead to further innovation and adoption. Toncoin can be securely stored in several wallets, which supports its blockchain technology. Popular choices include Coinbase Wallet, which is known for its ease of use; Ledger, a hardware wallet offering high security; OKX Wallet, which provides a gateway into web3; YouHodler Wallet, known for crypto loan offerings and its user-friendly interface; and Bitget Wallet, which supports a variety of cryptocurrencies including TON. While the founders of Telegram initially developed Toncoin, it is not directly part of the Telegram messaging platform. An independent community of developers handles the development and governance of Toncoin and the TON blockchain. This ensures that cryptocurrency operates under a decentralized model separate from Telegram’s control.

52::https://blockworks.co/news/blockchain-transparency-bug::Blockworks::article::Blockchain transparency is a bug::Opinion: Blockchain transparency is making Web3 the surveillance tool it was meant to free societies from.::Blockchain transparency is making Web3 the surveillance tool it was meant to free societies from Artwork by Crystal Le Blockchain transparency is a bug. Transparency isn’t a feature of decentralization that is truly needed to perform on-chain transactions securely — it’s a bug that forces Web3 users to expose their most sensitive financial data to anyone who wants to see it. Several blockchain marketing tools have emerged over the past few years, allowing marketers and salespeople to use the freely flowing on-chain data for user insights and targeted advertising. But this time, it’s not just behavioral data that is analyzed. Now, your most sensitive financial information is also added to the mix. Web3 will never become mainstream unless we manage to solve this transparency problem. Blockchain and Web3 were an escape from centralized power, making information transparent so that centralized entities cannot own one’s data. Then 2020 came, Web3 and NFTs boomed, and many started talking about how free flowing, available-to-all data is a clear improvement from your data being “stolen” by big data companies as a customer. Some may think if everyone can see the data, transparency will empower users to take ownership of and profit from their own data. Yet, transparency does not mean data can’t be appropriated nor that users are really in control. The fact that data is transparent and flowing freely doesn’t mean it cannot be appropriated; in fact, data appropriation is already happening in Web3. Many are taking advantage of all of this open data to simplify on-chain data analysis and monetize it for anyone interested in learning the behavioral patterns of Web3 users. With the immense number of transactions and wallets, the large volume of data becomes a goldmine for those skilled enough to understand it. Transparency opened doors for Web2’s profiling practices to enter Web3. Tools like Nansen or Addressable help agencies and advertisers gather transactional and asset-held data to analyze consumer behavior and holdings to understand trends, create potential customer profiles and launch targeted advertising programs. Privacy projects will argue that total privacy as a given is the only way to protect users. Yet, they aren’t right either. Users already need — and increasingly will need — to use their on-chain data to verify holdings and transactions for regulatory purposes and verifications. If everything is private and cannot be selectively encrypted, there is no way to verify the funds and their origins. Many such privacy solutions have already been sanctioned by governments. Read more from our opinion section: Ethereum L2s are a bug masquerading as a feature At the same time, users might want to proudly showcase some of their assets (like NFTs). But this doesn’t mean they want to allow everyone else to peek into all their other crypto holdings and transactions (which they do, since an address holding a certain NFT can be checked). Take 50 people holding NFTs for one project, analyze their other holdings and trends across transactional patterns, and you have a pretty accurate user profile you can target. Web3 needs to shift from the appropriation of freely flowing data to a data ownership model, where users get full control over what data gets shared, with whom, when and how. Vitalik Buterin addressed this transparency problem, posing a similar solution in his September paper on blockchain privacy and regulatory compliance. He argued that transparency is a security issue and showed there is a way to allow Web3 to be compliant and transparent only when needed. The solutions and the technology to make this shift are here. What is now needed is a change in user mindset and awareness that this transparency bug exists. Blockchain transparency is making Web3 become the surveillance tool it was meant to free societies from. It poses a growing concern, especially as the popularity of community rewards platforms increases and more and more users are combining their wallet addresses with social media accounts. The Web3 crowd needs to be educated about the risks of keeping all their data out in the open. In the decentralized world, the change needs to happen bottom-up as people realize how their blockchain transactions are being monetized for uses they have no control over.

Discover the latest updates and ongoing connectivity issues post-outage.::Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange based in the United States, has announced the restoration of some services following a significant system-wide outage that temporarily halted trading activities across its website and mobile application. The issue, initially reported on May 14, resulted in restricted access for numerous users, who experienced difficulties connecting to the platform. Approximately two hours after first acknowledging the disruption, Coinbase conveyed through an update that while services were partially restored, some users might still face connectivity issues. The initial incident, occurring at approximately 21:19 PDT on May 13, was reported on Coinbase’s status page, indicating that users could encounter errors when attempting to send funds. However, specifics regarding the cause of these failures were not provided. As of the latest update, the Coinbase status page has declared the incident resolved, though the exact reasons behind the two-hour outage remain undisclosed. Typically, centralized cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase suffer downtimes due to market volatility spikes or surges in blockchain network traffic. A previous technical hiccup in March saw similar disruptions, with Coinbase users witnessing zero balances in their accounts during a Bitcoin surge, as noted by Bloomberg. This incident underscored the susceptibility of crypto trading platforms to technical setbacks amid market fluctuations. Contrastingly, the recent outage appears to stem from internal technical issues within the exchange’s infrastructure, as market data from CoinGecko shows minimal movement in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), with changes of +0.31% and -0.44% respectively over the past 24 hours. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

54::https://cryptobriefing.com/senators-question-crypto-transmitter-laws/::Crypto Briefing::article::Senators question DOJ for 'unprecedented interpretation' over Samourai Wallet and Tornado Cash::Senators say that the crypto mixer services under scrutiny don't meet money transmitter definitions.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) have sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland, questioning the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) “unprecedented interpretation” of the law in its pursuit of cryptocurrency software services, such as Samourai Wallet and Tornado Cash, as unlicensed money-transmitting businesses. The senators argue that the DOJ’s approach contradicts previous guidance from the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which held that non-custodial crypto services should not be treated as money transmitters. The lawmakers express concern that the DOJ’s interpretation could treat software developers as criminals for “merely writing and publishing code” used by others, setting a dangerous precedent that contradicts settled law and raises First Amendment concerns. The letter specifically addresses the DOJ’s recent pursuit of Samourai Wallet, a crypto privacy business, last month. The senators argue that subjecting developers of non-custodial crypto asset software to potential criminal liability as unregistered money transmitters goes against the well-established interpretation of the law. The DOJ has also argued in a court filing that FinCEN’s guidance on crypto mixers did not address the idea of “control,” a stance that the senators’ letter takes issue with. The lawmakers maintain that the rule actually requires the service to take control of the funds to be treated as a transmitter. Senator Lummis emphasized the importance of the issue, stating: “I’m concerned the DOJ’s interpretation would treat software developers as criminals for merely writing and publishing code used by others […]” The letter comes as Congress grapples with establishing comprehensive digital assets legislation, including money-laundering protections. A legislative piece called FIT21 (Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act) is expected to go up for deliberation by the House of Representatives soon. However, such a legislative piece would only be specific to the governance of crypto markets and would not, as such, establish clearer definitions of what constitutes illicit transactions or the facilitation of such exchanges through open software.

55::https://theconversation.com/decentralised-finance-calls-into-question-whether-the-crypto-industry-can-ever-be-regulated-151222::The Conversation::article::Decentralised finance calls into question whether the crypto industry can ever be regulated::It is near impossible to regulate currencies and financial services that were built to avoid regulation – but it is increasingly necessary::As stock markets around the world struggle through the pandemic, Bitcoin has seen a steady rise in its price. The cryptocurrency is steadily climbing back towards its all time high of US$20,000 (£15,000) in 2017. While this growth can be partially explained by investors being spooked by stock markets during the pandemic and looking for better investments, it is also influenced by the new, but evolving, decentralised finance market, also known as DeFi. DeFi allows people to engage in financial services such as borrowing, lending and investing but without intermediaries such as banks using blockchains and cryptocurrencies. Blockchains store digital records of transactions. Individual records, called “blocks”, are linked together in a single list, which creates the “blockchain”. Blockchains are used in DeFi to create “smart contracts”, which are automated, enforceable agreements that don’t need intermediaries, such as banks. The DeFi market is one to watch. It has grown to become worth US$14.61 billion – an increase of almost 700% since the beginning of 2020. DeFi has enormous potential in international trade by making payments more efficient. It could do away with the need to use intermediaries such as correspondent banks, which are financial institutions that offer services to a customer on behalf of another bank, usually in a foreign country. DeFi could also potentially help with the availability and equality of opportunities to access financial services. There is, however, a difficulty holding any particular person or entity accountable for any technological failure in this market. This can be anything from security failures, when the system is hacked and digital assets are stolen, to the collapse of the entire system. Read more: While coronavirus rages, bitcoin has made a leap towards the mainstream Unlike traditional banks, which can be sanctioned or shut down, there is nobody who can be held accountable or take responsibility when something goes wrong. This is because the applications in DeFi are built on decentralised systems, which distribute functions and power away from a central location or authority. Every node (computer, IP, server) connected to the system makes its own decision, and the final behaviour of the system is a collection of the decisions of these individual nodes. This is further complicated by the fact that DeFi transactions typically operate globally, and when regulatory standards are created for this sector in one country, platforms may gravitate to countries with less strict ones. There is also the challenge of global coordination, especially as countries are at varying stages of financial regulatory development. While advanced economies such as the UK and US have stronger regulatory frameworks, most in developing economies do not. DeFi platforms are also subject to hacks and cyberattacks and are growing platforms for money laundering. These factors raise the question of whether decentralised platforms can ever be regulated, or if the rules for the crypto industry set by the Financial Actions Task Force (FATF), the global anti-money laundering watchdog, is robust enough. FATF only covers centralised systems or virtual assets service providers such as cryptocurrency exchanges. These are licensed businesses that allow customers to trade crypto or digital currencies for other assets, such as fiat currencies like the pound sterling, US dollars and euros. Such exchanges must adhere to FATF’s “know your customer” requirements, where the platforms are expected to know the parties transacting on them. FATF requirements do not cover financial activities occurring on decentralised systems. The idea of regulating centralised platforms and cryptocurrency exchanges – where people purchase crypto to use to transact on DeFi platforms, but leaving DeFi platforms unregulated – limits the overall effectiveness of the regulation of the whole crypto industry. Unless it is built into the source code of a decentralised application, it is difficult to see how regulation can be achieved. This would require cooperation with blockchain software developers. However, this may be placing too much power in their hands as they could manipulate the code to circumvent regulatory oversight at any time they choose to. Regulators may not want to do this. They could try to ban such activities instead. In the EU and the US, legislation has been proposed that could potentially ban the operation of DeFi. These include the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) Regulation proposed by the EU and the US Stable Bill proposed in December 2020. Although it is not impossible to shut off a decentralised system, it is very difficult to achieve and it would require heavy reliance on government or regulatory authorities. It would also require getting access to IP addresses, cooperating with local internet service providers, identifying or tracing the physical location of people using the system and using the police to effectively shut down such platforms or activities. Locating and then prosecuting anyone within one jurisdiction would not be an easy task. Although this would potentially deter people from using these services and slow down the number of people using them for illegal means, it would be difficult to achieve on a global scale – which would threaten international standards. What is clear is that regulators need to acquire technological expertise and be willing to engage with a wider group of stakeholders, including software developers, to effectively regulate DeFi. It is worth noting that DeFi has been built mainly on the Ethereum blockchain, just as initial coin offerings (ICOs) were in 2017. ICOs eventually fizzled out due to their links with fraud. Whatever its future, DeFi is a fast-growing industry and deserves urgent regulatory attention.::2020-12-11T14:59:16Z::Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, DeFi, Finance, Regulation::Iwa Salami::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/374396/original/file-20201211-23-16e01n4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=53%2C377%2C6000%2C3000&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

The new APs include Wall Street banking giants Goldman Sachs, Citadel Securities, Citigroup and UBS as well as clearing house ABN AMRO, according to a prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). They join Jane Street Capital, JP Morgan, Masquarie and Virtu Americas. CoinDesk reported in January that Goldman Sachs was looking to play a key role for the bitcoin ETFs and was in talks with issuers about becoming an AP. APs are an integral part of the ETF process as they help create liquidity by changing the supply of shares when there’s a shortage or a surplus. Large ETFs typically have dozens of APs, and in less than three months of existence, IBIT has become fairly sizable with nearly $18 billion in assets under management as of the close yesterday. The participation of Goldman Sachs is particularly notable as its wealth management chief investment officer just this week said the bank believes that crypto has "no value" and feels no pressure to participate in the space even as other TradFi giants are taking major steps.

57::https://ambcrypto.com/whale-watch-1b-in-toncoin-trades-shake-the-market-tracking-whats-next/::AMBCrypto::article::Whale watch: $1B in Toncoin trades shake the market, tracking what’s next::The recent uptick in large transactions on the Toncoin network has not impacted TON’s performance. ::The recent uptick in large transactions on the Toncoin network has not impacted TON’s performance.  Toncoin [TON] has witnessed a spike in whale activity on its network in the past few weeks, CryptoQuant analyst Joao Wedson found in a new report. According to Wedson, whale transactions between 100,000 and 1 million TON on the network recently surpassed $1 billion, “Indicating significant activity among the largest addresses on the network.” Wedson added that while the smaller transactions under 100 TON make up the vast majority of the total activity on the Toncoin network, although,  “Their impact is relatively low, moving only around 4 to 5 million TON on the blockchain.” In contrast, large transactions between 100,000 and 1 million TON account for more than half (53%) of the network’s total volume. Further, transactions exceeding 1 million TON currently represent 30% of Toncoin’s total volume. Despite the surge in whale activity on its network, TON is poised to breach the lower line of its ascending channel, which formed a key support level since the beginning of the month. When an asset’s price trends this way, it signals that selling pressure is overcoming buying pressure, and a price decline might be imminent. TON’s recent fall below its 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) increases the likelihood of its price decline. Readings from the coin’s price movements on a daily chart showed that TON’s price crossed below its 20-day EMA on the 17th of May. This marked the first time this has happened since the month began. This crossover is significant because it suggests that TON’s press time price has fallen under its average price of the past 20 days. It marks a shift toward selling momentum and a possible decline in the coin’s price. Since then, TON’s value has dropped by 3%. According to CoinMarketCap, the altcoin traded at $6.45 at press time. Confirming the rise in bearish sentiments, TON’s MACD line was about to fall below its signal line at the time of writing. Source: TON/USDT on TradingView Is your portfolio green? Check out the TON Profit Calculator When this happens, it would mean that the coin’s short-term moving average has crossed below its long-term moving average, signifying a loss of upward momentum. If TON breaches support, its price might fall under $6 to trade at $5.70. However, if this is invalidated, a rally toward $6.7 is in the books.

It has since become a major player in the blockchain space. Tezos facilitates the development and execution of smart contracts, which are basically self-executing agreements that power decentralized applications (DApps). Tezos allows stakeholders to participate in the network’s security and evolution by voting on proposed upgrades to the protocol. This approach eliminates the need or scope for any disruptive hard fork, which can ultimately fracture the user base. Notably, Tezos uses a unique proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism called liquid proof-of-stake (LPoS). Unlike many other blockchains, Tezos prioritizes formal verification, a process that enhances smart contract security by minimizing vulnerabilities. The platform also emphasizes modularity and upgradability, ensuring long-term scalability and adaptation. Tezos staking allows users to participate in the network’s consensus mechanism and contribute to its security. This is achieved through “baking” or delegating XTZ, Tezos’ native cryptocurrency. Bakers are champions of democracy. They accept delegation from tezos users through a liquid staking mechanic native to the chain. In turn, they are responsible for voting on Tezos issues in a manner that they feel furthers the interests of their delegates AND dole out staking… Baking vs. delegating: The delegation process in Tezos is relatively smooth and secure. It allows XTZ holders to contribute to network security without having to invest any substantial capital. Additionally, it safeguards them from the risk of asset loss due to slashing, which is a penalty enforced in many other proof-of-stake networks. This makes Tezos staking a popular choice for users looking to earn passive income while supporting network operations. You have two options if you plan on staking on the Tezos network. You could either be a baker or delegate your tokens to a baker. Each approach has advantages and drawbacks, so understanding the nuances is key to picking the one that best suits your risk appetite and goal. Bakers are the lifeblood of the Tezos network. They shoulder critical tasks like validating transactions, creating new blocks, and proposing and voting on network growth changes. However, this power comes with a hefty price tag — you must acquire a collateral of around 6,000 XTZ. This substantial financial commitment isn’t the only hurdle. As a baker, you also need specialized hardware to run the baking software and a decent amount of technical expertise to configure and manage their setups. Furthermore, you may have to be on your toes constantly to minimize downtime. This is important because a baker’s reputation depends squarely on their ability to run node operations reliably. That said, the rewards for bakers can be quite enticing. As a baker, you retain all block yields, ensuring a potentially lucrative return on your investment. So, to cut a long story short, bakers typically earn good returns on their investments, but baking is not a job for everyone. It demands serious commitment and comes with significant responsibility. You could consider delegating your XTZ to a baker if active participation seems overwhelming. This approach offers a more laid-back alternative. Your XTZ remains safely stored in your wallet, and you will have peace of mind knowing you have full control over your assets. This setup allows you to passively earn rewards and maintain a consistent source of passive income without any extra effort. While delegating offers flexibility, you have to beware of a few limitations. For instance, you can’t split your XTZ holdings across multiple bakers within the same wallet. However, you can change your delegation anytime by transferring your funds to a different wallet. Also, carefully evaluate a baker’s track record and commitment to fair reward distribution before signing up. Bakers typically charge a fee for their services, so assessing their fee structure and historical performance is crucial. If you are unsure whether to become a baker or a delegator, remember that it ultimately boils down to your risk tolerance, level of technical expertise, and the amount of time you can realistically dedicate to network participation. Follow these steps to start staking Tezos. For this demonstration, we’ll use Coinbase due to its user-friendly interface. The centralized exchange combines user-friendliness and security, making it a good option for XTZ staking. Other reputable options include Binance, Kraken, and OKX. The ideal platform depends on your priorities. Consider factors like security measures, ease of use, fees associated with staking, and the estimated annual yield (APY) offered. These factors can significantly impact your experience and the rewards you earn. Coinbase offers an APY of 4.51% on XTZ staking as of May 8, 2024. After choosing Coinbase as your staking platform, ensure you have Tezos (XTZ) in your account. You can purchase XTZ directly using fiat currency (USD or EUR) on Coinbase or transfer it from another wallet if you already own some. However, before proceeding any further, check your platform’s minimum staking amount requirement. Coinbase doesn’t have any minimum amount requirement, meaning you can start staking with 1 XTZ. Go to the staking section and choose from a list of available bakers or validators. Bakers are responsible for validating transactions and creating new blocks on the Tezos network. Evaluate each baker’s performance, reputation, and fees to find the best match that meets your expectations. Once you’ve selected a baker, specify the amount of XTZ you wish to delegate and confirm the transaction. You might need to verify the transaction using your password, PIN, or a security device, depending on your security settings. You will see a stake preview window. And that’s it! You have officially started earning rewards through Tezos staking. Tezos staking is beneficial for the staker and the network. Some of the key benefits of staking on Tezos include: While staking Tezos can earn you sizable profits, it’s important to understand the potential drawbacks: While it’s true that Tezos staking offers some exciting opportunities, just like with any other investment, there are certain risks. Here’s how you can avoid some of the common staking mistakes. Tezos rewards are shelled out periodically, with payouts happening after each cycle. These cycles clock in at roughly three days each. That said, there is a catch for those new to the staking game: an initial waiting period stands between you and your first Tezos payout. You may have to exercise patience for a few weeks after delegating your XTZ to a baker. This delay is necessary for the network to integrate your new delegation and ensure that your baking and endorsing rights are accurately factored in. As a Tezos staker, you may enjoy substantial rewards. Remember that staking rewards are taxable income in many jurisdictions, and Tezos staking is no exception. The exact tax implications may vary dramatically depending on your region. As a general rule of thumb, tax authorities expect individuals to report their staking rewards as income. This means you’ll be taxed on the fair market value of the XTZ you receive at the time of distribution. Keep in mind that it is not a matter of how much you paid for the original XTZ you staked. Rather, you will be paying taxes on the value of the newly minted XTZ rewards. You may also be subject to capital gains tax if you decide to sell your hard-earned staking rewards. This applies if the value of XTZ has climbed since you received it as a reward. We highly recommend users keep meticulous records of the dates and values when they receive and sell their XTZ. This is a must if you want to ensure you comply with tax regulations accurately. Kraken is a leading Tezos staking platform thanks to its superior security and commitment to user experience. Security-conscious users will appreciate Kraken’s industry-leading protective measures, such as comprehensive cold storage solutions and mandatory two-factor authentication. The platform offers a diverse range of staking options and competitive fees, positioning it as a versatile choice for seasoned users. Users also benefit from Kraken’s consistent uptime and stringent adherence to regulatory standards. Coinbase serves as an ideal entry point for beginners with its user-friendly interface and intuitive staking process. Being a regulated entity, Coinbase prioritizes user safety by maintaining a secure trading environment. Additionally, the platform allows for the direct purchase of XTZ using fiat currencies, facilitating an easy process to buy and stake Tezos without the need for an intermediary service. Ledger is one of our top platforms for staking Tezos (XTZ), renowned for prioritizing security to ensure the safest staking experience. Its hardware wallet technology is engineered to provide the highest protection possible. When you stake XTZ using a Ledger Wallet, you retain complete control over your private keys, which are stored offline, offering you ultimate peace of mind. This setup secures your Tezos assets from online threats while empowering you with direct management of your assets without intermediary risks. Exodus Wallet is a leading platform for staking XTZ as it expertly balances security with ease of use. The wallet is designed with a straightforward, intuitive interface and includes integrated staking functionality directly within the software, allowing for straightforward management of XTZ holdings. This makes it an outstanding choice for newcomers and experienced users who value a hassle-free and secure staking process. Additionally, Exodus supports many other cryptocurrencies, offering users the flexibility to manage multiple assets within a single platform, further enhancing its appeal as a comprehensive digital asset solution. If you’re interested in earning substantial passive income, Tezos (XTZ) presents a compelling opportunity. According to the Tezos block explorer TzStats, the staking rate exceeds 67% as of May 8. 2024, indicating that over two-thirds of all circulating XTZ tokens are actively staked. This high participation rate highlights the continued demand for Tezos staking. Furthermore, by staking XTZ, you can reap financial rewards and contribute to shaping the future of Tezos through your active involvement in its development. Remember that profits are never guaranteed, and the value of your holdings can fluctuate according to market sentiment and demand. Tezos staking remains an attractive option in 2024. With well over 67% of all XTZ tokens staked as of May 8, 2024, you can join a sizable community of active stakers earning passive income while contributing to network security. Beyond the financial rewards, staking also allows you to influence Tezos’ future by participating in its ongoing development. The exact APY for Tezos staking can fluctuate depending on various factors. These may include the platform you are using, the current staking rate, and network inflation. Tezos staking typically offers a competitive APY compared to other staking opportunities. For example, Coinbase offers an APY of around 4.51% for XTZ staking, whereas the corresponding figure for Ledger Wallet can go as high as almost 6%. You have multiple options to choose from. Popular choices include hardware wallets like Ledger, which offer a secure and user-friendly experience. You can also stake through cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase or other dedicated staking platforms. Ideally, researching different options would help you find one that aligns with your security preferences and staking goals.

59::https://blockworks.co/news/blockchain-mainstream-adoption-history::Blockworks::article::Blockchain is one step away from mainstream adoption::Opinion: We’re months and years, not decades, away from widespread Web3 adoption.::What could come next for Web3 is grounded in history — and completely unpredictable Artwork by Crystal Le There’s plenty going on with crypto and blockchain right now. But the biggest news of the year is still the Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval of spot bitcoin ETFs — with $4.5 billion in trading volume in the first 24 hours, all eyes are on how this new investment vehicle will impact public engagement with crypto and blockchain. Because even though blockchain technology has been in use (and in the public discourse) for over a decade, it’s still accurate to compare its progress to the early days of the internet. Its nascent point in evolution — and clear potential for eventual disruption — echoes Clayton M. Christensen’s disruptive innovation theory, a theory which highlights how technologies overturn established markets. No matter how revolutionary or unique, fresh innovation remains intrinsically tied to the past. By learning lessons from pioneering technologies that are now accepted as core to life and society, we can navigate the complexities of this next great technological shift. While there will be challenges in acceptance and utility along the way, I believe blockchain’s path to imminent mass adoption closely mirrors the innovation cycles of past technologies with humble, then astronomical trajectories. And the SEC’s spot bitcoin ETF approval is a moment that signals both validation and acceleration. Let me explain. Like the nascent stages of both the internet and cloud computing, blockchain’s initial phase was marked by enthusiasm tempered with challenges. Early blockchain adopters — akin to pioneers of cloud infrastructure — faced skepticism, technological hurdles and a lack of clear market fit. Data from the early 2010s reflects a burgeoning interest in blockchain but also reveals the struggles for finding practical applications and widespread adoption. It was during this period that the cryptocurrency space became the primary use case for blockchain technology. Bitcoin’s rise sparked curiosity and fueled on-chain experimentation. But while the promise of decentralized, trustless systems captivated innovators, its practical implementation faced numerous obstacles. Scalability issues, regulatory uncertainties and the association of blockchain with volatile cryptocurrency markets hindered its broader adoption. Blockchain technology was truly in its infancy in the early 2010s. And as with every groundbreaking innovation, overcoming the initial challenges required time, perseverance and a commitment to refining the technology’s capabilities. Within two to three years, blockchain technology expanded from testing labs and hackathons to real world business applications used by global giants like IBM and Maersk. In making the leap relatively quickly, the tech entered a phase akin to the dot-com era’s consolidation — where performance, utility and UX took out the first wave of providers failing to meet enterprise, developer and user expectations. During this period, blockchain gained crucial market recognition and investment growth, and its solutions began to demonstrate real-world utility. The industry also witnessed the emergence of alternative blockchain platforms like Ethereum, each offering unique features and addressing the limitations of earlier iterations. The mid-2010s also marked a turning point for blockchain, with a surge in enterprise adoption and a notable influx of tech industry attention anchored largely by progressive larger companies and startups. Although regulatory frameworks began to take shape around the world, country-specific dynamics remained in the path of providing a more stable environment for businesses to explore and implement blockchain technology. In both the dot-com era internet and blockchain during this phase, viable business models emerged — and along with them, substantial investments that lay the foundation for long-term sustainability. Like dot-com, blockchain was experiencing cracks at the seams as the underlying infrastructure and technology transitioned swiftly from a speculative concept to a legitimate technological innovation vulnerable to system failures, user sentiment and industry scrutiny. In other words, the enterprise, commercial and potential user spotlight was on, but the backend infrastructure remained painfully slow and the frontend UX remained noticeably lacking. Blockchain’s current phase mirrors the cloud computing industry’s evolution from nascent testing group populated with startups and risk-taking enterprises into a market staple with room to improve. While there’s still significant progress to make in terms of adoption and onboarding, processing, security, interoperability and UX, the advancements happening on blockchain today are nearing web grade and web scale. Today, blockchain technology underpins applications across industries, from finance to supply chain management — and this is only the beginning. Recent market analyses highlight blockchain’s expanding footprint, indicating its transition from an emerging technology to an integral part of the global digital infrastructure akin to cloud in Web2. In my opinion, we’re months and years, not decades, away from people around the world using Web3 to make financial transactions, scroll social media and play games at Web2 speeds — with UX at a level where users might not realize their digital experience is made possible by blockchain. Blockchain’s growth is already reshaping traditional business processes and models. In the financial sector, blockchain facilitates faster and more secure transactions. Supply chain management benefits from increased transparency and traceability, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of products. Smart contracts automate and streamline complex agreements, minimizing the risk of fraud and error. And in addition to sparking rising trading volumes, the SEC’s approval of spot bitcoin ETFs sent a global signal of validation to governments reviewing the viability of blockchain applications in both the private and public sectors. Importantly, the evolution of blockchain has given credence to — and bestowed practicality upon — the concept of decentralized finance (DeFi). We’re already in a reality where traditional financial services are replicated, and even improved, using blockchain technology. This is transformative because it will eliminate the need for intermediaries, opening the door to financial participation for virtually anyone with internet access. This democratization of finance has the potential to provide financial services to underserved populations and redefine the global financial landscape. Today (literally today), blockchain technology sits at the brink of a new era of the internet — one fueled by decentralized ecosystems at web scale. As we move forward, businesses, policymakers and builders will increasingly search out responsible, interoperable and secure blockchains that have a proven ability to scale and meet the needs of millions worldwide who will be using it daily. Most importantly, we can build a more transparent, efficient and inclusive digital world in the process. Mo Shaikh is the Co-Founder & CEO of Aptos Labs.

Despite accruing substantial daily fees, Runes has only eclipsed the $1 million mark in total fees on two separate occasions within the last twelve days, highlighting a noticeable downtrend. Initially, Runes catalyzed an investor frenzy following its launch on April 19, which coincided with the most recent Bitcoin halving event. This launch period saw an unprecedented surge in transaction fees, with miners collecting over $135 million in the first week alone. The Runes protocol quickly dominated Bitcoin transactions, reaching a peak transaction share of 81.3% on April 23. However, this dominance was short-lived as activity began to taper off, with significant declines noted particularly on May 10. The analytics from Dune, a leading blockchain analytics platform, confirm these observations. After an initial robust performance, the fee revenue from the Runes protocol has shown a consistent decline. Despite the protocol’s ability to still generate hundreds of thousands of dollars daily on the Bitcoin blockchain, the dwindling frequency of surpassing the $1 million threshold points to a broader trend of decreased activity. Developed by Casey Rodarmor, also known for creating Ordinals which introduced non-fungible tokens to the Bitcoin network, Runes extends this innovation by facilitating the creation of fungible tokens. This development promised enhanced tokenization capabilities over the existing BRC-20 standard, leading to a significant initial uptake and a burst in meme coin trading on the platform. Despite the declining transaction share, Runes displayed a brief recovery in early May, with transaction shares rebounding above 60% on May 4 and 5. However, this was not sufficient to sustain the earlier levels of engagement, and overall miner revenue on the Bitcoin network fell to below $30 million per day in May. The Runes protocol, despite its early success and the creation of several high-value Rune collections as reported by Magic Eden, faces the challenge of maintaining traction in a volatile market. Further innovation remains on the horizon, as hinted by Rodarmor with a forthcoming audioreactive generative art project during an Ordinals event in Hong Kong, potentially revitalizing interest in the platform. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

61::https://cryptobriefing.com/euclid-unified-liquidity-layer/::Crypto Briefing::article::Euclid launches layer to connect liquidity across Cosmos, Solana, and EVM chains::Euclid's VLP model tackles DeFi's fragmented liquidity issue.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Euclid Protocol has announced today its shared liquidity layer that connects Cosmos, Solana, and Ethereum Virtual Machine-based ecosystems, powered by virtual pools created on Nibiru Chain. This effort is aimed at consolidating fragmented liquidity across the blockchain ecosystem. “We are excited to finally reveal the Unified Liquidity Layer, Euclid’s answer to the constantly growing challenge of fragmented liquidity,” said Georges Chouchani, founder and CEO of Euclid. “Euclid lays the groundwork for the next era of DeFi, aiming to provide users with a chain-agnostic modular experience. Its primary goals include ensuring scalability and fostering an efficient market environment.” The announcement points out the fragmented liquidity experienced by the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Despite showing nearly $136 billion in total value locked (TVL), these funds are scattered across DeFi. Euclid’s Virtual Liquidity Pool (VLP) model addresses this by virtually unifying liquidity without the need to physically move it, maintaining modularity and accessibility. The VLP allows for tracking and seamless movement of liquidity across all integrated chains. Moreover, those pools are created using Nibiru Chain as a Virtual Settlement Layer (Nibiru), creating a single source-of-truth ledger. This ledger connects all integrated blockchains, offering low slippage and fair pricing ecosystem-wide through the LiquiSync model, a framework that enables any chain or protocol to connect permissionlessly. “Euclid’s modular, accessible, and unified liquidity layer, powered by Nibiru Chain, is transforming the zero-sum nature of DeFi into a positive-sum game,” said Unique Divine, Co-Founder and CEO of Nibiru Chain. “This environment allows projects to synergize and scale together rather than just compete. Such synergy fosters collective advancements and competitive edges that could surpass those of established DeFi giants.” The reveal follows a successful $600,000 pre-seed funding round with the participation of Lavender Five, Andromeda, Nibiru Chain, Kahuna Network, and angel investor Tomoaki Sato. Last month, Euclid also secured a grant and liquidity backing to prime its pools for future use. These funds are earmarked for the development of the project’s architecture, business development, audits, and marketing efforts. Euclid’s roadmap includes extending its liquidity layer to encompass both EVM and non-EVM chains, leveraging protocols like IBC, CCTP, Axelar, and its own messaging protocol. The framework will be supported by EUCL, the native governance revenue share token, allowing holders to stake, receive protocol fees, participate in governance, and utilize the protocol’s treasury.

62::https://theconversation.com/altcoin-season-2-0-why-bitcoin-has-been-outgunned-by-crypto-rivals-since-new-year-132053::The Conversation::article::Altcoin season 2.0: why bitcoin has been outgunned by crypto rivals since new year::Bitcoin is up over 40% in 2020, but the likes of ethereum, bitcoin cash and bitcoin SV have all achieved triple-digit rises.::When bitcoin was trading at the dizzying heights of almost US$20,000 (£15,360) in December 2017, it was the peak of the previous bull run in cryptocurrencies. It was a classic bubble, in line with the work on such phenomena by the American financial economist Hyman Minsky, and investors should arguably have seen it coming. It was not until late 2018 that bitcoin finally bottomed out at slightly above US$3,000, though for many the “crypto winter” dragged on for much of 2019 as well. Several ups and downs later, the bull market looks to be back. Since the turn of the year, bitcoin has climbed from just over US$7,000 to the low US$10,000s. Few asset classes can boast a rise of about 40% in six weeks, though bitcoin enthusiasts like to point out that bitcoin is the best performing asset of the past decade – however choppy the journey along the way. Having said that, bitcoin is certainly not where you would have made most money if you had bought cryptocurrencies at the start of January. There have been even greater price gains from leading altcoins such as ethereum (+119%), ripple (+58%), bitcoin cash (+109%) and bitcoin SV (+222%). So what explains their superior performance? These four altcoins are the largest cryptocurrencies on the market after bitcoin, representing an aggregate US$51 billion market capitalisation (the value of each coin multiplied by the number of coins on the market). This is still fairly small compared with bitcoin’s US$178 billion market cap, but clearly the gap has been narrowing. Cryptocurrency aficionados compare bitcoin and the altcoins in terms of bitcoin dominance. This refers to bitcoin’s market size compared with the rest of the altcoins put together. During the early weeks of 2020, it fell slightly from 68% to 64%. As the chart below shows, this is a shift from what has happened for most of the past couple of years. Bitcoin dominance For years, there has tended to be a statistically significant correlation between the performance of bitcoin and the altcoins: when bitcoin rises or falls in price, most altcoins tend to do likewise. You can track this using online tools, such as Coinpredictor.io. Despite this correlation, altcoins have tended to underperform bitcoin ever since the previous bull market petered out in winter 2017-18. Bitcoin dominance was only 39% at the beginning of 2018, whereas it had risen to 70% by July 2019 and stayed around that range for most of the rest of the year. This suggests that bitcoin has acted as a safe harbour for many investors still smarting from the bubble and pop of 2017, which was fuelled by an explosion of initial coin offerings or ICOs from new currencies entering the market. Those who didn’t get out of cryptocurrencies altogether probably felt the need to consolidate around an asset they trusted. Bitcoin was the obvious choice as the longest established and most widely traded asset in this class, and also the gateway cryptocurrency for many investors – their first dip of a toe in the water en route to an altcoin purchase. Other writers have pointed out that during 2019, the price correlation between bitcoin and the altcoins declined. As many other cryptocurrency projects failed to live up to the heady expectations of a year or two before, investors perhaps traded them for bitcoin in a “flight to quality” – a little like traditional investors switching to the likes of gold when the stock market dives. The tilt back towards altcoins in the first weeks of 2020 may be the start of another bull-run, driven by a renewed confidence or understanding in the space. Recent favourable commercial developments have bolstered prices, such as JP Morgan’s positive progress with the interbank payments system that it runs on the ethereum network. The rise of the altcoins is also possibly being fuelled in part by an increasing number of coins entering the market. According to coinmarketcap, it now staggeringly numbers over 5,000. All other things being equal, this should reduce bitcoin dominance – this may be feeding through now that confidence has risen in the sector as a whole. There has also been a sector-wide boost from Coinbase, the largest cryptoasset exchange in the US. Coinbase is making a play for institutional investors by expanding its ability to store digital coins on their behalf outside the US. Known in the jargon as custodial solutions, Coinbase’s offering has just received two major industry kitemarks from leading accounting firm Grant Thornton, so may be attracting more institutional money into the sector. Another factor may be eagerly awaited initiatives from leading players such as the ethereum 2.0 launch, which looks set for July 2020. This major upgrade to the second-largest crypto network, which underpins many cryptocurrencies and enterprises in this space, is expected to make a big difference to transaction speeds among other things. One big question is whether bitcoin will start outperforming the altcoins again thanks to the so-called “halvening”, which is expected in May. This is the moment roughly every four years when the reward to bitcoin miners is halved, thereby reducing the number of new bitcoins available to sell on the market. Writers such as Jemima Kelly in the Financial Times make a strong case that this won’t raise the bitcoin price because the number of coins in circulation will still be rising and the event is built into the system so should be accounted for in the price already. Yet in a young market, which is comparatively thinly traded and has no uniform global regulation, the positive sentiment around this event may have more effect on the price than the fundamentals. We have previously argued in The Conversation that the chances of bitcoin replacing the global financial system have probably ended, now that many countries and multinationals, such as Facebook, are planning to launch cryptocurrencies of their own. All the same, the latest bull market is more evidence that bitcoin is likely to persist on the peripheries, probably along with the cream of the altcoins. Whether those altcoins can continue to outperform their bitcoin matriarch is a difficult question to answer, but they are showing encouraging signs of life. Naysayers who have predicted their steady demise may have spoken too soon.::2020-02-19T15:56:49Z::Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, Ethereum, Ripple::Gavin Brown::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/316197/original/file-20200219-11017-a7y6q2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=37%2C577%2C4105%2C2049&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

64::https://ambcrypto.com/predicting-how-eth-will-react-if-the-sec-approves-ethereum-etfs/::AMBCrypto::article::Predicting how ETH will react IF the SEC approves Ethereum ETFs::In spite of the general expectations, there is a chance the SEC will approve Ethereum ETFs.::In spite of the general expectations, there is a chance the SEC will approve Ethereum ETFs.  It is generally believed that the U.S. SEC will not approve any applications for the spot Ethereum [ETH] ETF due to several factors pointing to the fact that the agency’s new crypto enemy is Ethereum. But still, no real confirmation has been gotten from the agency itself on what it’s planning. So there is still a chance, no matter how slim, that the SEC would approve these ETFs. However, if they do, is the market ready for that impact? How would Ethereum’s price react?  Coinbase institutional research analyst David Han suggests there could be a surprising upside. In Coinbase’s monthly outlook report published on the 15th of May, Han mentioned that the odds of approval are between 30-40%. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has similarly set his approval odds at 35%. Meanwhile, the crypto community took a survey from Polymarket and the general estimate is 7% odds of approval. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, echoed the somewhat optimistic sentiment during an appearance on CNBC, saying that the SEC might approve spot ETH ETFs even if it does consider Ethereum a security Should the SEC approve an Ethereum ETF, the market could see an unexpected surge. However, Ethereum’s dominance and recent performance are trending toward their lowest point ever. Its SEC-proclaimed status as a security has negatively impacted investment sentiment. No one expects an approval, so Ether prices could likely see very little action in the near future. Bitcoin’s [BTC] price hardly reacted to its ETF approvals earlier this year. And the community were actually looking forward to it. Recently, the Funding Rate has been relatively low or negative, which could imply a cooling off of bullish momentum or increased caution among traders, especially during price dips as it happened in mid-April. Source: Coinglass Moreover, the increase in Open Interest despite lower trading volumes suggests that traders might be preparing for significant price moves ahead, as positions are being built up. But Ethereum’s trading chart shows a consistent bullish trend over a two-day period. The highest price point just above $3,160 could act as a short-term resistance level. Read Ethereum’s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25 Watching how the price reacts upon retesting this level could be critical for short-term investment strategies. Source: TradingView Given the strong upward momentum and successful price recovery post-retraction, if the market maintains its bullish sentiment, Ethereum could potentially break through the current resistance level.

APT holders can participate by voting on network proposals, leveraging the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. This article explores the top five platforms for users looking to buy APT, with insights into the unique features and advantages of each. BeInCrypto conducted a six-month evaluation to select the top five platforms where Aptos can be purchased. This assessment considered various factors specific to the platforms offering Aptos and other general criteria. Here are the factors evaluated for the chosen exchanges: Coinbase: Kraken: Bybit: Uphold: CoinEx To learn more about BeInCrypto’s Verification Methodilogy, follow this link. Coinbase has established itself as a leading platform in the crypto exchange market. Its extensive range of services is tailored to meet the needs of a global clientele. The platform is beginner-friendly, making it the perfect option for less-experienced users looking to buy APT with ease and without complexity. The U.S.-based platform is notably one of the most liquid regulated crypto spot exchanges in the world. Furthermore, Coinbase offers over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks in the U.S. and Europe, available to approved Coinbase Prime customers worldwide, providing a specialized service for high-volume traders. The platform also features Coinbase Custody, enhancing security for institutional clients needing to safely store large volumes of cryptocurrencies. Kraken is one of our top choices for buying and selling APT thanks to its long-standing industry reputation and wide global presence. Founded in 2011 by Jesse Powell, Kraken is among the oldest and most established crypto exchanges and operates across Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania, and South America. Kraken provides a straightforward interface and caters to all user levels. It also facilitates both margin and futures trading, catering to sophisticated traders looking to leverage their positions. Notably, the exchange is renowned for its strong focus on security. The CEX implements rigorous measures to protect user funds and provide a safe trading environment. As of 2024, the exchange has never suffered a large-scale hack, making it one of the safest choices for users looking to buy APT. Bybit is an ideal platform for users looking to buy APT, offering low spot fees (0.1% maker-taker) and high liquidity. The user-friendly CEX is well-suited for traders looking for a platform for all the bells and whistles due to its extensive leverage options and risk management tools. The exchange uniquely allows users to trade with up to 100x leverage on select assets, offering significant potential for profit amplification. It further supports trading safety with tools such as Bybit’s insurance fund, auto deleveraging, and the choice between cross and isolated margin accounts. These features collectively help manage and contain trading risks effectively. Bybit’s accessibility in over 200+ countries makes it a highly attractive option for global audiences. Uphold is an ideal platform for users looking to buy APT. The platform maintains a high level of transparency regarding its fee structure, ensuring users are fully informed about any fees and charges. Uphold’s comprehensive pricing model typically features a modest spread ranging from 0.4% to 1.0%. As well as supporting a diverse array of crypto, the platform offers users the opportunity to trade in precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum, and palladium. Furthermore, Uphold enhances the liquidity of these investments by allowing instant conversion into 27 national currencies and imposes zero custody costs. All assets, including precious metals and currencies, are spendable directly through the Uphold debit card. This combination of flexibility, low costs, and range of tradable assets makes Uphold a compelling choice for users looking to buy APT and explore other types of investment opportunities. CoinEx is an excellent platform for users looking to buy Aptos (APT) due to its user-friendly features and diverse trading options. CoinEx offers the advantage of no-KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements, allowing for quicker and more private trading. Users can effortlessly swap one cryptocurrency for another with a single click. The platform is equipped with a detailed interface for spot trading, making it accessible for both novice and advanced traders. Additionally, CoinEx supports margin trading, providing leverage ranging from three to 10x depending on the asset, which can enhance potential returns. This combination of privacy, ease of use, and flexible trading options makes CoinEx a standout choice for purchasing Aptos and other cryptocurrencies. The Aptos blockchain is an innovative layer-1 network developed by a number of the original creators of Meta’s abandoned crypto payment project, Diem. The blockchain’s stated aim is to become the safest and most scalable blockchain in the world. The blockchain employs a proof-of-stake (PoS) algorithm to validate and secure transactions across its network. PoS allows participants, known as validators or stakers, to verify transactions and create new blocks based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and are willing to “stake” as collateral. This system enhances network security while also incentivizing stakeholders to participate in the ecosystem. The web3-ready network supports both DApps and smart contracts, fostering trustless interactions and automating various processes. Additionally, Aptos employs innovative scaling solutions to ensure high throughput and low latency, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to supply chain management. Overall, the Aptos blockchain’s architecture and functionalities contribute to its efficiency, security, and scalability, positioning it as a leading force in the decentralized economy. "People are staying [on Aptos]… not only because of the tech, but because… for the first time in a while, a brand new programming language brings a new ecosystem that is more inclusive—that wants to help each other and wants to collaborate." Points were made @theempirepod 👏 https://t.co/0Q8rza0Jb5 The layer-1 blockchain implements unique technology design choices, including leveraging the Move programming language to bolster its code security and a unique Block-STM parallel execution engine to expedite transaction throughput potential. The use of Move as its native programming language ensures swift and secure transaction processing within its ecosystem. The Move prover, a formal verification tool tailored for smart contracts written in Move, enhances security measures by validating contract invariants and behaviors. This emphasis on security empowers developers with robust tools to safeguard their software against potential malicious threats, bolstering the overall integrity of the platform. Aptos launched on Oct. 18, 2022. Initially trading at 1 USDT, its value quickly soared by 10,000% after it was listed on the Binance exchange. This rapid growth ensured the coin quickly grabbed the attention of investors. The initial supply of APT at mainnet was 1 billion. The allocation was as follows: A majority of these tokens (410,217,359.767) are held by the Aptos Foundation, with a smaller portion (100,000,000) held by Aptos Labs. It is anticipated that these tokens will be distributed over a ten-year period: Do note that APT token distribution, as outlined above, is highly centralized, with staking reward unlocks that have no vesting schedule. This heightens the likeliness of venture capitalists dumping rewards on the open market, leaving unsuspecting retail investors caught short. As such, it is crucial to employ a comprehensive DYOR policy before choosing to invest in Aptos. Several crypto exchanges offer APT for purchase. This example will illustrate how to buy on CoinEx, a popular non-KYC exchange. 2. Fund your account: If your balance is zero, you’ll need to buy a cryptocurrency that can be exchanged for APT, such as USDT. 3. Find APT: Enter “APT” in the search bar at the top of the page. Click on it, and choose the “Swap” Option. 4. Enter the amount of USDT you plan to convert and click “Swap.” The system will automatically calculate the amount of APT you will receive based on the current market rate. Review all the transaction details carefully, confirm your information, and proceed to finalize the trade. The best platform for buying APT depends on individual needs and preferences. These factors include security, user interface, trading options, and geographical availability. Coinbase is celebrated for its strong regulatory compliance and beginner-friendly interface. Kraken provides extensive trading options and advanced security. Bybit is favored for high-leverage trading opportunities, whereas Uphold allows trading in cryptocurrencies and precious metals. Finally, CoinEx is preferred by those seeking privacy with its no-KYC policy. Note that each platform has its strengths and potential drawbacks. Remember to conduct due diligence and do your own research (DYOR) before investing in Aptos (APT). To buy Aptos (APT), you must create an account on a cryptocurrency exchange that lists APT, such as Coinbase, Kraken, Bybit, CoinEx, or Uphold. Once your account is set up and verified, you can deposit funds using bank transfer, credit card, or e-wallets. Aptos is listed on several major cryptocurrency exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken, Bybit, CoinEx, and Uphold. These platforms provide various trading pairs for Aptos, allowing you to trade them against cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and sometimes fiat currencies. The APT coin, the native cryptocurrency of the Aptos blockchain, was launched in October 2022. The launch followed significant interest and backing from various stakeholders in the cryptocurrency community, marking it as a notable event in the crypto calendar. Whether Aptos is better than Solana depends on specific criteria such as transaction speed, scalability, security, and developer community. Aptos claims high transaction throughput and scalability, but Solana is also renowned for its speed and efficiency. Aptos Labs, a team composed of former Meta (Facebook) employees who worked on the Diem blockchain project, is behind Aptos crypto. This team aims to create a highly scalable and usable blockchain, leveraging their experience developing blockchain solutions at a large scale. You can stake Aptos on exchanges that support staking functionalities, such as Kraken. This platform allows users to participate in staking directly through their trading accounts, providing a smooth way to earn rewards on holdings. However, offerings can change for other platforms, so it’s always a good idea to check the latest updates directly on each platform’s website or through customer support. The staking rate for Aptos can vary depending on the platform and market conditions. Generally, staking rewards are influenced by factors such as the total amount of APT staked on the network and the inflation rate set by the Aptos protocol. It’s important to check current rates on the platform where you intend to stake your APT. Comparing Aptos to Ethereum involves looking at transaction capacity, smart contract capabilities, and overall ecosystem. While Ethereum has a much larger and more established ecosystem with extensive developer support, Aptos offers promising technological advancements that could lead to higher throughput and efficiency. Each has its strengths, making them suitable for different use cases.

66::https://blockworks.co/news/blockchain-ai-misleading-narrative::Blockworks::article::What can blockchain do for AI? Not what you’ve heard.::Opinion: AI and blockchain put together aren’t actually that good at combating misinformation and improving privacy just yet.::In reality, many of the oft-touted uses for bringing blockchain and AI together aren’t actually all that useful Stokkete/Modified by Blockworks Industries everywhere are asking “What can AI do for us?” But the blockchain industry, known for challenging norms, is also asking the opposite question: “What can blockchain do for AI?” While there are some compelling answers, three narratives have emerged around this question that are frequently misleading and, in one case, potentially even hazardous. An expert panel at a recent Coinbase event concluded that “blockchain can counter misinformation with cryptographic digital signatures and timestamps, making it clear what’s authentic and what’s been manipulated.” This is true only in a very narrow sense. Blockchains can record digital-media creation in a tamper-proof way, i.e., so that modification of specific images is detectible. But this is a far cry from clarifying authenticity. Consider a photo of a flying saucer hovering above the Washington Monument. Suppose that someone has registered its creation in, say, block 20,000,000 of the Ethereum blockchain. This fact tells you one thing: The flying saucer image was created before block 20,000,000. Additionally, whoever posted the image to the blockchain — let’s call her Alice — did so by digitally signing a transaction. Assuming that Alice’s signing key wasn’t stolen, it’s clear that Alice registered the photo on the blockchain. None of this, however, tells you how the image was created. It might be a photo that Alice snapped with her own camera. Or Alice might have gotten the image from Bob, who Photoshopped it. Or maybe Carol created it with a generative AI tool. In short, the blockchain tells you nothing about whether aliens were touring Washington, D.C.—unless you already trust Alice to begin with. Some cameras can digitally sign photos to authenticate them (assuming their sensors can’t be fooled, which is a big if), but this isn’t blockchain technology. Model training is a data-hungry operation. The bigger and better the training data set, the better the resulting model. For many applications, training on private user data is essential. For instance, creating a good machine-learning model to diagnose medical conditions requires data from a population of real patients. Handling such highly sensitive data securely is a challenge. Some are trumpeting blockchain technologies as a solution. Blockchains, however, are designed for transparency — a property at odds with confidentiality. Proponents point to privacy-enhancing technologies advanced by the blockchain industry to address this tension — especially zero-knowledge proofs. Zero-knowledge proofs, however, don’t solve the problem of privacy in AI model training. That’s because a zero-knowledge proof doesn’t conceal secrets from whoever is constructing the proof. Zero-knowledge proofs are helpful if I want to conceal my transaction data from you. But they don’t enable me to compute privately over your data. There are other, more relevant cryptographic and security tools with esoteric names, including fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), secure multiparty computation (MPC) and secure enclaves. These can in principle support privacy-preserving AI (specifically, “federated learning”). Each has important caveats, though. And claiming them as blockchain-specific technologies would be a stretch. Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, has noted that bots are already performing transactions using cryptocurrency and tweeted that “AI and Blockchains are made for each other.” This is true in the sense that cryptocurrency is a good match for the capabilities of AI agents. But it’s also worrisome. Many people fret about AI agents escaping human control. Classic nightmare scenarios involve autonomous vehicles killing people or AI-powered autonomous weapons going rogue. But there’s another vector of escape: The financial system. Money equals power. Give that power to an AI agent and it can do real damage. This problem is the topic of a research paper that I co-authored in 2015/6. My colleagues and I examined the possibility of smart contracts, programs that autonomously intermediate transactions on Ethereum, being used to facilitate crime. Using the techniques in that paper and a blockchain oracle system with access to LLMs (Large Language Models) such as ChatGPT, bad actors could in principle launch “rogue” smart contracts that automatically pay bounties for committing serious crimes. Read more from our opinion section: How a smart contract gets away with murder: A review of ‘The Oracle’ Happily, rogue smart contracts of this kind aren’t yet possible in today’s blockchains — but the blockchain industry and crypto enthusiasts will need to take AI safety seriously as a future concern. They will need to consider mitigations, such as community-driven interventions or guardrails in oracles to help enforce AI safety. The integration of blockchains and AI does hold clear promise. AI may add unprecedented flexibility to blockchain systems by creating natural language interfaces to them. Blockchains may provide new financial and transparency frameworks for model training and data sourcing and put the power of AI in the hands of communities, not just enterprises.

Share this article GameStop stocks GME triggered a circuit breaker today after a 54% rise, according to multiple reports. The volatility is tied to the return of RoaringKitty on X this Monday, after a nearly three-year hiatus from public apparitions, as reported by Crypto Briefing. $GME Paused due to volatility x4 (+90%) — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) May 13, 2024 Keith Gill, RoaringKitty’s real name, is largely credited for spiking the GameStop stock surge in late 2020. Gill worked as a financial analyst, became convinced that GameStop stock was undervalued, and shared this belief on X and YouTube using the handle RoaringKitty. Meanwhile, meme coins on Solana tied to GameStop and RoaringKitty show large leaps in price in the last six hours. GaemStap (GME), a meme coin surfing the trend of misspelling names, has risen by 1,957% at the time of writing. Kith gil (GIL), a token referencing RoaringKitty’s real name, leaped 1,960% in the same period. DeepF*ckingValue (ROAR), another one of Gill’s pseudonyms, jumped 1,264% and is also among the Solana meme coins with stellar rises in the past six hours. RoaringKitty (KITTY), however, shows the most significant leap of the bunch after showing an 11,045% growth.

69::https://theconversation.com/when-china-and-other-big-countries-launch-cryptocurrencies-it-will-kick-off-a-global-revolution-128678::The Conversation::article::When China and other big countries launch cryptocurrencies, it will kick off a global revolution::Stand by for cryptocurrencies 2.0.::One of the hottest topics in cryptocurrencies is the prospect of major economies launching state-backed digital coins. China’s central bank recently accelerated plans for what is currently known as the Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP). It could launch within the next 18 months, while the European Central Bank is looking at something similar. Meanwhile, Russia has been working on a state-backed cryptoruble for several years, and Sweden has its e-krona project. Indeed, several countries have got there already: Senegal and the tiny Marshall Islands now have digital coins that sit alongside their existing currencies, while others such as Venezuela and Ecuador have tried but failed to gain traction. Make no mistake, these developments will completely change the international monetary system. Today’s system dates to the Bretton Woods conference of 1944, in which to create a stable trading environment the Allied nations agreed to peg their currencies to the US dollar and the US agreed to peg the dollar to gold. The dollar has been at the heart of the monetary system ever since, despite Bretton Woods being gradually replaced by free-floating exchange rates after the dollar/gold commitment was abandoned by the Americans in the 1970s. Today, around 40% of international payments and 60% of the world’s total foreign exchange reserves are in US dollars. The euro takes a more minor but still considerable proportion: over 30% of international payments and 20% of reserves. All other currencies are trivial by comparison. American financial dominance means that the Federal Reserve almost acts as the central bank of the world, since whatever its monetary policy committee decides to do with dollar interest rates has huge consequences everywhere. Together with the dollar’s dominance of the SWIFT international payment system, this was pivotal in maintaining the international monetary order for years by reducing transaction costs and speeding up globalisation. In recent years, however, the picture has changed. With heightened tensions between the world’s major powers, many commentators increasingly accuse the Americans of playing the system to their own economy’s advantage without proper regard for the consequences further afield. There are also serious concerns about the US using international payments as a political tool, for instance by leaning on SWIFT to exclude Iranian banks over the uranium enrichment row – despite objections even from the EU. Arguably, dollar dominance is now hindering the deepening of globalisation. Many countries are making moves that are changing this situation, however. The UK, France and Germany have set up INSTEX as an alternative means of trading with Iran, for instance, and six other EU countries have recently joined. There has been a massive rise in the number of bilateral agreements between central banks that allow two countries to swap currencies directly, a large number involving China. Meanwhile, a number of countries, including Germany and the Netherlands, have been repatriating their gold reserves from vaults in the US where they had long been stored. Yet by comparison, major sovereign digital currencies based on blockchain technology would be revolutionary. Blockchains are encrypted ledgers for storing information that are decentralised rather than being under any country’s or company’s control. When applied to international payments, this offers the prospect of much more transparent and cheaper transactions than SWIFT. It could cut the payments time lag from a couple of days to one second, and the cost from 0.01% to almost nothing. It will have the capacity to handle far higher volumes of payments, partly since they won’t require bank accounts or even internet access. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and XRP have been a good experiment in using blockchains for international payments. Yet when countries issue equivalents of their own, these will have even more advantages. They will be backed by states, and completely decentralised cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin will not be able to compete with this. While technological change has been incredibly fast in the information era, the system of international payments has lagged behind. But once sovereign digital currencies start taking off, this will suddenly change. Just like smartphones quickly eliminated most old cell phones, no countries will be able to reject blockchain payments for long. So while, for example, the US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin recently said that his country does not see itself launching a digital dollar in the next five years, there will be a moment when the political centre of gravity will shift and everyone will join the revolution. After the 5G network and the Internet of Things really mushroom in the next couple of years, it will be possible to replace the existing system even faster. This will be the beginning of a new international monetary era. Instead of passively accepting US dollars as settlement currency in international trade, buyers and sellers will be able to choose freely from a variety of currencies. We are also likely to see a series of new powerful regional currencies, along with opportunities for the currencies of small countries with high credibility and advanced financial industries. Countries and their central banks will be competing freely with one another in this market, knowing that if they implement policies that devalue their currency, international traders will just choose rival currencies instead. Beyond that, countries will form cryptocurrency unions to regulate currencies and platforms, standardise technology and maintain the stability of the system. New clearing systems will emerge, along with new financial products. In short, it will be a whole new user-centred financial ecosystem. Whenever there are innovations in payment methods, there always follows a surge in demand. China’s Alipay and WeChat Pay are good examples. More recently we are seeing similar explosive demand for the likes of Apple Pay and Amazon Go. Yet these are primarily domestic stories. Sovereign digital currencies should produce a surge in international trade and cooperation. There will be new economic growth as more small players join the global market and consumers enjoy a wider range of goods and services at lower costs. This may seem threatening to those who benefit from the existing system, but it will be more than outweighed by capitalising on what comes next. The question for different countries is whether they embrace change or try and defend the status quo. As Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg told American lawmakers in response to China’s DCEP plan, “while we debate these issues, the rest of the world isn’t waiting”. The sooner countries shift, the better placed they are likely to be for what lies ahead.::2019-12-12T12:07:54Z::Bitcoin, Blockchain, Bretton Woods, China, Cryptocurrency, Facebook, Iran, Libra, US dollar, international monetary system, stablecoin::Liang Zhao::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/306575/original/file-20191212-85367-1uu5emz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

The “move to earn” project brought $26 million in Q1, as previously reported. Move-to-earn, similar to play-to-earn, is a model whereby users are rewarded in cryptocurrency for their step count on the STEPN application. STEPN said it would leverage 5% of the profits to initiate a buyback and burn program for its native GMT tokens. It added that the buyback and burn process “may take a few weeks to complete” in order to avoid causing sudden price volatility. “In addition to the buyback and burn program, STEPN will allocate capital reserves to improve upon existing features and build out the team,” developers said. STEPN said the team had identified several areas where the company will deploy its earned capital in order to improve game play. These include security enhancements, anti-cheating mechanisms to prevent bots from earning GMT, building the developer and core team and seeking out partnerships and/or sponsorship opportunities. GMT prices rose nominally following the earnings release. The tokens traded at 85 cents at press time, and are down 71% from April’s all-time high of $4.11.

All You Need to Know::Solana's memecoin craze, Bonk, promises big gains. But can it bark its way to long-term success? Dive in, HODLers, and discover BONK's potential (and pitfalls) in 2024! ::Solana’s memecoin craze, Bonk, promises big gains. But can it bark its way to long-term success? Dive in, HODLers, and discover BONK’s potential (and pitfalls) in 2024! Bonk Coin (BONK), the meme-tastic token of the Solana (SOL) blockchain, has captured attention with its explosive growth and vibrant community. But with meme coins notorious for volatility, investors are left asking: Is Bonk Coin a good investment gem or a fleeting pump-and-dump? This guide dives deep into BONK’s intricacies, exploring its potential, risks, and price analysis to help you navigate the hype and make informed investment decisions. Buckle up for a journey into the wild world of meme coins, where barking loudly doesn’t always guarantee success. BONK is self-termed as the “first Solana dog coin for the people by the people.” But how does that reflect on the investment front? Let’s find out! BONK was launched amid low sentiment in the Solana community due to the FTX collapse. The initial development of the project kicked off in the middle of 2022. On December 25, 2022, half of the total supply of BONK was distributed as an airdrop to the community members of the Solana ecosystem. Over the short time it has been live, BONK has quickly gained momentum, attracting over 619,000 unique holders. Currently, it is listed on more than 30 exchanges. This demonstrates its appeal and growing influence within the cryptocurrency space. BonkSwap was launched in April 2023 as an independently owned automated market maker (AMM) decentralized exchange (DEX) platform to expand the ecosystem further. It has a current total value locked (TVL) of 2.8 million, as reported by DefiLlama. BONK has established itself as the third-largest meme coin in the cryptocurrency market, trailing behind the renowned Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), according to CoinMarketCap data. It also holds a position among the top 100 cryptocurrencies globally, highlighting its significant presence within the digital asset landscape. As of the latest figures, BONK boasted a market capitalization of $811,705,546. The 24-hour trading volume stood at $85,783,812, showcasing considerable activity and investor interest. In terms of its token metrics, BONK revealed a circulating supply of 63,333,513,043,628 tokens, accounting for approximately 67.72% of its total supply. Bonk Coin price history – Image via TradingView Since the onset of 2024, BONK has navigated through significant bearish challenges. It was initially undervalued in the first week of January. This suggested a potential for price appreciation. Subsequently, a surge propelled the price to its peak resistance at $0.000016 within the analyzed timeframe. However, this peak was followed by a rejection, initiating a downtrend that persisted until the price found support at $0.0000098, preventing further declines. As February progressed, there was another bullish attempt to elevate the price beyond the resistance at $0.000012. Despite crossing this threshold, the price failed to sustain above the higher resistance level of $0.000013, resulting in another dip. At the time of writing, BONK was trading at $0.0000128, edging closer to its support level at $0.000012. Over the past week, BONK’s price has declined by 1.4%, with an approximate 3% decrease observed in the last 24 hours. This indicated that selling pressure has intensified, potentially due to investors taking profits or reacting to broader market conditions. The asset’s performance was reflected in its indicators. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) exited the oversold territory in the second week of January, staying below the midpoint of 50 until after the first week of February. The February rally marked a positive shift in the market, evidenced by the RSI reaching 61.03 mid-month, coinciding with the price momentarily surpassing $0.000013. However, the RSI fell to 51.52 following the price decline, suggesting a weakening of bullish momentum. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator also showed interesting movements, entering positive territory as BONK tested its peak resistance. Despite a dip below zero by the end of January, it rebounded in February, with its current value at 0.08. The trading volume mirrored these market dynamics, starting low and increasing with the price surge in January. However, it declined following the downturn and, despite a slight recovery in February, has not reached the peak levels observed during the initial surge. The recent price rejection was again accompanied by a decrease in trading volume, indicating a cautious market sentiment. Should I buy Bonk Coin? – Image via TradingView Reviewing the overall performance of the BONK, it reached its all-time high (ATH) in December 2023, a milestone that aligned with its listing on Coinbase—a phenomenon often referred to as the “Coinbase effect.” This event significantly boosted the token’s price, underlining its legitimacy and expanding its visibility due to Coinbase’s extensive user base. Despite this peak, the token’s value has seen a decline since. However, the market still showed a hint of bullish sentiment. Over the last month, the token appreciated by approximately 10%, and it has seen an impressive year-over-year increase of about 1300%. This performance is considered favorable for the token. Looking ahead, as BONK approaches its current support level, the asset’s ability to sustain or rebound from this point could signal its short-term trajectory and investor confidence in its value stabilization or potential for recovery. Moreover, if the bulls can sustain a rally and break through the resistance level at $0.000016, BONK could potentially be closer to approaching its ATH once more. Achieving this would necessitate a significant shift in market dynamics alongside positive developments that could foster a strong buying sentiment within the market. For 2024, a speculative yet optimistic target price for BONK could be $0.00002, assuming the sentiment in the market shifts favorably. Conversely, a reversal to bearish sentiment could see the price falling back to its lowest support level, posing a critical challenge for the bulls to uphold the support level and avert further declines. While initially dismissed as a mere memecoin, BONK is actively building an ecosystem to increase its utility. This includes: Factors to consider before investing in BONK Since its debut, the project has been progressing with significant development and engagement from the core BONK contributors. You’re encouraged to delve into all the features this memecoin project offers by visiting the website provided. Among the standout features of BONK crypto are: BONKSwap:  BONKBot:  Another noteworthy accomplishment of this memecoin project is its expansion across various chains. As of the latest update, BONK is accessible on ten different blockchain networks, including Ethereum. Bonk stands out with several distinctive features: As we conclude our exploration of Bonk Coin’s potential as a long-term investment in 2024, it becomes evident that while it presents certain opportunities, it also carries inherent risks. Its technological innovations, market dynamics, and community support all play pivotal roles in shaping its trajectory. However, the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies underscores the importance of conducting thorough research and exercising caution. Ultimately, whether Bonk Coin is deemed a good long-term investment hinges on individual risk tolerance, investment goals, and the ability to adapt to the ever-changing landscape of the digital asset market. In the realm of cryptocurrencies, informed decision-making remains paramount, paving the way for a resilient and profitable investment journey.

To learn more on how we evaluate each piece of content, please proceed to our verification methodology page YakDAO offers opportunities for average retail investors to gain crypto and real estate exposure via recreational glamping properties. So, how does it work, and is this the start of a broader real estate tokenization movement? Read on to find out in this comprehensive YakDAO guide. Yak is an eco-friendly, recreational camping site. Campers enjoy luxury camping, also known as glamping. With a location currently in Brevard, North Carolina, Yak has plans to expand to other sites as its platform grows. Notably, Yak’s camping sites are sustainable. The aim is to positively contribute to the surroundings while minimizing environmental impact as much as possible. As a result, Yak offers a unique and comfortable outdoor experience for those who want to enjoy nature without sacrificing modern amenities and a luxury touch. YakDAO is a fractionalized investment platform built around Yak services. It is a recreational property decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Anyone can invest in YakDAO to earn profits from Yak. David Woodbury founded YakDAO and is the current CEO. Woodbury has over 10 years of experience as a C-level executive, creating startups, raising millions in venture funding, and, crucially, building outdoor recreation and property management software. This innovative platform also has a list of notable sponsors and integrations, many of which are recognizable within the crypto and traditional finance (TradFi) spaces. Some of these include: The nexus of the YakDAO platform is the democratized ownership of the recreational properties offered by Yak. This model allows the average retail investor to gain exposure to a traditionally gate-kept process. The entire investment process begins with the Treasury. YakDAO gathers contributions from community members who receive Yak DAO (YAKS) in return. The DAO purchases unique outdoor recreational properties using the funds collected from the community treasury. YakDAO then develops and maintains these properties for commercial and community use. The total supply of YAKS is 100,000,000. It is a governance token on the Arbitrum blockchain, which allows customers to take advantage of relatively low fees and fast transaction confirmation times. 💰💡 Let's look at the tokenomics of $YAKS and unveil how it maintains its value within the YakDAO ecosystem! 💰💡 📊 Tokenomics Total Supply – 100 00 000 Initial Market Cap – $236 500 Fully Diluted Market Cap – $5 500 000 TGE Token Price – $0.055 💹 Value Maintenance: $YAKS… pic.twitter.com/BC07qIMEPA There are three primary ways that the YAKS token maintains its value to support the YakDAO ecosystem: 30% of the revenue generated by the properties goes into YAKS buybacks to fund staking pools. A percentage will also be used to buy back and burn YAKS, further enhancing the token’s value. Where we see finance/funds being the barrier to tokenizing all aspects of real world assets, what YakDAO was able to do with real world tangible assets, was to buy a property for a DAO, monetize with short term rentals and create token buybacks tied to DAO revenue. We believe this model is scalable and has many potential use cases. Stakers will not only earn more YAKS but can also earn NFTs, win free nights at the glamping property, and attend YAK Fest. Furthermore, invitations to the Governance Committee will be extended to top-tier token holders. 1. Obtain a web3 wallet: Before purchasing YAKS, you must first obtain a web3 wallet. Download a wallet and follow the instructions to secure it. Login and switch over to the Arbitrum blockchain to begin purchasing YAKS. We’ve used MetaMask in this example. 2. Go to Uniswap: Uniswap is the official decentralized exchange (DEX) earmarked for purchasing YAKS. Any other DEX offering YAKS may be a scam, so it is best only to use official platforms designated by the YaksDAO team. 3. Select the YAKS token: Make sure you are on the Arbitrum blockchain and have some crypto (e.g., ETH) to swap for YAKS. Search for the official Yak DAO token address in the Uniswap search bar. 4. Buy Yak DAO (YAKS): Select the amount of YAKS that you would like to purchase. Press confirm. You have officially purchased YAKS and can stake, trade, or participate in YakDAO governance. The benefits of YakDAO are clear. It uses real-world assets (RWA) to give back to its community while simultaneously using its community to bootstrap the ecosystem, similar to a feedback loop. This helps to create a sustainable and self-sufficient decentralized organization. The project offers a clear roadmap for investors and has thus far (as of May 2024) delivered on its promises. With many big-name investors on board, YakDAO presents a credible offering that aims to return a profit to investors but also build community. Included in the project plans are in-person events, including annual YAK Fest meet-ups, bringing together the Governance Committee and top YAK stakers. YakDAO offers a clear opportunity. Its journey from concept to tangible achievements in less than a year since launch demonstrates the strength of the project’s trajectory. However, investors should be aware that crypto investments are high-risk. Tokenization comes with its own barriers, particularly regulatory uncertainty and an education gap. While the YakDAO project is widening accessibility for investors who may not otherwise consider or be able to invest in property, it must be highlighted that profits are not guaranteed with any investment. Finally, as of May 2024, the YAKS token can only be traded on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). While DEXs offer the benefit of anonymity, they are less secure platforms than their centralized counterparts. Moreover, they often offer lower liquidity than CEXs and a steeper learning curve for new users. This may counteract YakDAO’s mission to widen investment accessibility, at least in the short term. Real estate tokenization is set to revolutionize how we invest in and manage real estate assets, making them more accessible and efficient. The $YAK token offers investors a chance to invest in tangible, real-world assets while benefiting from the power of decentralized finance. The project represents one exciting tenet of an overall trend toward the democratization of such investments. Tokenization offers the sector increased liquidity and transparency, thus making it more accessible to the average person. In all, it’s clear that YAKDAO is at the forefront of an industry poised for massive growth. Remember to always DYOR, and never invest more than you can afford. YakDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization that governs the Yak platform. Yak is an eco-friendly recreational property that allows customers to enjoy the outdoors without giving up amenities. The DAO governs Yak and allows retail investors to benefit from the profits made from Yak. YakDAO collects money from the community to purchase and develop properties for glamping. Investors receive the YAKS token in return. Then YakDAO engages in market operations to further enhance the value of the YAKS token to incentivize holders to hold. YakDAO allows the average investor to gain exposure to investment activities traditionally reserved for accredited investors. Customers can have fractionalized exposure to investment properties without actively maintaining the properties. Furthermore, YAKS holders may have the possibility to earn NFTs, participate in governance, or utilize the glamping facilities. Yes, there are some risks associated with real estate tokenization. Due to the fact that cryptocurrency and blockchain technology are still niche sectors, there are some regulatory risks that may not be immediately apparent. The real estate market is also volatile and illiquid, therefore, allowing access to retail customers who may not understand expose them to some risks. To invest in YakDAO, you will need a cryptocurrency wallet and some cryptocurrency to purchase YAKS. The Yak DAO token is on Uniswap on the Arbitrum blockchain, so you will need Arbitrum ETH to buy some. You should only use the official YakDAO website to learn how to purchase YAKS. Yak has plans to purchase and develop more property in the future. There are also plans for a multichain staking pool and a Mogul Rewards Engine. Lastly, there are plans to launch YakLAND shares by 2025.

The NCLA, TBC, and Riot were granted a 14-day temporary restraining order late Friday, blocking the DOE and the Energy Information Administration from requiring bitcoin mining companies to hand over information as part of an emergency survey the EIA announced earlier this year. Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council, told Blockworks that the TBC remains “confident that we have a sound legal case.” “We’re concerned that a benign agency like the Energy Information Administration would be politicized in this way, it doesn’t bode well for other industries that potentially could fall out of favor with the administration and power,” he added. The complaint, filed last week, said that miners would be “irreparably harmed” by the survey, which demanded “confidential, sensitive and proprietary information.” “We will specifically focus on how the energy demand for cryptocurrency mining is evolving, identify geographic areas of high growth, and quantify the sources of electricity used to meet cryptocurrency mining demand,” Joe DeCarolis, administrator for the EIA, said in a statement last month. Read more: Crypto miner ire over EIA survey bubbles over to the courtroom The request, which was filed as an emergency order earlier this month, came after the cold snap that impacted parts of the US. “Given the emerging and rapidly changing nature of this issue and because EIA cannot quantitatively assess the likelihood of public harm, EIA felt a sense of urgency to generate credible data that would provide insight into this unfolding issue,” an EIA spokesperson told Blockworks back in early February. The NCLA, in a press release Friday, said that the EIA “appears to be responding to political pressure rather than a genuine ‘emergency’ implicating public harm.” In the order granting the TRO, the court wrote that it believed that the plaintiffs are “likely” to show that the justification for the emergency order request fell “short.” Before the order, the EIA — on its website and on X — clarified that it wouldn’t be enforcing the survey until March 22. Bratcher told Blockworks that TBC is “in this [fight] for our members and the industry and have no inclination to back away from what we think is a very correct cause.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

74::https://coinatory.com/cryptocurrency-news/ark-invest-and-21shares-amend-ethereum-etf-proposal-exclude-staking-feature-18929/::Coinatory::article::ARK Invest and 21Shares Amend Ethereum ETF Proposal, Exclude Staking Feature::ARK Invest and 21Shares have revised their Ethereum ETF proposal, removing the staking feature and shifting to a cash-creation model, aligning with SEC regulations and reflecting recent crypto ETF trends.::ARK Invest and 21Shares have revised their proposal for an Ethereum-based exchange-traded fund (ETF), opting to exclude the cryptocurrency staking feature from their plan. This adjustment was made following productive negotiations with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which have led the firms to adopt a cash creation and redemption model for the ETF. Initially, the firms had considered an in-kind redemption approach, where payments were made non-monetarily using Ether. However, the revised strategy now involves purchasing Ether in amounts corresponding to the order placed and depositing it with a custodian, which will facilitate the creation of ETF shares. In their latest regulatory filing on May 10, the section that previously suggested 21Shares would engage third-party providers to stake a portion of the fund’s assets was omitted. The earlier filing on February 7 had outlined plans for receiving Ethereum staking rewards, which were to be recognized as income generated by the fund. Eric Balchunas, a cryptocurrency analyst at Bloomberg, commented on the development via social media, noting, “ARK/21Shares has just filed an amended S-1 for their spot Ether ETF, updating it to feature only cash creations among other adjustments that align it with the recently approved spot BTC ETF prospectus.” Despite these changes, the filing retains comprehensive discussions on risks associated with staking, such as potential losses from slashing penalties, the temporary inaccessibility of funds during bonding and non-bonding periods, and the possible effects on Ethereum’s market price. The regulatory pathway for launching a spot Ethereum ETF has been fraught with delays. Following the pattern of their previously approved spot Bitcoin ETF, ARK Invest and 21Shares adjusted their application on February 8, signaling a shift toward a cash-creation model. This strategic pivot aims to align the Ether ETF closely with the SEC’s demonstrated regulatory preferences. As the SEC deliberates over various spot Ether ETF applications, including those from notable firms such as Invesco Galaxy, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, VanEck, and BlackRock, the crypto investment landscape is poised for potential shifts. These could enhance institutional involvement and the mainstream acceptance of Ethereum as an investable asset. Notably, other major players like Fidelity and Grayscale are incorporating staking features into their Ethereum ETF applications, seeking to capitalize on staking rewards within a regulated framework and offering investors additional income opportunities. However, U.S. legislators continue to scrutinize cryptocurrency ETFs, citing substantial investor risks. The SEC’s decisions in the coming weeks, particularly on the applications from VanEck and ARK Invest/21Shares, will be critical in shaping the future of cryptocurrency investments and regulatory practices. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

75::https://cryptobriefing.com/base-trading-surge-jojo-dex/::Crypto Briefing::article::Base records 212% increase in perpetual trading volumes::JOJO DEX's dominance in Base's ecosystem signals a strong user engagement trend.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Base is the blockchain with the most significant monthly and weekly perpetual trading volume growth among the 10 largest chains in total value locked (TVL), according to data aggregator DefiLlama. This weekly jump can be attributed to the recently launched perpetual decentralized exchange (perp DEX) JOJO, which has presented a nearly 75% growth in trading volume for the past seven days.  Moreover, JOJO dominated 61% of Base perpetual trading volume over the last 24 hours, surpassing $95 million. Jotaro Kujo, JOJO’s co-founder, shared that there are “quite a lot of real users” trading perpetual contracts.  “I believe someone is farming the airdrops since every project that doesn’t have launched a token will make people somehow believe that they will give airdrops to the early users. But from our market-making results, they are not just wasting their trading fees, they are earning money. Farmers’ activity is just opening and closing positions, paying a lot of gas fees and trading fees to make their total trading volume a big number,” he explained.  Kujo adds that real users are not seen just on JOJO’s platform but on the Base ecosystem as a whole, and that’s why the team chose their infrastructure to build a perp DEX. Despite Arbitrum and Blast having a larger derivatives volume, Base offers engaged users, a significant amount of TVL, and fast growth, he adds.  “Most of Base activity is real. People are there to use it, not just farm it. Another thing we really like, and we think can create a loyal user base in the long term is Coinbase itself. They put a lot of work into making Base easy to use: they have a very strong infrastructure, including sequencers, the bridge, and also oracles. They also made a lot of things to connect Coinbase to Base.”  Furthermore, JOJO is currently only available on Base, and Kujo revealed the team is not planning to go multichain right now. Despite internal discussions among the team, JOJO will focus its development on Base and build a relationship within the ecosystem.  “We want to make the product useful, focus on a very narrow user base to pay a lot of attention to it, and it is impossible if we deploy on five different layer-2 blockchains. As a new startup, we need to focus and avoid a lot of noise from the outside world,” Kujo concludes.

76::https://theconversation.com/blockchains-first-revolutionary-product-could-be-online-id-128028::The Conversation::article::Blockchain’s first revolutionary product could be online ID::PayPal CEO Dan Schulman sees much more potential in blockchain ID than payments at present. He’s absolutely right.::In an interview, PayPal’s chief executive, Dan Schulman, recently discussed the prospects for blockchain – the encrypted, decentralised online ledger system that underpins Bitcoin and myriad other cutting-edge projects. While talking about blockchain’s potential for improving how people make payments around the world, Schulman said: Schulman was referencing a debate around payments that has been going for a few years. Without getting too technical, the main benefits of blockchain payments are that they are not controlled by middlemen, so there are no fees to pay; and transactions can’t be hacked and changed once they are on the ledger. But at the same time, they are not yet as quick at processing transactions as the traditional system – which as Schulman argues, is fast enough in any case. Regulation is also a major issue: people on either end of a blockchain payment are completely anonymous. This presents major issues for everything from money laundering to being able to reclaim payments if you accidentally credit the wrong address. In short, blockchain-based payments technology is very easy, but policy and regulation are much harder. For PayPal, which relies on the international banking system, there is still no contest. So why was Schulman much more bullish about the prospects for blockchain around online identity? Interestingly, it relates to one of the technology’s weaknesses in payments: anonymity. Much of the cybercrime that takes place results from the fact that we don’t know who we’re talking to. If we could all encrypt our online identities on blockchains so that we could completely trust who were are dealing with, it could overcome this problem. This isn’t just theory: there are numerous interesting developments in the offing. Take the UK government, which like many countries is increasingly moving interactions with the public online. This includes benefits, taxation and other services such as passport and driving licence applications. Yet like all governments, it faces a major challenge from the fact that citizens lack a unique online identifier. This is helping fraudsters to steal nearly £50 billion worth of government services every year in the UK. For this reason, the government is currently exploring blockchain as a potential solution. Another very interesting application, currently being explored by the UK government as part of the same project, is voting systems. Blockchains could provide a way of guaranteeing that every person queuing up to vote is who they say they are – or allow people to vote online, potentially with big benefits to turnout. Australia is looking at idea this, too, having recently trialled allowing voters in South Australia to identify themselves via blockchain technology for a minor council election. Meanwhile, New South Wales conducted a trial earlier in 2019 using a blockchain for identity verification based on people’s driving licences. It enabled participants to prove their identity and age for things like buying alcohol and gambling without the need for a physical ID card. The trials concluded that the technology is not yet mature enough, and that ID-verification can still be achieved better with current technologies. Nonetheless, New South Wales is going ahead with a new large-scale trial of a driver licence registration system based on a blockchain platform at the end of 2019, covering some 140,000 licence holders. Another country to watch closely is China. It sees blockchain products as a good mechanism for regulation. Given the huge market that China represents, if the government decides to sanction (or indeed mandate) the use of online identity underpinned by blockchain it will give a phenomenal boost to the technology. It also raises the worrying prospect of the government being able to monitor all the purchasing transactions of its citizens, were it to introduce a system in which it knew the identities of everyone on the blockchain. Numerous blue-chip tech companies are vying to be part of this blockchain ID future – pointing to the potential for a very big market. IBM is trialling the “alpha” version of IBM Verify Credentials, an ID system underpinned by blockchain technology aimed at both businesses and governments. If typical software industry production cycles for large projects are anything to go by, a market-ready product could be two to three years away. Microsoft, too, is developing blockchain identity systems based on its well established and very successful Azure cloud computing platform. Either of these systems could potentially provide the kinds of services that governments are starting to envisage. As for corporate clients, one application could be online retail, which attracts a lot of cybercrime. These systems might provide a reliable means of identifying a buyer to confirm they are authorised to pay. Presumably this would be underpinned by something akin to transaction fees per payment. Given the hundreds of billions of transactions that take place every day, the potential revenues could clearly be enormous. This is why companies like PayPal cannot stay on the sidelines. Blockchain hype or not, you don’t want to be the Kodak of this industry, if or when encrypted ID becomes the next killer online technology. Until governments of major economies around the world are prepared to significantly overhaul financial systems to accept cryptocurrencies as mainstream payment methods, the less glamorous business of taking an ID-verification cut from billions of payment transactions might be the safer bet. And since this is very similar to the fee-taking business model that made PayPal a giant, it will be very interesting to see what Schulman does next.::2019-11-29T15:15:48Z::Australia, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, Cybercrime, Global perspectives, IBM, Microsoft, PayPal, SWIFT payment system::Lucian Tipi::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/304449/original/file-20191129-95226-wwnfc6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=16%2C363%2C5407%2C2703&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
77::https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/07/11/coinflex-begins-arbitration-against-84m-delinquent-customer-flex-holders-in-focus/::CoinDesk::article::CoinFLEX Begins Arbitration to Recover $84M in Delinquent Debt::The trading platform also said it was speaking with depositors looking to help the business by “rolling some of their deposits into equity.”::Crypto trading platform CoinFLEX has begun arbitration for the recovery of over $84 million in debt owed by a “large individual customer” as part of a broader revival strategy. “We have commenced arbitration in HKIAC (Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre) for the recovery of this $84 million as the individual had a legal obligation under the agreement to pay and has refused to do so,” CoinFLEX said in a post on Saturday. “His liability to pay is a personal liability, which means the individual is personally liable to pay the total amount, so our lawyers are very confident that we can enforce the award against him.” CoinFLEX suspended withdrawals last month after a certain individual’s account went into negative equity during June’s market volatility, affecting its balances. The individual was revealed by CoinFLEX CEO Mark Lamb to be prominent crypto investor Roger Ver, a claim that Ver denied on social media. In Saturday’s post, CoinFLEX said it holds more than 26 million FLEX tokens – valued at over $7 million at current rates – in its inventory. It added that resuming trades would cause market volatility in FLEX's price, which would inadvertently affect the collateral positions of platform users. The company also said that it is looking to raise a significant amount of funds from investors, including by using customer deposits in exchange for equity. “There are a number of investors in this group of large depositors who have indicated that they may be in a position to help the business move forward if we can all find a workable solution,” the firm said. Recovering the delinquent debt, however, could help buffer FLEX prices and prevent a steep drop, CoinFLEX said. “We believe the recovery of the debt will help build confidence in and will help shore up the trading price of FLEX Coin,” it said. FLEX fell from $4.20 to $1.60 in late June as CoinFLEX went public with its losses, CoinGecko data shows. The lack of a swift recovery plan has added to the losses, with the tokens now down 94% in the past 30 days. Meanwhile, CoinFLEX said that it hopes to make 10% of customers’ balances available for withdrawal in the next week, adding that the arbitration process could “take up to 12 months.” Disclosure Please note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.

78::https://ambcrypto.com/ethereum-sets-sights-on-4k-will-this-spark-a-new-rally-for-eth/::AMBCrypto::article::Ethereum sets sights on $4K: Will THIS spark a new rally for ETH?::Ethereum broke above a falling wedge pattern that might result in a 50% price rise in coming days. ::Ethereum broke above a falling wedge pattern that might result in a 50% price rise in coming days.  Ethereum [ETH] caught investors off guard as its price gained bullish momentum on the 17th of May. While the token’s price moved up, it broke above a bullish pattern that could allow the king of altcoins to touch $4k in the coming days or weeks. CoinMarketCap’s data revealed that ETH investors enjoyed profits last week, as the token’s price had surged by more than 6%.  Things heated up in the last few hours as ETH’s value increased by over 2.6% over the last day. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $3,108.31 with a market capitalization of over $373 billion. The bullish price action had a positive impact on the token’s social metrics, as its Social Volume remained high last week. Its Weighted Sentiment also entered the positive zone, meaning the bullish sentiment around ETH became dominant in the market. Source: Santiment Thanks to the price uptick, ETH broke above a bullish pattern that hinted at a price rise towards $4k. World Of Charts, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet highlighting that ETH broke out of a falling wedge pattern. The pattern appeared on ETH’s chart during the beginning of March, and since then, ETH has consolidated inside it. The tweet mentioned that the breakout could result in a 50% price rise, in turn allowing Ethereum to reclaim $4k once again. AMBCrypto then analyzed ETH’s metrics to see whether they support the possibility of it touching $4k anytime soon. Our analysis of CryptoQuant’s data revealed that ETH’s net deposit on exchanges was low compared to the last seven days’ average, signifying less selling pressure. Source: CryptoQuant Another positive metric was the Coinbase premium, as it indicated that buying sentiment was dominant among U.S. investors. However, not everything looked bullish for the king of altcoins. AMBCrypto’s look at Glassnode’s data revealed that ETH’s Network To Value (NVT) ratio registered a sharp uptick. A rise in the metric suggests that an asset is overvalued, hinting at a price decline. Source: Glassnode Ethereum’s Money Flow Index (MFI) also indicated a possible price correction as the indicator registered a decline. Nonetheless, the MACD displayed a bullish crossover. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also supported the bulls as it went northward. Source: TradingView Read Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2024-25 To see what targets it might reach if its bull rally sustains, AMBCrypto analyzed Hyblock Capital’s data. We found that ETH’s liquidation would rise near the $3.2k zone. A successful breakout above that would allow it to reach $3.5k in the coming days before it targets $4k. However, if ETH’s price turns bearish, then its value might plummet to $2.85k.

In response to those issues, many Argentinians have turned to crypto to safeguard their wealth and avoid prohibitive regulations that damage purchasing power. This guide explores the significant growth of cryptocurrency adoption in Argentina. We examine the underlying factors, their impact on various sectors, and the potential role of digital currencies in addressing the nation’s economic concerns. Since 2017, Argentina has experienced a significant upswing in crypto adoption. This was catalyzed initially by the first bullish surge in the crypto market. The momentum was further reinforced by subsequent crises in the country, each marked by high inflation and currency depreciation. Figures from the Crypto Council For Innovation suggest that one-third of Argentinians use crypto for everyday transactions in 2024. This level of adoption can be attributed to heightened awareness among the population regarding the advantages of decentralized financial systems. This is particularly the case in the context of preserving purchasing power during times of economic turmoil. The rise in cryptocurrency adoption has led to a flourishing ecosystem of crypto startups and companies in Argentina. From blockchain development firms to cryptocurrency apps and exchanges, these entities play a pivotal role in providing innovative solutions to the economic challenges faced by the population. As of 2024, a number of crypto startups are operating in Argentina, showcasing the entrepreneurial spirit driving the integration of digital currencies into the mainstream financial landscape. These companies include Ripio, SatoshiTango, Decrypto, Lemon, and Koibanx. Argentina’s strict currency controls since 2020 have led to a surge in the use of stablecoins. The asset class is a practical solution for individuals seeking to bypass traditional financial constraints. A 2023 report by Bitso, a Mexican crypto exchange, indicated that 60% of the crypto trading volume in Argentina comes from stablecoins, such as USDT or USDC. This underscores an increasing reliance on stable digital assets, pegged to less volatile currencies like the U.S. dollar, to navigate the challenges of accessing hard currency in a regulated environment. Cryptocurrency adoption in Argentina prompts a critical examination of whether digital assets could solve the nation’s persistent currency challenges. While challenges such as regulatory uncertainties and price volatility persist, the potential transformative impact of crypto on the economic landscape is undeniable. A wide sector of the population increasingly views crypto as a viable alternative to traditional banking systems. Recently elected president Milei supports this perspective. The Argentinian president, Javier Milie, also supports the use of crypto. This indicates a shift in government positions regarding the role of digital currencies in securing financial stability. The surge in cryptocurrency adoption in Argentina is backed by compelling statistics. These highlight the tangible impact of economic instability on choices made by individuals and businesses. The growth of crypto startups, the prominence of stablecoins, and the evolving public perception of digital assets all contribute to a dynamic landscape. As Argentina grapples with persistent currency challenges, the role of crypto is increasingly relevant, prompting a crucial discussion about their potential to reshape the nation’s economic future. Cryptocurrencies are gaining popularity in Argentina primarily due to the country’s high inflation and currency depreciation. Many Argentinians view digital currencies as a more stable store of value compared to the Argentine peso. Additionally, cryptocurrencies offer an alternative to traditional financial systems, which are often restricted by stringent government regulations. Stablecoins, which are digital currencies pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar, have become particularly popular in Argentina as a means to circumvent strict currency controls. They provide a more reliable way to preserve wealth and make international transactions without the volatility typically associated with unpegged cryptocurrencies. Approximately 60% of Argentina’s crypto trading volume comes from stablecoins. The rise in cryptocurrency adoption has led to the emergence of numerous crypto startups in Argentina, fostering innovation and entrepreneurship within the country’s tech sector. These startups not only provide solutions to economic issues through blockchain technology but also contribute to job creation and attract international investment. Companies such as Ripio, SatoshiTango, and Lemon are examples of how the crypto industry is influencing the broader financial landscape in Argentina.

80::https://blockworks.co/news/ai-monopoly-privacy-blockchain::Blockworks::article::AI has a monopoly on power and privacy. Blockchain fixes this.::Opinion: Crypto and blockchain can provide a safer, fairer, more human-centric collaboration between AI and the rest of us.::Crypto and blockchain can provide a safer, fairer, more human-centric collaboration between AI and the rest of us Artwork by Crystal Le Many Americans got their first glimpse behind the machine learning curtain when details of Amazon’s “Just Walk Out” technology went public. Instead of pure technology tallying up customers’ purchases and charging them when they left the store, the sales were manually checked by about 1,000 real people working in India. But these workers were the human-half of what most AI really is — a collaboration between reinforcement learning and human intelligence. The human element tends to be ignored in discussions of AI safety, which is a little disturbing given how much of an impact AI will likely have on our job markets and ultimately our individual lives. This is where decentralization, the inherent trustlessness and security of blockchain technology can play a major role. The Center for Safe AI identifies four broad categories of AI risk. As a start, there’s malicious use, in which users might “intentionally harness powerful AIs to cause widespread harm” by engineering “new pandemics or [using them] for propaganda, censorship and surveillance, or [releasing AIs] to autonomously pursue harmful goals.” A more subtle concern is the risk of an AI race, where corporations or nation states compete to quickly build more powerful systems and take unacceptable risks in the process. Unchecked cyberwarfare is a potential outcome, another is allowing systems to evolve on their own, potentially slipping out of human control; or a more prosaic, but no less disruptive outcome, could be mass unemployment from unchecked competition. Organizational risks with AI are similar to any other industry. AI could cause serious industrial accidents, or powerful programs could be stolen or copied by malicious actors. Finally, there’s the risk that the AIs themselves could go rogue, “optimizing flawed objectives, drifting from their original goals, becoming power-seeking, resisting shutdown or engaging in deception.” Regulation and good governance can contain many of these risks. Malicious use is addressed by restricting queries and access to various features, and the court system could be used to hold developers accountable. Risks of rogue AI or and organizational issues can be mitigated by common sense and fostering a safety-conscious approach to using AI. But these approaches don’t address some of the second-order effects of AI. Namely, centralization and the perverse incentives remaining from legacy Web2 companies. For too long, we’ve traded our private information for access to tools. You can opt out, but it’s a pain for most users. AI is no different than any other algorithm, in that what you get out of it is the direct result of what you put in — and there are already massive amounts of resources devoted to cleaning up and preparing data to be used for AI. A good example is OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which is trained on hundreds of billions of lines of text taken from books, blogs and communities like Reddit and Wikipedia, but also relies on people and smaller, more customized databases to fine-tune the output. Read more from our opinion section: What can blockchain do for AI? Not what you’ve heard. This brings up a number of issues. Mark Cuban has recently pointed out that AI will eventually need to be trained on data that companies and individuals might not want to share, in order to become more commercially useful beyond coding and copywriting. And, as more jobs are impacted by AI — particularly as AI agents make custom AI applications accessible — the labor market as we know it could eventually implode. Creating a blockchain layer in a decentralized AI network could mitigate these problems. We can build AI that can track the provenance of data, maintain privacy and allow individuals and enterprises to charge for access to their specialized data if we use decentralized identities, validation staking, consensus and roll-up technologies like optimistic and zero-knowledge proofs. This could shift the balance away from large, opaque, centralized institutions and provide individuals and enterprises with an entirely new economic system. On the technological front, you need a way to confirm the integrity of data, the ownership of data and its legitimacy (model auditing). Then, you would need a method of provenance, (to borrow a phrase from the art world), which means being able to see any piece of data’s audit trail in order to properly compensate whoever’s data is being used. Privacy is also important — a user must be able to secure their data on their own electronics and be able to control access to their data, including being able to revoke that access. Doing so involves cryptography and a security protection certification system. This is an advancement from the existing system, where valuable information is merely collected and sold to centralized AI companies. Instead, it enables broad participation in AI development. Individuals can engage in various roles, such as creating AI agents, supplying specialized data or offering intermediary services like data labeling.

In conversation with the Wolf of All Streets Podcast, Ardoino shared that despite market instability, Tether’s (USDT) circulation has expanded over the last year. The organization backs its currency with its own assets and capital, stemming from investments in US treasuries and short-term holdings managed with due diligence. He disclosed that Tether retains a considerable sum of $72.6 billion in US treasury bills. Ardoino underlined Tether’s commitment to upholding a stablecoin pegged at parity with the US dollar. In the final quarter of 2022, Tether realized a profit of $700 million. Despite close scrutiny from the public eye, Tether has navigated through various crises and major bankruptcies within the web3 domain, cooperating actively with law enforcement, including the Department of Justice, according to Ardoino. He reaffirmed the company’s dedication to offering a stablecoin that mirrors the US dollar one-to-one, without any current intentions for an initial public offering. Ardoino pointed out that over the preceding year, Tether’s USDT saw a rise in distribution, countering the volatility experienced by other digital currencies and stablecoins. Even in a bearish market, USDT’s market capitalization remains over $85 billion, ranking it the third-largest cryptocurrency globally. The recent financial success has prompted Tether to contemplate diversification strategies. The company is also aspiring to evolve into an all-encompassing tech provider, which requires expertise in key sectors such as energy, communication, and financial infrastructure, as he disclosed. Amid the recent buzz around stablecoins in the crypto sphere, Brian Brooks of Valor Capital Group, formerly Acting Comptroller of the Currency and CEO of Binance U.S., noted that stablecoins could reestablish the significance of the U.S. dollar in emerging markets. On the legislative front, July 27 marked a stride forward as the U.S. House Financial Services Committee progressed a bill to set up a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins, typically pegged to traditional assets like the U.S. dollar. This proposed law delegates to the Federal Reserve the task of stipulating stablecoin issuance conditions, while preserving state regulatory authorities’ powers. The bill underwent revisions earlier to alleviate concerns from some democrats about stablecoin issuers potentially skirting stringent regulations by operating under state jurisdictions. Meanwhile, the conviction of ex-crypto mogul Sam Bankman-Fried, implicated in misappropriating over $10 billion from clients and investors, underscores yet another disturbing episode in the crypto industry. Despite such incidents, there seems to be little momentum towards enacting clear regulatory standards. Last year, amidst significant downturns in cryptocurrencies and a wave of bankruptcies, U.S. Congress looked into regulating the sector. However, these efforts have moved slowly, especially given the current year’s challenges like global tensions, inflation, and the looming 2024 election. President Biden issued an executive order on cryptocurrency oversight, directing the Fed to explore the possibility of establishing a digital currency. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

82::https://cryptobriefing.com/sec-ethereum-etf-decision-loom/::Crypto Briefing::article::Fund managers predict SEC rejection of Ethereum ETFs next week::According to Coinbase's analyst, the SEC might reject spot Ethereum funds that allow staking in the near team. Why might the SEC decide to reject spot Ethereum ETFs? The SEC might not approve all spot Ethereum ETF applications at once: Coinbase::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article In contrast to the enthusiasm that preceded the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, reports over the past few weeks suggest that optimistic expectations for the Ethereum product’s approval have cooled down. Speaking with Bloomberg this week, Katherine Dowling, general counsel for ETF applicant Bitwise, said she anticipates rejection next week due to the lack of public activity typically seen before approval. “Most people are universally expecting a disapproval order,” Dowling noted. “You’re not seeing the types of public activities that you would see if there was going to be an approval.” In a CNBC interview, VanEck CEO Jan van Eck also predicted a likely denial. Next week, the SEC’s decision will confirm the fate of VanEck’s and Ark Invest’s filings. “We were the first to file as well for Ethereum in the US, and we and Cathy Wood, are kind of the first in line for May, I guess, to probably be rejected,” he stated. Unlike the frequent revisions made to spot Bitcoin ETF applications, there has been minimal back-and-forth between fund companies and the SEC regarding Ether ETFs. People involved in the talks with the securities agency reported that they had braced for a negative outcome. In the final month leading up to the spot Bitcoin ETF decision, the market buzzed with activity. Fund managers engaged in fierce fee competition, while industry experts placed bullish bets. Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have pegged the approval chances for spot Ethereum ETFs at a mere 25%. Seyffart recently expressed skepticism about a positive outcome, saying a nod is “not happening.” SEC Chair Gary Gensler has not been vocal about Ethereum ETF filings. However, he has clarified that the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs does not set a precedent for other crypto ETFs. Concerns about the classification of most cryptos as securities remain a major obstacle to compliance. According to Scott Johnsson, Van Buren Capital’s general partner, the SEC must provide a clear and detailed explanation if they reject spot Ethereum ETF filings. One potential reason for rejection could be Ethereum’s classification. The obvious purpose is to potentially deny on the basis that these spot filings are improperly filed as commodity-based trust shares and do not qualify if they are holding a security. — Scott Johnsson (@SGJohnsson) May 14, 2024 The SEC has not definitively classified Ether, and its decision might hinge on whether it considers Ether a security. If the SEC views Ether as a security, then spot ETFs wouldn’t be allowed under current regulations. The SEC’s alleged investigations into the Ethereum Foundation and the implications of Ethereum’s staking feature suggest a possible regulatory direction. Despite the uncertainty, Coinbase’s analyst David Han sees a 30% to 40% chance of approval by month’s end. He believes the correlation between CME futures and spot exchange rates, which was pivotal for Bitcoin ETF approvals, could similarly benefit Ethereum ETFs. However, like Johnsson, Han noted that the SEC might focus on Ethereum’s PoS mechanism as a reason for denial since regulations around staking are unclear. He suggested spot Ethereum ETFs enabling staking are unlikely to be approved. ARK Invest and 21Shares recently amended their S-1 form for the proposed spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) by removing the staking component. The move is considered an effort to align the filing with SEC preferences.

83::https://theconversation.com/sam-bankman-fried-sentenced-to-25-years-how-he-went-from-30b-crypto-ceo-to-prison-inmate-217026::The Conversation::article::Sam Bankman-Fried sentenced to 25 years − how he went from $30B crypto CEO to prison inmate::The downfall of the onetime multibillionaire holds lessons for investors and regulators alike.::The case of Sam Bankman-Fried, who was sentenced on March 28, 2024, to 25 years in prison, is emblematic of the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, in which vast sums of money can be made or lost in the blink of an eye. In early November 2022, the crypto exchange FTX was valued at more than US$30 billion. By the middle of that month, FTX was in bankruptcy proceedings. And less than a year later, on Nov. 3, 2023, its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, was found guilty of seven counts of money laundering and fraud, following a trial that featured less than a month of testimony and only about four hours of jury deliberation. D. Brian Blank and Brandy Hadley are professors who study finance, executives, corporate governance and financial technology. They explain how and why this incredible collapse happened, what effect it might have on the traditional financial sector and whether you should care. A million years ago, back in 2019, Bankman-Fried founded FTX, a company that ran one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges. FTX was where many crypto investors traded and held their cryptocurrency, similar to the New York Stock Exchange for stocks. Bankman-Fried also founded Alameda Research, a hedge fund that invested in cryptocurrencies and crypto companies. In the traditional financial sector, these two companies would be entirely separate firms, or at least have firewalls in place to avoid conflicts of interest. But in early November 2022, news outlets reported that a significant proportion of Alameda’s assets were a type of cryptocurrency released by FTX itself. A few days later, news broke that FTX had allegedly been loaning customer assets to Alameda for risky trades without customers’ consent and also issuing its own FTX cryptocurrency for Alameda to use as collateral. As a result, criminal and regulatory investigators began scrutinizing FTX for potentially violating securities law. These two pieces of news basically led to a bank run on FTX, and soon afterward, FTX, Alameda Research and 130 other affiliated companies founded by Bankman-Fried filed for bankruptcy. This left huge numbers of investors who bought cryptocurrencies through the exchange with no good way to get their money back. Within a month, Bankman-Fried was arrested and charged with wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy and money laundering by the Southern District of New York. In February 2023, additional criminal charges related to political donations were announced, followed by another indictment in March related to bribery. Bankman-Fried’s first trial began on Oct. 3, 2023, and largely focused on the “essentially unlimited” access to capital Alameda had on the exchange through a secret line of credit. In traditional markets, corporations generally limit the risk they expose themselves to by maintaining liquidity and solvency. Liquidity is the ability of a firm to sell assets quickly without those assets losing much value. Solvency is the idea that a company’s assets are worth more than what that company owes to debtors and customers. But the crypto world has generally operated with much less caution than the traditional financial sector, and FTX is no exception. About two-thirds of the money that FTX owed to the people who held cryptocurrency on its exchange – roughly $11.3 billion of $16 billion owed – was backed by illiquid coins created by FTX. FTX was taking its customers’ money, giving it to Alameda to make risky investments and then creating its own currency, known as FTT, as a replacement – cryptocurrency that it was unable to sell at a high enough price when it needed to. In addition, nearly 40% of Alameda’s assets were in FTX’s own cryptocurrency – and remember, both companies were founded by the same person. This all came to a head when investors decided to sell their coins on the exchange. FTX did not have enough liquid assets to meet those demands. This in turn drove the value of FTT from over $26 a coin at the beginning of November 2022 to under $2 by Nov. 13. By this point, FTX owed more money to its customers than it was worth. In regulated exchanges, investing with customer funds is illegal. Additionally, auditors validate financial statements, and firms must publish the amount of money they hold in reserve that is available to fund customer withdrawals. And even if things go wrong, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation – or SIPC – protects depositors against the loss of investments from an exchange failure or financially troubled brokerage firm. The crypto world lacks such guardrails. While the collapse of FTX and Alameda – valued at more than $30 billion and now essentially worth nothing – was dramatic, the bigger implication is simply the potential lost trust in crypto. Bank runs are rare in traditional financial institutions, but they are increasingly common in the crypto space. Given that Bankman-Fried and FTX were seen as some of the biggest, most trusted figures in crypto, these events may lead more investors to think twice about putting money in crypto. Though investment in cryptocurrencies has grown rapidly, the entire crypto market – valued at over $3 trillion at its peak – is much smaller than the $120 trillion traditional stock market. While investors and regulators are still evaluating the consequences of this fall, the impact on any person who doesn’t personally own crypto will be minuscule. It is true that many larger investment funds, such as BlackRock and the Ontario Teachers Pension, held investments in FTX, but the estimated $95 million the Ontario Teachers Pension lost through the collapse of FTX is just 0.05% of the entire fund’s investments. The takeaway for most individuals is not to invest in unregulated markets without understanding the risks. In high-risk environments like crypto, it’s possible to lose everything – a lesson investors in FTX learned the hard way. The trial of Bankman-Fried brought attention to the ever-evolving and complex nature of cryptocurrency regulation and oversight. At the conclusion of the case, Damian Williams, the federal prosecutor for the U.S. Justice Department, underlined the department’s dedication to fighting fraud, even in the relatively new crypto space. This case shows that the U.S. is willing to assert broad jurisdiction over financial crimes targeting its citizens, regardless of where the perpetrating company is based, which in FTX’s case was the Bahamas. Notably, this trial did not fall directly under the supervision of the Securities and Exchange Commission or other regulatory bodies, although pending civil cases from both the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, along with ongoing class-action lawsuits, underscore the complexities in regulating the cryptocurrency sphere. Despite a recent crypto crackdown by the SEC, the U.S. continues to lag behind other nations in establishing comprehensive crypto regulations. This is evident in the formal regulatory frameworks introduced by places such as the U.K. and the European Union. The International Monetary Fund’s call for comprehensive regulations further underscores the necessity for more robust regulatory measures within the crypto industry, hinting at a widening gap between the U.S. and much of the rest of the world.

84::https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/05/did-strong-bitcoin-etf-demand-kill-halvings-potential-bullish-rally/::CoinDesk::article::Did Strong Bitcoin ETF Demand Kill Halving's Potential Bullish Rally?::The much stronger-than-expected inflows into the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have already caused concerns about a supply shock in the bitcoin market, potentially taking away some of the impacts of the halving.::Bitcoin's (BTC) halving - which is often seen as a bullish catalyst for the price - may not be as positive as the market thinks, thanks to the approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETF). Halving, which occurs every four years, cuts bitcoin's supply growth by half, historically causing upward pressure on the price of the largest digital asset. The previous halving cycles pushed bitcoin to new highs, and this time, strong demand from the spot ETF may add even more fuel to the rally. “If we look at demand generally since the ETFs have launched, it has created tremendous supply shock already,” said Brian Dixon, CEO of investment firm Off the Chain Capital. “Once the halving occurs, and that supply is further reduced, it's only logical to think that the price will appreciate.” Read more: Bitcoin Halving, Explained On the surface, that may be the case as the demand from the funds has been significantly more than the 900 new BTC that are mined daily. And when that supply gets cut in half, it might create an even bigger pull on the prices. However, it might not play out the same way this time. The price of bitcoin had rallied 46% since Jan. 11, when the spot ETFs started trading in the U.S. The demand from these funds has been so strong that the price of the digital asset rallied to a new all-time high to keep up with the onslaught of bitcoin purchases. But the market may have gotten a bit ahead of itself in the hype. “This is the first time in which bitcoin broke its all-time highs before the halving, so there is a little bit of a concern that the ETFs have pulled demand forward and that maybe we're going to linger where we are for a little bit," said David Lawant, Head of Research at FalconX. Anthony Anderson, founder and CEO of Param Labs and Kiraverse, echoed this sentiment. "Bitcoin ETFs preempted the impact of halving on supply by massively acquiring BTC since the beginning of the year." Also, halving might not affect the ETF flows either due to the already strong demand from the investors, at least not in the short term, according to Bloomberg Intelligence's ETF analyst James Seyffart. Read More: Bitcoin Could Slump Around Reward Halving Time, Arthur Hayes Says "We know many miners use OTC desks to offload their BTC and the ETF issuers also use OTC desks to obtain their Bitcoin as flows come into the fund. So theoretically the potential halving of miner bitcoin sales could mean that ETF inflows will have a greater impact on the underlying market. But for the last few months the ETF inflows have vastly exceeded anything the miners provided from operations," he said. "So if it does have an impact it’s unlikely to be anything extremely impactful in my view," Seyffart added. This is not to say that halving won't be a significant catalyst for bitcoin and the ETF flows in the long term. After all, the success of the ETFs seems to be closely correlated to the price of BTC and vice versa. The halving may even accentuate the appeal of bitcoin as an asset class to institutional investors. “I think the halving is going to be one of the best things for bitcoin since the ETFs launched,” said Bob Iacchino, co-founder of analytics firm Path Trading Partners. “At its core is an inflation protection mechanism and inflation is ramping back up.” In fact, the hype around halving might help bitcoin bring it in front of many investors looking for alternative assets to hedge against the global macro volatility. "This [Halving] is happening at a time when folks are somewhat queasy about the risk that Bitcoin hedges against," said Lawant, pointing out that many investors are starting to pay more attention to how to protect their portfolio against any significant change in global economy and having spot ETF and an asset class with shrinking supply "would be positive for ETF flows." This supply shortage might also lead to a longer-term impact on the ETF flows as it will impact bitcoin's "marginal supply into perpetuity," said Seyffart. He added that, even though the impact of the marginal supply from ETF inflows in the first three months has been much higher than the halving can have, the slashing of the supply of BTC is "permanent and goes into perpetuity." Whatever the case may be, the market may need to brace for volatile short-term trading for bitcoin and perhaps for the ETF flow after the halving, said Anderson, noting that in the long term, net flows for the funds should come in at a similar pace that is seen currently.

Despite its license, this casino didn’t lose out to other casinos on this list, and it may be even better than some. But that’s up to the players to decide. With this, we’ve come to the end of this list. Now, let’s explore the most popular online casino games in Australia. Just as much as Australia is known for its tropical beaches that are filled with wildlife, its residents are known for their love of gambling, which is spread across casino games and betting on sporting events. This led to the establishment of BetStop Australia, which is a self-exclusion program created to battle the rising gambling addiction in the country. However, this didn’t reduce the people’s love for casino games as there are thousands of them out there on the internet begging for them to be explored by Australians. But what are the most popular casino games in the country? Let’s find out below. Blackjack In the world of high rollers, Australians are sure not to lag. Blackjack is one of the most popular choices for the residents of the country as it usually challenges them to adopt several strategies before they can claim a significant win in this kind of game. Blackjack is a casino game that sees players seek to claim a hand closer to 21 but higher than the dealer’s hand. The number must not be exceeded. While Blackjack is known to be a simple game with fewer rules, it seeks the use of an outstanding strategy to claim winnings against the dealers. Many strategies can employed for this game including card counting to improve their chances of winning. This is a game that is known for its competitive edge which lets players display their decision-making abilities to increase their odds of winning. To Australian players, Blackjack comes in different varieties like the classic Blackjack, Pontoon and European Blackjack. There is also live dealer Blackjack which has been gaining some popularity in the world of online casinos as it offers an immersive casino experience due to the presence of real-time professional dealers and players. This makes the game of Blackjack even more attractive to Australians and spiked it up to one of the most popular casino games in the country. Poker Poker is another widely popular online casino game in Australia. Poker can be regarded as both a card and table game, and it is quite popular both offline and online. It is one of the best casino games you can find on the internet. It is a game that relies on skill, strategy and luck before a player can secure a win, which is usually huge. In land-based casinos, playing poker is seen as a way to enjoy social interactions with intellects. Just like Blackjack, Poker is also available in different variations. The most popular variation of this casino game is the Texas Hold’Em, Omaha, a Seven-Card Stud. In online poker, players are allowed to take part in cash games or tournaments which allows them to win prizes in different sizes. The online poker room in many online casinos gives players the ability to against each other from anywhere across the globe, and this played a role in its popularity not only in Australia but also across the world. There are freeroll tournaments in pokers which lets players partake without staking their cash but gives them a chance to win some real money. Roulette Roulette is one of the most popular online casinos accepted by Australians, and it has been around for a long while. Spin the wheel to get a wheel, that’s what the roulette game is about. It is a game that involves a spinning wheel divided into numbered pockets and a small ball that is the decider of the winning number or colour. The online roulette is available in different versions which includes American, European and French roulette. The European and French version features a single zero pocket with better odds for Australians when compared to the American variation which comes with two zero pockets and lesser odds. Online roulette is quite easy to understand, and there are not many rules you need to be familiar with to be able to claim winnings. But you should know that some strategies can be followed to increase a player’s chances of winning. So, you should always research to ensure you’re not losing out on anything. Online Slots Slots are arguably the most popular online casino games not only in Australia but also across the world, and they are numerous in numbers. They usually take up the majority of space in a casino library than every other casino game. Online slots, also known as slot machines, come in a wide variety of themes, high-quality graphics and immersive gameplay experiences. It is also the simplest casino game ever to exist since it was discovered. Online slots are available in different themes that are tailored to all kinds of players. If you’re a soccer fan, you’ll find football-themed slots, if you’re a lover of tennis, you’ll discover many tennis-themed slots that you’re not even aware of their existence. There is a slot theme for almost everything you can think of from finance to city girls, video games, space, music, sports, food, business and many more. Its simplicity is probably one of the reasons Australians love this casino game, as well as the impressive gameplay experience it offers. Baccarat Baccarat has also been able to move the hearts of Australian players over the years, as it is known to be a simple card game. It is a game that revolves around a target that needs to reach a hand total of nine with just two cards. Drawing its similarity from Blackjack, Baccarat is also a comparing card game but it involves just two hands; the banker and the player. It is one of the oldest casino games to have existed as some believe it dates back to the 19th century, which is even before the first online casino made its appearance. Bingo This classic game has captivated audiences for generations, offering a thrilling combination of luck, strategy, and communal fun. Bingo revolves around matching numbers on your individual Bingo card with those called by a designated caller. The winning formula is simple yet exciting – complete a designated pattern (usually a row, column, or diagonal) on your card first, and shout “Bingo!” Throughout the game, numbers are randomly selected. Traditionally, these numbers were drawn from a bingo cage containing numbered balls. Technology has streamlined this process, with Electronic Random Number Generators (RNGs) now widely used in most bingo halls. While the classic format remains a favourite, Bingo boasts a surprising range of variations. From the fast-paced excitement of Horse Racing Bingo to the social atmosphere of Table Bingo, there’s a version suited to every preference. Electronic Bingo offers a high-tech twist, utilizing electronic devices instead of paper cards. The easy-to-understand rules and the minimal equipment required make it a game for everyone. The communal atmosphere, the anticipation of each number called, and the thrill of a potential win all contribute to Bingo’s enduring popularity. When it comes to picking the best online casinos in Australia for your real money ventures, there are several things you need to look out for including the library of casino games. Below, we will discover everything you need to be on the lookout for when picking the one best suited for you. Licensing & Security Before picking an online casino in Australia, one of the deciding factors people check out for is the licensing of the online platform. The online casino you’re picking must have a gaming license from a reputable gaming authority like the Curacao Gaming Authority, the United Kingdom Gambling Commission, or the Malta Gaming Authority. A gambling license is vital for every online casino as it assures players of its security and the fairness of each platform. A license from a reputable gaming authority means that an online casino is being regulated by them, and they’ll have to follow all rules that ensure players’ protection and several other things. Should a dispute arise between a player and an online casino, the gaming authority can step in for the player to help solve the issue. If an online casino doesn’t have a license, you should stray far away from the platform. Library of Casino Games Another thing Australians look out for is the availability of casino games, most online casinos are known for their extensive library of games. The average online casino with licensing from the Curacao Gaming Authority, in most cases, has thousands of casino games housed in its library. In the aforementioned list of best casinos in Australia, most of them host over 4,000 casino games in their libraries, which includes online slots, blackjack, baccarat, poker, craps, and live dealer games. Some even go as far as offering a sportsbook that allows players to place wagers on their favourite sports, players and teams. If you can find popular titles at an online casino, then you should probably be picking them. Reputable Software Providers What good is an extensive library of casino games if they can’t be played in high definition? While most online casinos are known for having thousands of games in their libraries, it is important to ensure that these games are provided by reputable software providers. Reputable software providers, also called game suppliers, are known to always provide high-quality casino games that come with impressive sound effects. They are also known for their provably fair games, which are games their transparent and fair. These games allow players to see how the outcome of each round of the game came to be. These software providers include Microgaming, Play’n Go, Yggdrasil, Playson, NetEnt, Evolution, Pragmatic Play, Ezugi, Vivo Gaming, Real Dealer, and Playtech. Ensure the online casino Australia you’re picking is partnered with at least three of the mentioned software providers in this paragraph. Bonuses & Promotions In the rise of the online casino industry, bonuses and promotions played a vital role in this sector. It quickly became a marketing strategy for online casinos to draw in players from across the world. Ever since then, bonuses and promotions have become an integral part of all online casinos spread across the internet, and online casinos Australia are no exception to this. However, bonuses and promotions vary depending on the online casino. Some online casinos offer bonuses with less stringent wagering requirements than others, and some don’t employ the use of requirements for their players. Always pick an online casino with less strict rules for its promotions and bonuses, or you can just pick the ones best suited to you. Mobile Friendly Before picking an online casino in Australia, you should always check for its mobile friendliness. It’s even better if it has a mobile app that can be downloaded straight to your phone. Mobile friendliness means you can indulge in your favourite casino game from anywhere without having to bring your computer with you. You’ll be able to play your favourite games directly from your phone without the hassle. Mobile compatibility is another reason Australians love the online casinos listed earlier in this article. Customer Support The availability and the speedy response of the customer support of an online casino should also be considered when you’re picking an online casino. It is important to players in Australia. Should a player have questions that can’t be found in the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), they’ll need to contact customer support to give answers to the questions. Most online casinos usually have different methods for contacting their support center; live chat, email address, and toll-free lines. They should be available 24/7. Ensure this is the case for any online casino you’re picking. Online Casino Reviews The last thing you need to check out before deciding on an online casino is to know what people think about it. There are probably hundreds of reviews on a single online casino. Simple research on Google and Bing will let you understand how people view any online casino. You’ll get to know how a platform treats its players, how fast the withdrawal time is, and the previous disputes that have happened. This will help you decide on the best online casino to pick in Australia. It is a major factor to consider when picking an online casino. Conclusion In this article, you’ve been able to explore the best online casino in Australia, as well as the popular casino games being played in the country. You should have no trouble picking any from the aforementioned ten. However, you must carry out your research to better understand the best one suited for you as every player has a different taste.

Futures contracts are standard agreements to buy and sell a specific cryptocurrency at a predefined price at a set time in the future. While spot trades are executed immediately and are concerned with ownership, futures trading is all about speculating on the future price of a token. With futures came controversies: #BREAKING: Is the US covertly trying to BAN crypto?

Both play significant roles in cryptocurrency trading but serve different strategic purposes for traders on platforms like Binance (where they are listed under the same tab). Futures are a tricky market, especially for beginners. My take is to walk before you run. Cut your teeth on spot markets before introducing leverage to the equation. When or even if you start adding leverage, keep leverage low. Remember high leverage equals high risk, and low leverage equals lower risk. During a sideways market, the temptation will be to leverage up and go hard, but perhaps more patience is needed. Wait for the market to come to you. Sometimes, less is more, and you don’t need to be trading every tiny move in the market. If you are interested in Binance crypto futures, it is important to understand how they work before you begin trading. On Binance, you can trade quarterly futures (delivery) or perpetual futures. Trading on the world’s largest crypto exchange has its own set of benefits, especially when it comes to choices. Here is how each futures trading type works fundamentally: Binance offers futures contracts that expire quarterly — in March, June, September, and December. These are fixed-expiration contracts and do not come with the baggage of funding fees. The contracts settle on the expiration date and are ideal for traders who prefer hedging and speculating with a clearer timeline. Binance still doing between $15b to $45b in trading volume PER DAY from their futures trading ONLY👀 Roughly 20x the daily volume of ALL of decentralized perps combined (dYdX, GMX, Synthetix etc.)📊 Protocols building a CEX-like trading experience therefore have massive upside.… pic.twitter.com/EI75l961em Perpetual futures contracts have no expiration date. This way, traders can hold onto positions indefinitely on the condition that the margin is managed correctly. Plus, perpetual futures traders must also keep track of the periodic funding rates. These contracts are flexible and help navigate the market changes better. Quarterly and perpetual futures settled in stablecoins like Tether are termed USD-margined futures. The stability quotient is pegged to the USD. In 2024, Binance offers USDT and even USDC-settled futures contracts. These futures contracts are settled in the crypto that the contracts actually represent. For instance, a Bitcoin-specific futures contract is settled in Bitcoin. Now that we’ve covered some of the key information, let’s dive into the practical steps. Here’s how to trade crypto on the Binance Futures platform. Before you can start trading crypto futures on Binance, you must take the following steps. Keep track of orders where you can get better deals by utilizing the exchange’s native BNB crypto. Here’s what the entire Binance Futures crypto trading process looks like: Once all the order elements are handled, you must review them and confirm the trade to place an order. Did you know? Open interest plays a crucial role in futures trading. Open interest refers to the outstanding futures contracts that have not been settled. For traders, tracking open interest is important because it indicates the liquidity and depth of a particular market. High open interest suggests that many players are involved, which generally leads to better price discovery and more stable markets. Note: You can trade Binance Futures for all the top crypto assets, even via the mobile application. You should, however, choose Binance Pro and not Binance Lite for margin trading in the crypto derivatives market. The Binance crypto exchange allows you to play around with order types, especially when implementing adequate risk management tools. Here are the types that can help you stay on the safer side of the trade: This feature adjusts the stop price at a fixed percent below the market price as the market price rises. If the market price dips, the stop loss price doesn’t change. The market order is submitted when the stop price is hit. Futures trading allows you to trade with leverage, meaning you can open positions larger than your existing capital. Binance offers leverage from 1x to 125x. It’s crucial to understand that higher leverage increases both potential returns and potential risks. You can play around with the dashboard settings to choose the perfect risk-reward ratio for your trades. Here is how you can set these on Binance specifically: Besides the mentioned advanced risk management strategies, you can also set futures-specific trading preferences. These include selecting and customizing the following elements: Trading crypto futures on Binance needn’t be hard. You can even use trading bots specific to platforms like CryptoHopper, 3Commas, and Coinrule. And while each one is good enough, Coinrule and 3Commas are the easiest ones to use and test, courtesy of the following features: Even experts believe in the potential of AI bots: However, there are many interesting ways that AI and crypto could intersect in the future. • Crypto-powered reputation systems for GPU renting • AI bots for trading & predictions • Blockchain-based incentives to train AI • Digital media authentication https://t.co/7TnkzJXiB8 But wait, why would you want to use bots even? Plus, you can connect Coinrule to Binance and start slow, using the demo account first. Here is a quick guide to help you make sense of using Coinrule for trading Binance Crypto Futures: (The API process is rather uniform for most trading bot ecosystems) Here are some of the examples of how your trades will be executed: This is the level of automation you can achieve using trading bots. “One of the downsides of using bots is that you’ll be paying more trading fees because you’re trading more actively.” So, how do all these elements of the Binance Futures trading platform work? Here is an example: If you have previously traded crypto futures, here are some of the more advanced elements found on Binance to help you take your trading performance to the next level: Here is a quick take on reading funding rates: “Bitcoin funding rate premium has heavily dropped off over the past 24 hours. That’s a good thing, especially if you are a spot buyer. This happening in a consolidation around prior ATH could fuel the next leg.” Automate your trades with #Binance Futures trading bots. Set your price levels, sit back, and let the bot do the rest! Get started ➡️ https://t.co/en7LBGp1oY pic.twitter.com/OCtTeOx14v These strategies and sections work regardless of the USD-M and Coin-M futures trading form you choose. Note that to get the most out of BBO and queue orders, you need to understand how an order book works with crypto futures trading platforms. As mentioned earlier, the crypto derivatives market on Binance extends beyond Bitcoin. You can trade all the top coins, with varying leverage, choice of settlement — delivery or perpetual, and the choice of an asset to settle in — USDT, USDC, or the contract-specific coin. Binance offers one of the best trading experiences for crypto futures. Yet, if you are concerned about trading regulations, geographical restrictions, and other elements, here are a few Binance alternatives to consider: Futures trading for beginners can be tricky. However, if you’re still keen to get started, trading crypto using Binance Futures is an excellent option, as the dashboard itself is self-explanatory and beginner-friendly. Regardless of your expertise and skill level, it is important to stay aware of the regulations and risk management techniques in order to keep your account and funds safe. However, if you are risk averse and just starting your crypto journey, it is advisable to focus on more traditional investment vehicles, such as crypto ETFs, rather than diving straight into the riskier world of futures. Yes, Binance Futures is a reliable trading option for beginners. Futures trading for beginners can be tricky if the platform is too complex or lacks the right educational tools. Binance solves this by offering a minimal approach towards the crypto derivatives market and leverage trading — the fundamental elements of futures contracts. Note that regardless of the platform you choose, futures are relatively complex financial intruments. Do not trade futures without a solid understanding and plan. To make $100 a day trading Bitcoin futures on Binance with BTC priced at $60,000, employ a strategy with careful risk management. Begin by setting a daily goal of $100 with a $10,000 account, using 10x leverage. Risk 2% per trade ($200), buying BTC at the supposed price of $60,000, setting a stop-loss at $59,500 to limit losses to $200, and aiming for a profit target of $60,300 to gain $150. This approach uses a 1:1.5 risk/reward ratio, requiring precise execution and active monitoring to adjust stop-loss and take-profit levels as needed. Note that this is theoretical. Profits are never guaranteed. To trade in crypto futures, you need to first start by creating an account. Then, you need to fund the futures wallet, learn the basics of futures trading, the concepts of leverage and margin, and start analyzing elements like the funding rate, open interest, and more to kickstart the proceedings. You can set a take-profit order at a specific price. This way, you can lock your profits. This aspect is necessary in the world of cryptocurrency derivatives trading as you can quickly book profits by closing the contracts before the market turns against you.

This solution will utilize technology to ensure the security and authenticity of the stored data. The plan is to send a payload containing “data cubes” to the Moon in February 2024. Once the data reaches Earth it will be verified and authenticated using blockchain technology. If this project is successful the blockchain technology used will provide proof of human presence on the Moon during NASAs upcoming manned mission called Artemis 3 scheduled for 2025. Before that mission takes place Artemis 2 will be launched in November 2024. This mission will involve orbiting the Moon with four astronauts on board before returning to Earth. It serves as a rehearsal for the anticipated lunar landing that will happen during Artemis 3. Lonestar and the Isle of Man are working together on this groundbreaking initiative to establish long lasting lunar storage systems during NASAs Artemis missions. These systems will be powered by energy and won’t require any additional infrastructure. According to a report from BBCs Science Focus this experiment involves creating ” franking” or digital stamps that are stored within these lunar data cubes. Once these stamps are placed on the Moons surface their integrity and completeness will be confirmed through verification here on Earth. Thanks to blockchains nature future astronauts who land on the Moon can use these data cubes for various purposes such, as lunar check ins. Interactions like these can be verified using technology, which could potentially address any future conspiracy theories surrounding Moon landings. Although NASA has faced difficulties in countering conspiracy theories related to lunar missions between 1969 and 1972 it is anticipated that blockchain will provide indisputable proof, for upcoming human lunar landings. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

89::https://cryptobriefing.com/evm-move-growth-surge/::Crypto Briefing::article::Move-based blockchains growth relies on EVM compatibility: Movement Labs co-founder::Movement Labs' M2 bridges Move and Ethereum ecosystems, set for testnet launch.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Move-based blockchains are surging in total value locked (TVL) this year, with Sui leaping 233% and Aptos also showing significant growth of 210%, according to data aggregator DefiLlama. Rushi Manche, co-founder of Movement Labs, believes that compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) could bolster this growth even more. “I think the biggest issue for new systems is how do you onboard developers and new users and a lot of these next-gen and new VM languages realize that if you don’t have compatibility for EVM, you really limit the amount of growth that you have the first two or three years,” said Manche to Crypto Briefing. Ethereum’s mainnet alone dominates over 67% of all decentralized finance TVL, and that’s the reason why new blockchains based on new virtual machines have to create compatibility. Movement’s M2 is the first layer-2 blockchain based on Move that has compatibility with EVM applications and can help bridge the gap between these two ecosystems. They are still in devnet phase, with testnet and mainnet phases set to launch later this year. Move is the language created by Meta to deploy their crypto project called Diem. However, due to regulatory pressure, Diem was shelved and two different groups consisting of former Meta employees created Aptos and Sui. “Broader than that, Movement itself has a network of blockchains where anyone who’s looking to launch their own customized high throughput rollup on Ethereum can leverage the Move Virtual Machine to launch their own framework with OP stack, Polygon CDK or Arbitrum Orbit.” To explain how Movement is combining EVM and Move, Manche uses the traditional technology sector, where new tech has backward compatibility with what has been used so far. As an example, he compared the Sony PlayStation consoles, as new models have compatibility with games launched for older generation versions. “So the way we approach it is: EVM compatibility is a way for us to onboard legacy software. If you want to write Uniswap, write Aave, or bring code from Arbitrum, the best way to do that is using the EVM interpreter.” Nevertheless, Manche still believes that long-term usage and long-term performance for smart contracts rely on Move and Rust programming languages.

90::https://theconversation.com/facebooks-libra-cryptocurrency-can-still-take-off-and-revolutionise-money-125504::The Conversation::article::Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency can still take off and revolutionise money::Libra has lost seven of its 28 founding members – but don’t expect that to hold it back.::Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency has suffered a few setbacks recently. As well as facing pressure from global regulators, seven of its 28 founding members have left the project – including high profile firms PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, eBay and Stripe. It leaves 21 companies in the Libra Association, the organisation overseeing the cryptocurrency. But Facebook is big enough to launch Libra on its own, so why are these members even needed? After all, it is Facebook’s network of 1.59 billion daily active users that form the foundation of its business case to issue a non-sovereign currency. Why share the spoils? The answer may be twofold. First, by having a council of members this enables Facebook to claim decentralisation status – a key tenet of any cryptocurrency. It’s a far cry from the fully decentralised alternatives of bitcoin et al., but certainly not centralised, so a valid claim. Second, and perhaps primarily, by having a group of high-profile businesses as Libra members it goes some way towards sugarcoating this disruption in the eyes of the world’s regulators, in readiness for the inevitable pushback. Many of the departing members – most being payments firms – stood to lose much of their core business if Libra becomes successful. So, in the face of the project facing additional scrutiny, Libra quickly became a net negative prospect for them and a respectful early withdrawal is entirely rational. But their places are likely to soon be taken up by other prospective members waiting in the wings. There are many companies that will want to capitalise on what could be a revolutionary global money system. Total membership is likely to be expanded as a show of strength. Ben Maurer, Facebook’s blockchain technology lead, explained in June that, “over time, [Libra] is designed to transition the node membership from these founding members, who have a stake in the creation of the ecosystem, to people who hold Libra and have a stake in the ecosystem as a whole”. Read more: Facebook’s Libra: it’s not the ‘crypto’ that’s the issue, it's the organisation behind it Facebook has already announced that some 1,500 entities have expressed interest. So turning up the dial of decentralisation is the intended objective – publicly, at least. This will help assuage the concerns of regulators that Facebook holds too much power over the new cryptocurrency. The fight for the future of money is on. What is at stake is the ability to extract value from the minting of new currency, known as seigniorage. The stakes couldn’t be higher. The Bank of International Settlements (the bank for central banks) estimates that total global money is approximately US$5 trillion, while the CIA put that figure closer to US$80 trillion in 2017, if “broad money” (which includes the figures in everyone’s bank accounts) is included. In comparison, the market capitalisation of all cryptocurrencies at the time of writing is US$215 billion, some 372 times smaller than this latter estimate of total money. Facebook has the reach and the technology to make its cryptocurrency mainstream, but nation states have the regulatory power of veto to retain their monopolistic hold over monetary policy. Presently, their strategy is to spook any potential Libra partners to abandon the project. For example, US senators Sherrod Brown and Brian Schatz sent a letter earlier this month to the CEOs of Visa, Mastercard and Stripe saying any Libra members should expect a higher level of scrutiny not just of this project but also of their core business, too. Read more: Facebook's libra has staggering potential – state control of money could end But this pressure will only work with some companies – particularly more traditional financial firms that will ultimately lose out to Libra. The goals of the Libra project are big. If Facebook wanted to simply make some extra profits, it could have issued a voucher system, akin to a supermarket reward scheme. See Facebook’s previous attempt at issuing Facebook Credits that were terminated in 2012. This would probably have avoided the regulatory scrutiny it has received with the Libra project and would be well-placed to take off. If Facebook simply charged users for tokens used to play games or purchase content within its applications, then regulators may have been less interested. After all, what is the real difference between purchasing Facebook credit with domestic currency to, say, purchasing credit from Vodafone to top up a prepay phone? But the Libra project is more than this. Its aim is not to create a voucher system for internal use – it is not even to create a rival to a national currency – it is to create a global currency more similar to the euro than the US dollar, to service the under-banked and unbanked as well as threaten the dominance of existing fiat currencies in established markets. The Libra Association provides this possibility because it gives the project clout and legitimacy in front of regulators. It may even be that the financial regulators will in time feel a missed opportunity in not supporting the Libra project further. Cryptocurrencies, and corporate cryptocurrencies especially, continue to evolve and innovate. A challenger currency like Libra, with a transparent operating structure, the involvement of traditional financial firms and a recognisable, if currently bespoke monetary mechanism, could soon be seen as the lesser of forthcoming monetary evils in the form of truly decentralised globally relevant cryptocurrencies. If that is the case, expect a renewed clamour for a seat at the Libra Association table.::2019-10-18T12:12:15Z::Bitcoin, Blockchain, Central banks, Cryptocurrency, Facebook, Finance, Financial regulations, Libra, Mark Zuckerberg, Money::Gavin Brown::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/297641/original/file-20191018-56228-848dsw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C142%2C5611%2C2805&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

Trading volume in futures and options tied to cryptocurrencies on centralized exchanges rose 86.5% to a record high of $6.18 trillion, translating to three times of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. Still, the market dominance of derivatives slipped to 67.8%, the lowest since December 2022 as traders flocked to the spot market, where cryptocurrencies are exchanged for immediate delivery. Spot trading volume jumped 108% to $2.94 trillion, the highest monthly volume since May 2021. The combined spot and derivatives trading volume increased 92.9% to a record $9.12 trillion. "The spike in spot trading activity on centralized exchanges coincides with the growing excitement around Bitcoin reaching new all-time highs and the initial signs of returning retail participants in the market," CCData's monthly report said. Derivatives are often criticized for creating artifical demand and supply via leverage, injecting volatility into the market and are considered a proxy for speculative activity often observed at major market tops. As such, the decline in derivatives' share of the total market activity might be a good news for crypto bulls anticipating a continued price rally. Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market value, rose 16.6% in March, setting new record highs above $73,000, CoinDesk data show. Prices rose over 68% in the first quarter. The CoinDesk 20 Index, a broader market gauge, jumped over 50% in the first three months. Edited by Parikshit Mishra.

Non-custodial wallet for Solana staking – Image via Atomic Wallet Atomic Wallet provides extensive support to SOL staking, ensuring users have 100% control over their funds. Trusted by over five million users worldwide, it’s accessible on various operating systems, including Windows, MacOS, Ubuntu, Debian, and Fedora. With Atomic Wallet, users can earn up to 7% APY on staking SOL, with a maximum stake of 100,000 coins for periods ranging from 24 hours to 12 months. The interface makes it easy to track and manage the staked funds and start earning rewards promptly. The wallet further streamlines the staking process by automating all background operations, including the creation of the stake account. However, each time a user initiates a staking or unstaking transaction for SOL, a network fee is required. Additionally, to ensure future transactional activities are seamless, Atomic Wallet reserves 0.000038 SOL from the user address. The SOL deposits remain locked during the staking period. They are not counted towards the total balance and can’t be transferred or swapped. Staking and unstaking take about three days each per epoch, and users start earning rewards approximately two epochs after the deposit is fully staked. Lastly, each additional SOL staking creates a new stake account on the blockchain, not combining with existing ones. Liquid staking with Jito – Image via Jito Jito is a liquid staking solution for Solana, offering users the ability to earn rewards through Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) powered staking. It enables users to unlock liquidity on their staked SOL and support network decentralization by spreading stakes across the network. The process involves depositing SOL into the Jito pool to receive JitoSOL, which then gets delegated to MEV-enabled validators. These validators earn MEV rewards by auctioning off block space, and the rewards are redistributed to the stake pool as extra APY in addition to the regular staking rewards The platform leverages state-of-the-art encryption techniques and multi-layered security protocols to safeguard users’ assets, ensuring peace of mind throughout the staking journey.

Here are some common ones: Each method has its own risk, reward, and commitment level, so it’s crucial to do your research and consider what fits best with your investment strategy, technical ability, and risk tolerance. Choose a wallet that supports Solana and staking, like Phantom, Solflare, or Ledger. Download the wallet application and securely set it up. Remember to store your seed phrase safely. If you don’t already own SOL, you can purchase it from a cryptocurrency exchange such as Binance, Coinbase, or Kraken. After purchasing, transfer the SOL to your chosen wallet. Start by accessing the staking section within your chosen wallet. Then, create a new staking account, following the wallet’s prompts. Finally, transfer the desired amount of SOL from your wallet to the newly created staking account Validators are nodes that process transactions and run the blockchain. Look for a validator with a good track record, reasonable fees, and is geographically distributed to ensure network resilience. To delegate your SOL: Your stake will need to go through an activation period. Once it is active, you’ll start earning rewards. These rewards are typically distributed every epoch and can be auto-staked or transferred to your wallet, depending on your settings. Regularly check your staking status and the performance of your validator. You can unstake, restake, or add more SOL to your staking to adjust your investments. If you decide to unstake your SOL: Gain perspective on cryptocurrency investments by reading about the outcomes of investing $1000 in the top 5 cryptocurrencies at the start of 2023.

This method lets traders speculate on price movements, bet on prices going up or down, and potentially profit from these predictions. These contracts are typically leveraged, meaning traders can control large amounts of cryptocurrency with a relatively small amount of capital, which can increase both potential gains and risks. In contract trading, “long” and “short” are terms used to describe the types of bets traders make on the future price movements of cryptocurrencies. Both types of trading often use leverage, which means using borrowed money to increase potential returns. This can make both potential profits and losses significantly larger than in traditional trading. Choosing the right crypto contract trading platform involves considering various factors to ensure that the platform meets your trading needs and provides a secure, reliable environment. Here’s how to evaluate different platforms: Contract trading in cryptocurrency offers several benefits that make it an attractive option for many traders: Overall, the main benefit of contract trading in cryptocurrency is that it can provide sophisticated mechanisms for traders looking to exploit market inefficiencies, hedge, or increase exposure to markets with a relatively small capital outlay. Contract trading in cryptocurrency, while offering potential benefits, also carries several risks: Crypto contract trading and traditional options trading share some fundamental similarities. However, they also have distinct differences catering to different traders and investment strategies. Crypto contract trading platforms offer several advantages that can be appealing to both novice and experienced traders: While these advantages make crypto contract trading attractive, traders need to consider the associated risks and ensure they understand the market before participating. An anecdote of crypto contract trading going wrong: This is where the risks of contract trading and leveraged trading come in, and when you can't afford your risk, you shouldn't be doing it Investing in crypto contracts involves several straightforward steps. Here’s a simple guide to get you started: Before investing, learn about different types of crypto contracts, such as futures, options, and perpetual swaps. Understand the terms, mechanics, and risks associated with each. Selecting the right crypto futures trading platforms is essential for accessing various instruments and leverage options. Consider security features, regulatory compliance, trading fees, and customer support. Register for an account on your chosen platform. You will likely need to verify your identity with documents such as a passport or driver’s license, depending on the platform’s requirements and your region’s regulations. Once your account is set up, deposit funds. Most platforms accept cryptocurrency deposits, and some also support fiat currencies like USD or EUR. Choose your preferred method and follow the instructions to make a deposit. Develop a trading plan. Decide how much you want to invest, set your profit targets and loss limits, and how you will manage risks, especially since crypto contracts can involve leverage. Select the type of contracts you want to trade. Each contract has specific characteristics and terms, such as expiration dates for futures and strike prices for options. Learning how to trade Bitcoin options can significantly enhance your ability to manage risk and capitalize on market volatility. Use a trading interface to place your trades. You can choose from various order types, such as market orders (buy/sell immediately at current prices) or limit orders (set a specific price at which you want to buy or sell). Once you have opened positions, monitor the market closely. Use tools like stop-loss orders to manage risk. Moreover, be prepared to adjust your positions based on market movements and news. Decide when to exit your trades. Depending on the contract type, you can close your positions by executing a trade in the opposite direction or letting your options or futures expire. After closing your positions, you can choose to withdraw your profits or reinvest them into new contracts. Check the withdrawal procedures and limits on your platform. Following these steps will help you start investing in crypto contracts. Remember, it’s important to continually educate yourself and stay updated with market trends and news to make informed decisions. Looking to expand beyond the spot markets but not sure where to start? Here’s how to trade Bitcoin futures and options like a pro. Choosing the right crypto contract trading platform is essential. Whether your focus is on derivatives or leverage trading, the ideal platform should offer competitive trading fees, a user-friendly interface, and robust features. Remember that contract trading is high-risk, and you should never invest more than you can afford to lose. OKX, BingX, and Binance are considered some of the best platforms for options trading in cryptocurrency, offering extensive tools and a wide range of options. They provide deep liquidity, robust trading interfaces, and comprehensive security measures. Each platform caters to different levels of trader expertise and geographical availability. To evaluate the liquidity of a trading platform, check the trading volume of your desired assets, observe the tightness of the bid-ask spread, and note the speed at which trades are executed. High trading volumes and narrow spreads typically indicate good liquidity. Platforms often publish their liquidity metrics, which can provide further insights. Common fees in crypto contract trading include trading fees (maker and taker fees), withdrawal fees, and, in some cases, overnight financing fees (or funding rates) for holding positions open over a period. Trading fees vary by platform and can be reduced based on trading volume or platform-specific tokens. Some platforms may also charge deposit fees or fees for special order types. Yes, you can trade cryptocurrency contracts through various derivatives like futures, options, and perpetual swaps. These contracts allow traders to speculate on the future prices of cryptocurrencies without directly holding the asset. Most major crypto exchanges offer some form of contract trading. The best platform for crypto trading depends on the trader’s needs, but Binance and Kraken are widely regarded as leading choices. They offer many cryptocurrencies, advanced trading features, and robust security measures. Considerations for choosing a platform should include fees, available cryptocurrencies, and user interface. Yes, Binance is a contract trading platform that offers a variety of derivative products, including futures and options. It provides high liquidity, extensive leverage options, and a wide range of crypto pairs. Binance is known for its low fees and comprehensive platform features. The compatibility of contract trading with Islamic finance principles depends on the specific contract and trading method. Generally, conventional leveraged contract trading might not be considered halal due to the involvement of interest, excessive uncertainty, and speculation. However, Islamic finance products that comply with Shariah law are available on some platforms.

The study, published in a subsidiary of Nature, reported mixed results: The artists thought of blockchain as a possible new route for revenue generation but doubted blockchain-enabled applications would become reality. Interviewees believed that blockchain applications for the music industry could better their financial prospects and help protect copyright. Skepticism stemmed from a general belief that blockchain music startups would lack the heft to unseat the current behemoths in the music industry.

95::https://coinatory.com/cryptocurrency-news/bhutan-bitcoin-mining-18198/::Coinatory::article::Bhutan Embarks on Monumental Bitcoin Mining Expansion Before Next Halving::Discover Bhutan's ambitious plan to sextuple its Bitcoin mining operations by 2025, leveraging state-of-the-art technology and sustainable hydroelectric power, in a strategic move ahead of the Bitcoin halving.::In a strategic maneuver poised to redefine the cryptocurrency mining landscape, the Kingdom of Bhutan, in collaboration with the Nasdaq-listed mining titan Bitdeer, has announced plans to significantly bolster its Bitcoin mining operations. Amidst the looming anticipation of Bitcoin’s fourth halving event, this partnership aims to amplify Bhutan’s mining capacity to an astonishing 500 megawatts by 2025, marking a 600% increase. Druk Holding & Investments (DHI), Bhutan’s sovereign investment arm, is at the forefront of this ambitious initiative. By harnessing Bitdeer’s cutting-edge mining technology and Bhutan’s vast hydroelectric power resources, DHI is set to navigate the potential revenue fluctuations anticipated from the halving event. This expansion is not just a venture into enhancing computational power but a step towards solidifying Bhutan’s position as a frontrunner in the innovative ecosystem of cryptocurrency mining. Matt Linghui Kong, Bitdeer’s Chief Business Officer, revealed in a Bloomberg interview the project’s goal to elevate Bhutan’s mining capabilities to a total of 600 megawatts by the first half of 2025. This leap forward is underpinned by the deployment of the latest mining hardware, optimizing both cost efficiency and computing power. The financing of this substantial upgrade, though not publicly disclosed in its entirety, is understood to be supported by a $500 million fund jointly established by DHI and Bitdeer in May 2023. This financial infusion underscores the collaborative commitment to advancing Bhutan’s mining infrastructure, leveraging the country’s renewable energy assets. Situated between the economic powerhouses of China and India, Bhutan has long pursued economic diversification, with a particular emphasis on hydropower. The venture into cryptocurrency mining, spearheaded by Druk Holding & Investments, is viewed as a cornerstone for cultivating an innovation-driven economy. This includes ventures in asset tokenization and the creation of “Bhutanverse,” a pioneering metaverse project in partnership with Smobler Studios and The Sandbox, aimed at fostering a dynamic startup ecosystem. As the Bitcoin community anticipates the halving event slated for April, which will see mining rewards halve from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC per block, Bhutan and Bitdeer stand resilient. Their strategy is underpinned by Bitdeer’s competitive advantage of a low mining cost per Bitcoin, currently estimated at $20,000 per BTC, positioning them to navigate the challenges of reduced mining rewards with operational efficiency. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

96::https://cryptobriefing.com/solana-fastest-blockchain-coingecko/::Crypto Briefing::article::Solana leads as the fastest among large-scale blockchains — CoinGecko::Solana's TPS is 46 times faster than Ethereum and 5 times faster than Polygon.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Research from CoinGecko says that Solana is the fastest among large-scale blockchains, with its actual daily average transactions per second (TPS) reaching a record high of 1,504 on April 6, 2023 as the meme coin mania took off. Such a statistic makes Solana roughly 46 times faster than Ethereum, and 5 times faster than Polygon. To determine the fastest blockchains, CoinGecko’s study analyzed the processing speed of the top 30 blockchains based on their total value locked (TVL) ranking on DefiLlama as of May 15, 2024. Processing speed was measured using the actual or realized transactions per second (TPS) metric, calculated as a daily average to ensure a standardized comparison across as many blockchains as possible. CoinGecko claims the highest real TPS values reported in the study may differ from other calculations because these use daily averages. The TPS data was sourced from publicly available information provided by the respective blockchain explorers and Dune Analytics. However, some blockchains, including Hyperliquid, PulseChain, Kava, Cardano, and Rootstock, were excluded from the study due to a lack of sufficient data. Despite ranking as the fastest blockchain, Solana has still only achieved 1.6% of its theoretical maximum speed of 65,000 TPS, CoinGecko claims. The surging number of transactions resulted in network congestion, and it remains to be seen how quickly Solana can record higher real TPS after its upcoming upgrades. The second-fastest blockchain is another non-EVM, Sui, which recorded its highest real TPS of 854 in July 2023 as onchain game Sui 8192 gained popularity. Other fast blockchains among the non-EVMs include TON at 175 TPS and Near Protocol at 118 TPS. Altogether, the 8 non-EVM large blockchains have an average peak TPS of 284, making them 3.9 times faster than the 17 largest EVM and EVM-compatible blockchains, which realized an average of just 74 TPS. Among the EVM blockchains, BNB Smart Chain (BSC) achieved 378 in real TPS on December 7, 2023, amid the inscriptions-driven surge in onchain activity. This makes BSC the fastest blockchain among EVMs, despite only ranking third overall and reaching less than half of Sui’s realized processing speed. Similarly, the inscriptions craze allowed Polygon to record 190 in real TPS on November 16, 2023, making it the fastest among the largest Ethereum scaling solutions and 8.4 times faster than Ethereum itself. Ethereum and its ten largest scaling solutions registered a total real TPS of 500, placing their combined processing speed ahead of BSC but still slower than Solana and Sui. Almost all of the 25 blockchains experienced their highest real TPS over the last one year, pointing to onchain activity increasing and reaching higher levels in recent months, led by inscriptions and meme coin speculation.

97::https://theconversation.com/more-than-1-000-cryptocurrencies-have-already-failed-heres-what-will-affect-successes-in-future-127463::The Conversation::article::More than 1,000 cryptocurrencies have already failed – here’s what will affect successes in future::With Wall Street slowly taking charge of crypto, the days of radical outsiders launching successful altcoins may be numbered.::Many cryptocurrencies have been launched in the past few years, often to great fanfare and celebration, only to fade and fail as the public and investors shun them. According to Coinopsy, which tracks such failures, there are some 1,085 dead coins at the time of writing. That’s a substantial number, even next to the approximately 3,000 still in existence, and senior industry figures expect many of those to fail, too. Why do so many of these projects unravel? You expect many initiatives to come and go in a fledgling market, of course – the 1990s dotcom bubble is the perfect example. But at the same time, cryptocurrency developers have traditionally spent too little time designing the business-use case for their coins and tokens, then only realising after the launch that their idea is yesterday’s news. Time and again, we see launches that copy a previously successful coin – “coin x is the new Bitcoin”, for example. Yet the market already has Bitcoin, and it continues to be in demand – as evidenced by the 18 millionth Bitcoin being mined only last month. We tend to overlook this problem with developers, even while we rightly criticise regulators for not being able to keep up with the fast evolution of the crypto market – despite efforts such as Howey Coin by US regulator the SEC, which was a fake new coin offering designed to teach investors about the risks of putting money into crypto. No doubt these kinds of developer errors will continue. Here are several other themes that we think will have a bearing on future crypto failures: Eleven years ago, the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto quietly revolutionised money with the release of his or her now famous white paper that outlined Bitcoin. In the early years after this vision took off, many of those who launched altcoins and tokens were small teams of developers and leftfield entrepreneurs. They had a clear mission to bring the world of traditional finance and central banks to its knees with decentralised units of exchange that were beyond anyone’s control. A few years on, these bank killers have largely been assimilated by the big financial institutions they once sought to challenge. Wall Street is steadily taking charge of the crypto action, professionalising trading with the likes of derivatives and futures products. We may now be entering a phase where only large institutions will be able to generate profit from cryptocurrency design. It seems increasingly likely that the next revolutionary white paper will be generated by a global multi-billion-dollar firm – an ironic full turn of events, to say the least. Many other cryptocurrencies from more humble beginnings will fail in future, simply because they don’t have the resources to compete with these huge institutions. They will be driven by sunk costs and the crypto dream to dominate the future of money, but in many cases it won’t be enough. For a cryptocurrency to be successful, two things need to happen: there has to be a reason why people want to use it, and they have to trust it. People will generally trust a coin or token thanks to the underpinning blockchain technology, the decentralised cryptographic ledger systems on which this industry is built. This means that the basis upon which the market judges if a new launch will stand or fall is mainly its use case. There are now altcoins in existence offering everything from new ways to fund web advertising to units of exchange in the gaming world. But more generally, in a world in which it is no longer enough to simply claim to have launched a better Bitcoin, the market’s attention has pivoted towards stablecoins. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are designed to avoid the wild volatility of cousins like Bitcoin by being pegged or backed by assets like traditional currencies or precious metals. They are designed to encourage people to use cryptocurrency for everyday buying and selling, while also offering a stable store of value for traders on the many crypto exchanges that don’t deal in traditional currencies. Examples include USD Coin and Tether, both of which are equivalent to US$1. The fact that it takes considerable financial resources and infrastructure to make such coins operational is again likely to favour large institutions – witness Facebook’s attempt to launch the Libra stablecoin, for instance. Many investors have lost money through scams in the crypto world. One recent notorious example is the alleged OneCoin ponzi scam, in which investors were promised guaranteed 300% returns for investing Bitcoin or US dollars with a Nevada-based outfit. The money was supposed to be ploughed into foreign exchange options and altcoins, but was allegedly instead used to pay off other investors in the scheme. Fortune magazine recently speculated that OneCoin may have generated losses in excess of the US$19.4 billion (£15 billion) racked up by Bernie Maddoff’s ponzi victims in 2008. Somewhat different was Bitconnect, an exchange in which investors could swap Bitcoin for Bitconnect coins, which would be lent out with claimed returns of up to 120% per year. After longstanding ponzi accusations, the US authorities stepped in last year and the exchange abruptly closed. Bitconnect coins plunged 96% in value, creating huge losses, though they still exist and trade today. An alternative problem is hackers raiding exchanges. The most infamous example is the Mt Gox attack of 2014, in which over 850,000 bitcoins were stolen and never recovered. More recently the Binance exchange, one of the world’s largest, has been hacked several times, costing investors tens of millions of dollars. One other alarming case was that of Gerald Cotten, the 30-year-old founder of Canadian cryptocurrency exchange Quadriga, who died a year ago. Because nobody had access to his passwords, the investments of 115,000 customers worth US$137m were unrecoverable. When a court-appointed auditor was eventually able to access his account, it turned out the assets had all been sold months before Cotten died. We fully expect these sorts of problems to continue – and this shouldn’t be surprising. We are talking about a toxic combination of anonymous technology that is largely unregulated, poorly understood, and cheap and easy to move around the world – and many people willing to kiss frogs in their search for a lucrative prince.::2019-11-21T13:47:23Z::Bitcoin, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, Facebook, Libra, Satoshi Nakamoto, Tether, stablecoin::Gavin Brown::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/302732/original/file-20191120-524-1njq9ry.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=115%2C469%2C5139%2C2569&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
98::https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/04/hedge-funds-hold-record-bearish-bitcoin-bets-data-show/::CoinDesk::article::Hedge Funds Hold Record Bearish Bitcoin Bets, Data Show::Most funds may have taken short positions as a part of a "carry trade," one observer said.::Leveraged funds, which the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) describes as hedge funds and commodity trading advisers, held record bearish wagers on the bitcoin (BTC) price at the end of the first quarter as the cryptocurrency's rally stalled near record highs. Hedge funds boosted their net short positions in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's (CME) standard bitcoin futures contracts to 16,102. That's the most since the futures began trading in late 2017, according to CFTC figures published last week. CME's standard bitcoin futures contracts are sized at 5 BTC. A short futures position is a trading strategy in which a trader sells a futures contract to profit from or hedge against an expected drop in the underlying asset's price. Carry traders or arbitrageurs short futures while simultaneously buying the asset to safely pocket the price differential between the spot and futures market. The record buildup in short positions likely reflects hedge funds' renewed interest in the carry trade, according to Markus Thielen, CEO of 10x Research. "There is a massive demand from hedge funds to put on carry trades. Despite bitcoin’s -10% decline from the all-time high, the futures premium has remained in double digits, and hedge funds are taking advantage of these high rates," Thielen told CoinDesk in an interview. While bitcoin's bullish momentum stalled after hitting record highs above $73,500 in March, CME futures continue to trade at an annualized three-month premium of over 10%, according to Velo Data. In other words, carry trades still yield at least twice as much as the 10-year Treasury note, which offered a so-called risk-free return of 4.36% at press time. That said, some hedge funds may have taken outright bearish bets as recent robust U.S. economic data and hawkish comments from the Fed officials weakened the case for rapid-fire interest-rate cuts in the near term. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell emphasized the need to see how inflation evolves in the coming months, keeping the timing of the first-rate cut uncertain. Since the release of upbeat manufacturing data on Monday, the probability of the Fed cutting rates in June has dropped below 50%. In addition, some observers are skeptical that the impending mining reward halving will live up to its bullish reputation. The Bitcoin blockchain's fourth mining reward halving, due later this month, reduces the per-block amount of BTC issued as a reward to miners to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC. Historically, bitcoin has chalked out major bull runs 12 to 18 months after halving, when the reduced per-block emission met demand. If past data is a guide, the path of least resistance is higher. However, according to David Duong, head of institutional research at Coinbase, the small sample size makes it difficult to draw definite conclusions in a market fundamentally altered by the January debut of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. "We believe that bitcoin’s market dynamics have fundamentally changed with the advent of U.S. spot BTC ETFs," Duong said in a market update last month. "Their multi-billion dollar net inflows in just two months have irrevocably altered the landscape. With major institutional players now capable of taking exposure through these vehicles, bitcoin's response to the upcoming halving may not necessarily mirror its performance in prior cycles." "We think studies of previous cycles should be interpreted cautiously, as the small sample size makes it difficult to generalize patterns here," he said. The launch of spot ETFs brought lifted bitcoin to record highs ahead of the halving, as opposed to previous cycles. That has left the door open for a post-halving price drop. Analysts at JPMorgan foresee bitcoin falling to $42,000 after the halving hype subsides. At press time, bitcoin changed hands near $66,000. Edited by Sheldon Reback.

With multi-chains support, including Ethereum and Arbitrum, OKX Wallet simplifies the management of ARB tokens across different networks, offering a seamless experience for users engaged in the decentralized ecosystems. Arbitrum is a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum developed by Offchain Labs. The New York-based company was founded by Ed Felten, a computer science professor at Princeton, Steven Goldfeder, a PhD graduate, and Harry Kalodner, a current PhD student at Princeton University. Designed to address some of the inherent limitations of Ethereum-based smart contracts, such as low efficiency and high execution costs, Arbitrum significantly reduces transaction costs and enhances user experience by avoiding the high gas fees typically associated with the Ethereum network. It processes transactions off the main Ethereum chain using Optimistic Rollup technology, which increases throughput and ensures transactions are executed more swiftly while maintaining the full security of the Ethereum mainnet. ARB is the governance token of the Arbitrum layer-2 blockchain, developed by Offchain Labs in 2021 to enhance Ethereum’s scalability. Although ARB tokens are not used to pay transaction fees on the Arbitrum chain, they hold significant use cases, primarily in governance and network decision-making. As of May 10, 2024, ARB has a market capitalization of $2,758,848,660, per CoinMarketCap data. It is priced at $1.04, sitting 56.43% below its all-time high of $2.40 (reached in January 2024). When selecting an Arbitrum (ARB) wallet, look for robust security features such as 2FA, end-to-end encryption, and hardware support. Here are other factors to be on the lookout for: The process of setting up a crypto wallet is simple and tends to be similar regardless of the wallet you choose. For this example, we’ll use the CoinEx Wallet. Here’s a quick walkthrough to get you started: 2. Creating a strong password is crucial when setting up your wallet. This should be a unique combination of letters, numbers, and special characters you have not used elsewhere. 3. During the wallet setup process, you will be prompted to write down mnemonic words from one to 12. Recording these words in a safe place offline. Note that your account may be irretrievable afterward if you lose this phrase. 4. Voila! After setting up your wallet, you can add ARB by going to the network selection area. The best Arbitrum wallet is the one that most suits your individual needs and requirements. Consider your investment goals. Are you looking to hold ARB long-term? If so, a hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor makes the most sense. Those looking to trade ARB and have instant access to holdings may prefer a hot wallet like the Coinbase Wallet, OKX Wallet, or CoinEx Wallet. Regardless of the storage solution you choose, ensure to prioritize crypto wallet security at all times. Wallets like Ledger, Trezor, Coinbase Wallet, CoinEx Wallet, and OKX Wallet can hold assets on the Arbitrum network.

They used “prebiotic feedstocks” like water and nitrogen to trace how early compounds eventually led to human existence. The researchers, operating out of the Institute of Organic Chemistry in Poland, first published an article in Science in 2020 in which they created a version of this network — albeit one with limitations. The Golem network, operating as a layer-2 distributed computing platform, enabled the researchers to construct a network that was 100,000 times larger than their initial attempt. Read more: We need to decentralize science In a paper published in the academic journal Chem, the researchers detail how this “counterintuitive marriage” between crypto and origins of life research allowed them to pull off a far bigger version of the network without needing access to supercomputing resources. Golem’s network operates on a peer-to-peer basis, where individuals can rent out their idle computing power in exchange for GLM tokens, the native cryptocurrency of the Golem network. The researchers simulated 11 billion reactions comprising 20,000 CPU cores on Golem. They paid out 82,000 GLM to the computing power providers which translated to roughly $38,000 at the time. At GLM’s current price, the tokens would be worth roughly $17,000. In the article, the research team estimates that running the simulation with Web2 cloud providers would have cost $80,000. Crowdfunding-like approaches to academic research are one of crypto’s burgeoning use cases. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has been selling off 2% of his COIN equity to fund ResearchHub. The “GitHub for scientists” funds research by doing things like paying for peer reviews. Its native ResearchCoin appreciated by 1000% in late 2023.

This reduction in mining difficulty took place amidst a decline in Bitcoin’s price, which fell to $40,500 on the night of December 11. This marks the first decrease in Bitcoin’s mining difficulty since mid-September 2023, as reported by BTC.com. Changes in this metric are significant as they influence the timing of the upcoming halving, anticipated in April 2024. The previous adjustment to this metric was on November 26, 2023, when there was a 5.07% increase from its former level, with the hashrate at that time being 480.85 EH/s. The forthcoming adjustment in mining difficulty is provisionally set for December 23, 2023. BTC.com predicts a minor reduction of 0.12%. It’s noteworthy that since mid-September, the average hashrate on the Bitcoin network has been predominantly on the rise. According to an expert from PlanB, this trend is attributed to ETF issuers. The analyst also notes that large corporations purchasing Bitcoin directly from miners tend to affect its price, often leading to a simultaneous increase in the hashrate. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

102::https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-miners-depin-profitability/::Crypto Briefing::article::DePIN is a lifeline for Bitcoin miners, says Livepeer CEO::DePIN offers a new revenue stream for Bitcoin miners post-halving. Fostering development::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Bitcoin (BTC) miners might turn to the DePIN ecosystem to turn mining facilities profitable after the latest halving cut block rewards to 3.125 BTC, shared Livepeer CEO Doug Petkanics with Crypto Briefing. DePIN is short for decentralized physical infrastructure network, a blockchain industry sector that brings transparency and decentralization to the real world. Petkanics highlights that this movement to DePIN, where the business model is usually providing computing power through GPUs to artificial intelligence-focused companies, is met with good and bad news for Bitcoin miners. “The hardware that they’ve bought and deployed and paid for Bitcoin mining are really specific to Bitcoin. Their ASICs, they can only mine Bitcoin. They can only do that specific cash function. They really can’t be redeployed into other networks. I think that’s the bad news. But that’s not surprising. That’s what they knew their investment was and they knew they were optimizing for.” On the opposite side, the expertise and surrounding infrastructure that the facilities built up around mining crypto are really efficient when it comes to energy usage, bandwidth, and operational management, Petkanics points out. This characteristics can be proven useful when managing a The expectation after the April 20 halving is that electricity and overall production costs will nearly double, according to a report by asset management firm CoinShares. The report also sheds light on that mining companies like BitDigital, Hive, and Hut 8 are already generating income from artificial intelligence (AI). “All that expertise and resources absolutely can be repurposed into one of the sort of biggest opportunities of this point in time that we’re in right now, due to the just massive amount of computing resources that are going to be required when it comes to this paradigm shift of artificial intelligence models being this new technology that’s changing everything about how people interact with technology.” According to Livepeer CEO, decentralized computing power networks offer benefits in different layers. The first is related to how the GPU market is organized, where tech firms must buy large batches of graphic chips to achieve a cheaper acquisition price. However, these companies usually don’t have immediate usage for all the GPU acquired, and that’s where DePIN shows its potential by letting computing power be lent. “I think that actually fits really neatly into this notion that decentralized networks can let anyone who’s paid for that capacity, but has it sitting idle, make it available to developers that want to use it temporarily via open marketplaces.” Moreover, the necessity to buy large batches of GPU is also a threshold to companies such as data centers and infrastructure providers. This is also another issue that can be solved by DePIN, as these smaller companies can tap into the dormant capacities of these idle graphic chips via an open marketplace, Petkanics underscored. “You don’t have the overhead or the bureaucracy of needing contracts and customer relationships and sales and the stuff that adds a lot of cost on top of just sort of connecting directly to the computing power.” Share this article The information on or accessed through this website is obtained from independent sources we believe to be accurate and reliable, but Decentral Media, Inc. makes no representation or warranty as to the timeliness, completeness, or accuracy of any information on or accessed through this website.

103::https://theconversation.com/how-bitcoin-futures-trading-could-burst-the-cryptocurrencys-bubble-88971::The Conversation::article::How Bitcoin futures trading could burst the cryptocurrency’s bubble::Futures trading is driving up the price of Bitcoin but institutional investors remain cautious.::A new wave was added to the never-ending Bitcoin mania when the Chicago Board of Exchange (CBOE) became the first major derivative exchange to launch Bitcoin futures on December 10. Such was the euphoria among early investors that trading was halted twice due to CBOE speed breakers, which slow or pause trading when price movements are excessive. The launch of Bitcoin futures at CBOE is set to be followed by its cross-town rival, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, which plans to launch its own version of Bitcoin futures trading on December 18. And Nasdaq is preparing for a similar launch in the second-half of 2018. Bitcoin futures allows traders to speculate on what the Bitcoin price will be at a later date. For instance, at the time of writing this article, the January contract for Bitcoin was trading around US$18,300, up from an opening price of US$15,000. Traders bet on this and profit accordingly. Such was the excitement at the launch of futures that the Bitcoin price touched an all-time high of US$17,382.64 after one day of CBOE trading. This might sound good for Bitcoin lovers, but it could yet spell doom for the cryptocurrency in the long run. Bitcoin futures could actually end up reducing the price of Bitcoin. Futures trading gives new investors the choice to bet against Bitcoin and also allows them to settle contracts in dollars, boosting their liquidity. Plus, Bitcoin futures allows investors to trade off the cryptocurrency without actually owning it. This protects them from any volatility in the real-time spot market. This could reduce the demand for Bitcoin, pushing down prices. Even though crypto futures are new to the market, futures contract trading dates back to ancient times. In 1750BC in Mesopotamia the Babylonian king, Hammurabi, introduced a legal code, which included stipulations for trading goods at a future date for an agreed-upon price. A futures contract, in its simplest form, is an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a future date at an agreed-upon price. One party to the contract agrees to buy a given quantity of securities (such as stocks or bonds) or commodities (oil, gold, Bitcoin), and take the delivery on a future date while the other party agrees to deliver the asset. Futures markets involve hedgers and speculators. Hedgers are concerned with protecting themselves from future price drops. Hedgers will buy or sell their commodity to lock in a price against future risks of it dropping in value. Speculators assume the risk, often borrowing a substantial amount of money to buy contracts that they hope will go up in the future. If the market moves against them, they will lose more than they invested. One key requirement of futures contracts is that they must be traded on standardised exchanges such as the CBOE or CME. The arrival of Bitcoin futures at an established and well-regulated derivative exchange will encourage more investors to trade in digital currency, giving Bitcoin a place among mainstream finance. Even household names including Goldman Sachs have said they plan to clear Bitcoin futures on behalf of some clients. This will fuel the cryptocurrency’s price rise, as crypto traders and dealers can hedge their positions based on the future market. For example Bitcoin miners will benefit from futures contracts as they can use them to hedge against their mining cost, getting money in advance from speculators hoping to make a future profit. On the flip side, the launch of Bitcoin futures will attract greater scrutiny from the regulators which will cast a shadow on the fate of the Bitcoin in the long run. In this regard, the trade association for the futures markets, the Futures Industry Association warned the US regulator that not enough risk evaluation has been done on Bitcoin and the risks it poses to financial stability. The launch of Bitcoin futures has aggravated other regulators, with scrutiny beginning to encircle the cryptocurrency. Hong Kong’s regulator issued a warning that only licensed firms can offer such products within Hong Kong. In Korea, the Financial Services Commission financial regulator issued a directive that bans securities firms from taking part in Bitcoin futures transactions. Perhaps more worryingly, the levels of futures trading has not been as high as the initial flurry of excitement may suggest. The volume of trading since bitcoin’s launch on CBOE has been relatively low, especially compared with more established currencies futures. So, although Bitcoin has the added legitimacy of being traded on futures exchanges, the relatively low levels of interest from big institutional investors is indicative. If history is anything to go by, the tulip bubble burst in February 1637 – not long after the Dutch created a futures market for buying bulbs in 1636 at the peak of tulip mania. The advent of futures trading may well further inflate the “Bitcoin bubble” and push it to its bursting point.::2017-12-13T16:14:41Z::Bitcoin, Commodities, Cryptocurrency, Currencies, Investment, Trading::Nafis Alam::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/199000/original/file-20171213-27555-auyx8h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C568%2C5501%2C2751&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

Yet, Binance is not just a trading platform offering indicators, trading tools, and tradable assets. It is also a one-stop on-ramping/ offramping platform, helping users convert their hard-earned money to crypto and vice versa. With Binance P2P, users can directly buy and sell crypto in an open market. This Binance P2P guide takes you through how the process works and how to navigate the P2P space safely. P2P stands for peer-to-peer. P2P crypto transactions signify the transfer of assets between two people without a middleman. Even though Binance is typically a middleman when you execute spot and limit trades, charging marker and taker fees along the way, it has a separate P2P section to fulfill the individual-specific crypto supply and demand. Low transaction fees, privacy protection, and secure transactions are just some of the advantages of trading on #Binance P2P. pic.twitter.com/uvo41ATKD3 Think of P2P as selling your crypto directly to a person and receiving cash (bank transfers) in return. Here’s how the process is initiated on any peer-to-peer crypto exchange: This is what a simplified version of a peer-to-peer transaction looks like. Even though the concept of P2P holds for any peer-to-peer crypto exchange, Binance offers additional anonymity and a wide selection of tradable assets. You can buy BTC and other crypto assets using direct payment methods or sell USDT, BNB, or a host of other cryptos and get paid directly into your e-wallet or bank account. Binance P2P buying and selling makes life easier for users who receive their salary or fee in crypto, want to initiate quick trades, offload assets quickly, and make quick crypto purchases to ride market sentiments, among other things. Of course, Binance isn’t the only P2P crypto exchange in town. Several Binance alternatives include the likes of OKX, Paxful, and Hodl Hodl. This Binance P2P guide/explainer will highlight how a few simple components comprise the entire P2P architecture. Here are the underlying elements. To use Binance’s P2P functionality, you first need to create a basic user account. Note that peer-to-peer account setup requires stringent KYC verification, regardless of whether you are a buyer or a seller. You can enhance your Binance P2P buying, selling, or rather trading profile by relying on ads. These advertisements position your P2P need at the top of the list, allowing buyers and sellers to locate you quickly. Notably, placing ads comes with a few conditions: Did you know? When setting up your advertisement, you can choose between a “Buy” or “Sell” ad type, select the crypto asset and fiat currency, and choose between fixed or floating pricing. Additionally, you can specify the total trading amount, order limits, and up to three payment methods. You also have the flexibility to add terms and an auto-reply message when users respond to your ad. As for the changes, new trade advertisements can be subjected to transaction fees, anywhere between 0 and 0.35%, depending on the pair’s liquidity. In Binance P2P, the pair signifies the crypto you wish to trade and the currency you wish to offload or purchase it in. The entire buyer-seller interaction on Binance is managed by an escrow. Here is how it works: Once a buyer accepts an offer, the seller’s cryptocurrency is automatically locked in Binance’s escrow service. This escrow holds the crypto securely until the transaction is completed, ensuring that the seller does not lose their crypto if the buyer fails to pay. Binance P2P payment methods range from standard bank transfers to UPI (India-specific) to e-wallets and others. “Bharat Web3 Association shared a video with RBI on Binance P2P trades and then requested the central bank to permit the resumption of UPI/payment services for the VDA (crypto) sector. Soon you can expect a crack down on Binance P2P use in India or resumption of UPI services.” As someone looking to buy or sell USDT or any other cryptocurrency, you can tweak and choose the Binance P2P payment methods depending on your region of operation. The seller leads the fund-release mechanism and must confirm the payment. Once done, the Binance P2P escrow releases the digital assets to the buyer’s wallet. This issue will be there, without P2P. With P2P, this risk shifts to the seller. Because then, funds will be received in Bank account of seller of crypto. That is why we see many Binance users complaining that bank account is frozen. Here is how the process works: When you initiate a transaction on Binance P2P, the crypto that’s being sold is temporarily transferred to Binance’s escrow service. This secure holding continues until the buyer has paid and confirmed it within the platform. Once the seller confirms receiving the payment, Binance releases the cryptocurrency from escrow to the buyer. If any disputes arise, either party can initiate an appeal, which leads to an investigation by Binance’s customer support to resolve the issue and decide the rightful owner of the funds. The escrow mechanism functions by automatically reserving the cryptocurrency when an advertisement for selling crypto is posted. This amount is deducted from the seller’s funding wallet and held securely by Binance. If a buyer marks a transaction as paid but fails to transfer the funds, or if there’s any other dispute, the seller can appeal, and Binance will hold the crypto in escrow until the issue is resolved based on the provided evidence. This escrow system ensures that transactions are safe and minimizes the risk of scams and theft, which is crucial given the irreversible nature of cryptocurrency transactions. The service also incorporates identity verification measures to ensure that all users trade under their true identities, enhancing the platform’s overall security. In cases where there is a dispute — such as a buyer claiming that the payment was made but the seller not releasing the cryptocurrency — the involved parties can file an appeal. It’s shocking – So many people are reporting that they used P2P which resulted in Bank account freeze. These are only 50% of the messages that I received on x. Have even more on email. Will be making a detailed video on this topic soon covering : Steps to follow, how to get… pic.twitter.com/fN5eGOGJyv Other concerns like bank account freeze, chargeback placements, and more can also be raised using Binance’s dispute resolution mechanism. Binance’s customer service then steps in to resolve the dispute based on evidence provided by both sides, such as payment receipts or chat logs. If you want to buy or sell USDT or any other crypto, you should check the feedback and rating before proceeding. You can find the details by clicking on the buyer profile. The P2P page also has other tabs — Express, Block, Cash, and P2P. Each refers to a different kind of peer-to-peer cryptocurrency order type. The P2P Express Zone simplifies the trading process by allowing you to place orders quickly by entering the fiat amount you want to buy or sell. The system then matches you with the best available order from a verified merchant. This method best suits crypto novices and those starting out their P2P journey. The Block Trade Zone is for users interested in making large-volume trades. This zone ensures that such trades are handled securely, typically involving verified merchants known as block traders. At some specific locations, certain buyers might provide cash-based selling facilities. However, you must deal in a safe environment to avoid getting scammed. #Binance P2P Supports Cash-in-Person Transactions as a Payment Method ➡️ https://t.co/EKhvgIcAAw pic.twitter.com/Uqjb7oVZ1h It is important to check how all these elements pertaining to the Binance P2P architecture work in unison. Here are the steps to consider: If you want to buy crypto using the Binance P2P interface, you can click on the “Buy” tab, and at first, you will see the advertisements. If you like an offer posted by the seller — preferred rates and payment methods — you need to hit the “Buy” button against the seller’s name. Do note that as the buyer, you can raise a cancellation request first. You can then verify the seller credentials, maximum amount, past orders, and more on their profile page. If you want to sell, you need to connect with a buyer. If you plan to sell USDT or any other supported crypto, you are the one in charge of the assets. Only when you confirm receipt of the funds will the buyer receive the relevant digital assets. Before that happens, the cryptocurrency is held securely by the Binance Escrow. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) support a form of peer-to-peer (P2P) trading. However, they operate differently from traditional P2P platforms like those provided by centralized exchanges (CEXs). In DEXs, the P2P aspect is inherent in the technology — traders interact directly with each other via blockchain-based smart contracts rather than through a managed platform that facilitates trades with traditional order books. Do note that DEX-based P2Ps are more like token swaps as to off-ramp, you will always need a CEX. However, cash-based P2P transactions — also known as F2F or face-to-face transactions — can be initiated using DEXs. The Binance P2P interface comes with a host of features. Some of the most obvious ones include: You can consider these features as the Binance P2P trading benefits. P2P transactions seem easy. Yet, they have their own share of pitfalls. Here’s what to be aware of: Genuine P2P concerns: 3/ Identified accounts at Noones and Paxful (P2P marketplaces) that received funds from the hacks and were used to convert crypto to fiat. pic.twitter.com/0O3V726dAq Tax obligations for P2P transactions can be unclear and vary by jurisdiction, complicating compliance for users who may not understand their tax liabilities from crypto trading. For instance, if you are from India and filing taxes, you must report the nature of your crypto dealings, including P2P. CA Sonu Jain, a crypto tax specialist, spoke with BeInCrypto about tax-specific approaches toward P2P trading and how an average trader could navigate these scam-filled waters. “Investors who are engaged in P2P trading should be cautious when dealing with unknown individuals online. Investors in India, for example, can take some of the below steps to mitigate the risk of fraud: These steps although may sound lengthy and difficult, but they will help you stay away from scammers & deal with genuine Investors.” In some cases, Binance hasn’t fully cooperated with the authorities to quell concerns related to anti-money laundering and scams. Several subsidiaries like the Binance U.S. may have P2P restrictions on them due to (a lack of) regulatory oversight. As a buyer or seller, you should take note of this before proceeding. Nigeria's Central Bank has now prohibited banks from processing #bitcoin and cryptocurrency transactions. The country ranks second in P2P #bitcoin volume. pic.twitter.com/2bSXoPv6h6 In the world of P2P, security must be a top priority. Here are a few safety tips to follow: This Binance P2P guide shows the ease with which users can conduct peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions. However, in light of the growing prevalence of scams and the need for greater regulatory innovation, we expect this peer-to-peer crypto exchange to move to offer additional security standards, like anomaly detection and enhanced encryption. Furthermore, in the future, Binance is likely to increasingly rely on AI for more optimized order-matching experiences, especially for crypto newcomers. Binance P2P can be profitable, especially for those who act as merchants on the platform. Merchants earn by posting trading ads and completing trades, benefiting from low-fee structures, and sometimes participating in special promotions. The platform’s zero trading fees policy ensures that traders can maximize their returns without deductions for transaction fees, enhancing profitability. Plus, if you regularly indulge in Binance P2P trading, you can even earn using the frequent disparities between the buying and selling prices of USDT or any other supported crypto. Binance P2P is generally considered safe. It uses an escrow service to hold the cryptocurrencies until both parties confirm the transaction’s completion, providing a layer of security against fraud. However, there has been a recent rise in the number of P2P-led scams, with some buyers sending disputed funds to the sellers, leading to the latter being targeted by the authorities. Even though Binance doesn’t explicitly offer P2P services in the U.S. due to regulatory challenges, some users rely on VPNs to locate cash-based zones. However, this is not safe and not recommended considering Binance’s sophisticated location-tracking tools.

106::https://blockworks.co/news/coinbase-blockchain-association-fincen-mixers::Blockworks::article::Coinbase, Blockchain Association challenge FinCEN’s proposed mixer crackdown ::FinCEN’s proposed rule could stigmatize legitimate crypto activity and drive illicit transactions abroad, Blockchain Association says.::FinCEN’s proposed rule could stigmatize legitimate crypto activity and drive illicit transactions abroad, Blockchain Association says Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith | DAS 2022 for Blockworks Several industry players have objected to a federal agency’s attempt to crack down on crypto mixing services, with one advocacy group calling the proposal “fundamentally flawed.” The US Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) proposed in October to classify what it calls convertible virtual currency mixing, or CVC mixing, as “a class of transactions of primary money laundering concern.” The proposal is FinCEN’s first-ever use of its authority to target a transactions class as such. Read more: FinCEN seeks tighter controls on crypto mixing services Mixing is a process that blends different crypto transactions to obscure the original source — making it more difficult to trace specific transactions. FinCEN director Andrea Gacki said in an October statement that crypto mixing “allows players in the ransomware ecosystem, rogue state actors and other criminals to fund their unlawful activities and obfuscate the flow of ill-gotten gains.” Marisa Coppel, head of legal at Blockchain Association, said in a statement that FinCEN’s proposal is “far too broad in scope and application.” In a Jan. 22 letter responding to the proposal, the Blockchain Association argued that FinCEN’s failure to consider the many legitimate uses of crypto mixing makes it “makes it impossible for the agency to rationally conclude that the class is of primary money laundering concern.” “CVC mixing protocols help law-abiding individuals achieve on the otherwise public blockchain the privacy typical of transactions in the traditional banking system,” the group wrote. “There is nothing inherently suspicious about desiring the same degree of privacy available for traditional financial transactions.” FinCEN’s decision to impose reporting requirements on CVC mixing transactions “will stigmatize broad swathes of legitimate digital asset activity, impose significant costs on the digital asset industry and drive illicit digital asset transactions abroad,” Blockchain Association added. Coinbase also challenged the proposal in a Jan. 22 letter. The crypto exchange noted that regulated virtual asset service providers (VASPs) are already required to file suspicious activity reports on illicit mixing activity. “The NPRM fails to explain why these existing requirements are inadequate to FinCEN’s purposes,” Coinbase wrote. The company added in the letter that the FinCEN proposal does not include any monetary threshold for record-keeping and reporting obligations — leading to “bulk reporting of data of little help to law enforcement.” FinCEN could not immediately be reached. The FinCEN proposal comes after the US Treasury Department added decentralized cryptocurrency mixing service Tornado Cash to its sanctions list in August 2022. A year later, the company’s co-founders, Roman Semenov and Roman Storm, were charged with US federal money laundering and sanctions violations. Read more: Tornado Cash plaintiffs seek appeals after federal court losses Coinbase is no stranger to challenging federal agencies amid a broader crackdown on the crypto space. The publicly traded crypto company remains in a legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission after the regulator last year sued Coinbase for allegedly operating as an unregistered exchange — claims the company has denied. “This [proposal] comes at a time of enormous opportunity for the United States to lead the world in digital asset innovation,” Coinbase wrote in its latest letter to FinCEN. “But this opportunity depends in significant part on US regulators, like FinCEN, creating a regulatory landscape that fosters the growth of compliant companies while holding accountable those that fail to meet their obligations.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

Last month, a significant increase in the sale of freshly mined Bitcoin by public miners was recorded. Reports indicate that 13 major mining companies sold more Bitcoin than they generated in October, despite the cryptocurrency’s 26% gain for the month. Data from TheMinerMag reveal that the sell-to-production ratio for key players, such as Marathon Digital Holdings and Core Scientific Inc., breached the 100% mark. This suggests they not only sold all of their Bitcoin mined in October but also dipped into their existing reserves. Companies like Hut 8 and Bit Digital went even further, liquidating over 300% of their mined Bitcoin in the same month. This leap to a 105% sell-to-production ratio marks a sharp contrast to the 64%, 77%, and 77% ratios seen in July, August, and September respectively. Bitcoin miners are gearing up for the upcoming halving event. The reason for this accelerated sell-off is twofold: to take advantage of the recent price rise of Bitcoin and to engage in strategic financial preparation before the next “halving” expected early the following year. The halving event will cut the rewards for mining Bitcoin by half, prompting miners to bolster their cash reserves by selling a portion of their Bitcoin assets. By increasing their BTC sales, miners are proactively strengthening their financial standings to cope with the soon-to-decrease mining rewards. This careful planning is crucial for maintaining their operational flow and securing a sustainable future in the unpredictable crypto market. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

Share this article Gnosis, a blockchain infrastructure project advocating for radical inclusivity, has announced the launch of Genome, a digital ID service native to the Gnosis Chain. Public Registration is now live! 🚀 Missed the pre-registration? No worries – now ANYONE can register their .gno domains: https://t.co/afo44sro6d https://t.co/zxHpOnvmfZ — Genome (.gno domains) (@genomedomains) May 15, 2024 Developed in collaboration with Web3 domain and identity platform SpaceID and Web3 messaging protocol dm3, Genome allows users to translate their lengthy, technical wallet addresses into human-readable names, making it easier to send and receive transactions and interact within the Gnosis ecosystem. Genome automatically grants users ownership of both .GNO and .gnosis.eth names, providing a seamless, interoperable user journey within Gnosis across EVM-compatible blockchains. The service synchronizes across Gnosis dApps, communities, and social networks, giving users a single identity and login that they can use across various services. Genome is also fully interoperable with the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), enabling users to claim ownership of two domain names simultaneously. “From payments to gaming to SocialFi, if Web3 is going to fulfill its promises, we need to accelerate interoperable on-chain communication and identification tools,” shares Friederike Ernst, co-founder of Gnosis. Genome is integrated with various applications on Gnosis Chain, such as Gnosis Pay and Circles, as well as other blockchain utilities like Blockscout and NiftyFair. The integration ensures that users are able to maintain a consistent identity across multiple platforms, enhancing interoperability. According to Ralph Xu, a Business Development Specialist at Gnosis, the main differentiator between Genome .gno domains and other products is the custom ENS resolver developed by the DM3 Protocol team. The resolver pairs the .gno domain on Gnosis Chain with a corresponding subdomain on Ethereum, allowing one to be the extension of the other on a different chain. This is made possible through CCIP L2 (cross-chain interoperability) and off-chain resolution, which points to an off-chain server and then to the smart contracts on Gnosis Chain, relaying the information back to Ethereum. The launch of Genome aligns with Gnosis’ vision of inclusivity through accessible, open infrastructure. The project has opened registration for a .gno or .gnosis.eth username to the public.

109::https://theconversation.com/the-utopian-currency-bitcoin-is-a-potentially-catastrophic-energy-guzzler-88871::The Conversation::article::The ‘utopian’ currency Bitcoin is a potentially catastrophic energy guzzler::Bitcoin has been viewed as a liberating path out of the corporate monetary system. But the process of ‘mining’ the cryptocurrency is a massive energy drain - and potential environmental disaster.::The recent upsurge in the price of Bitcoin seems to have finally awakened the world to the massively destructive environmental consequences of this bubble. These consequences were pointed out as long ago as 2013 by Australian sustainability analyst and entrepreneur Guy Lane, executive director of the Long Future Foundation. In recent months, the Bitcoin bubble has got massively bigger and the associated waste of energy is now much more widely recognised. In essence, the creation of a new Bitcoin requires the performance of a complex calculation that has no value except to show that it has been done. The crucial feature, as is common in cryptography, is that the calculation in question is very hard to perform but easy to verify once it’s done. At present, the most widely used estimate of the energy required to “mine” Bitcoins is comparable to the electricity usage of New Zealand, but this is probably an underestimate. If allowed to continue unchecked in our current energy-constrained, climate-threatened world, Bitcoin mining will become an environmental disaster. In the early days of Bitcoin, the necessary computations could be performed on ordinary personal computers. But now, “miners” use purpose-built machines optimised for the particular algorithms used by Bitcoin. With these machines, the primary cost of the system is the electricity used to run it. That means, of course, that the only way to be profitable as a Bitcoin miner is to have access to the cheapest possible electricity. Read more: Demystifying the blockchain: a basic user guide Most of the time that means electricity generated by burning cheap coal in old plants, where the capital costs have long been written off. Bitcoin mining today is concentrated in China, which still relies heavily on coal. Even in a large grid, with multiple sources of electricity, Bitcoin mining effectively adds to the demand for coal-fired power. Bitcoin computers run continuously, so they constitute a “baseload” demand, which matches the supply characteristics of coal. More generally, even in a process of transition to renewables, any increase in electricity demand at the margin may be regarded as slowing the pace at which the dirtiest coal-fired plants can be shut down. So Bitcoin mining is effectively slowing our progress towards a clean energy transition - right at the very moment we need to be accelerating. A widely used estimate by Digiconomist suggests that the Bitcoin network currently uses around 30 terawatt-hours (TWh) a year, or 0.1% of total world consumption – more than the individual energy use of more than 150 countries. By contrast, in his 2013 analysis, Guy Lane estimated that a Bitcoin price of US$10,000 would see that energy use figure climb to 80 TWh. If the current high price is sustained for any length of time, Lane’s estimate will be closer to the mark, and perhaps even conservative. The cost of electricity is around 5c per kilowatt-hour for industrial-scale users. Miners with higher costs have mostly gone out of business. As a first approximation, Bitcoin miners will spend resources (nearly all electricity) equal to the price of a new Bitcoin. However, to be conservative, let’s assume that only 75% of the cost of Bitcoin mining arises from electricity. Assuming an electricity price of 5c per kWh and a Bitcoin price of US$10,000, this means that each Bitcoin consumes about 150 megawatt-hours of electricity. Under current rules, the settings for Bitcoin allow the mining of 1,800 Bitcoins a day, implying daily use of 24,000MWh or an annual rate of nearly 100TWh – about 0.3% of all global electricity use. Roughly speaking, each MWh of coal-fired electricity generation is associated with a tonne of carbon dioxide emissions, so a terawatt-hour corresponds to a million tonnes of CO₂. An obvious comparison is with the existing financial system. Digiconomics estimated that Visa is massively more efficient in processing transactions. A supporter of Bitcoin, Carlos Domingo, hit back with a calculation suggesting that the entire global financial system uses about 100TWh per year, or three times as much as the Diginconomics estimate for Bitcoin. As a defence, this is far from impressive. First, as we’ve seen, if the current high price is sustained, total annual energy use from Bitcoin mining is also likely to rise to 100TWh. Read more: The bitcoin and blockchain: energy hogs More importantly, the global financial system serves the entire world. By contrast, the number of active Bitcoin investors has been estimated at 3 million. Almost all of these people are pure speculators, holding Bitcoin as an asset while using the standard financial system for all of their private and business transactions. Another group is believed to use Bitcoin for illicit purposes such as drug dealing or money laundering, before converting these funds into their own national currency. The number of people who routinely use Bitcoin as a currency for legitimate transactions might be in the low thousands or perhaps even fewer. Shifting the whole global financial system to Bitcoin would require at least a 2000-fold increase, which in turn would entail increasing the the world’s electricity use by around 500%. With the current threat of climate change looming large globally - this constitutes an unthinkably large amount of energy consumption. The disastrous nature of Bitcoin’s energy consumption should not lead us to abandon the associated idea of blockchain technology altogether. There are alternatives to the “proof of work” method of validating changes to the blockchain, such as “proof of importance”, which is analogous to Google’s page ranking systems. Projects such as Gridcoin are based on calculations that are actually useful to science. But these ideas are in their infancy. For the moment, the problem is Bitcoin and how to deal with it. There is no obvious way to fix the inherent problems in its design. The sooner this collective delusion comes to an end, the better.::2017-12-11T04:58:07Z::Bitcoin, Climate change, Electricity::John Quiggin::Environment ,  Energy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/198475/original/file-20171211-27719-sl548l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

If approved, the Monochrome Bitcoin ETF could be the first spot bitcoin ETF in Australia which allows direct holding of bitcoin. Australia already has two exchange-traded products providing exposure to spot crypto assets on Cboe Australia but they do not hold bitcoin directly. The Monochrome Bitcoin ETF is a flagship product of the firm. It could have also been listed with Cboe Australia's larger rival, ASX, where larger volumes are available. In January 2024, Monochrome Asset Management's head of legal and compliance Derek Vladimir Henningsen told CoinDesk that they anticipated their bitcoin ETF would be listed in the second quarter of the year. The announcement said the firm selected Cboe Australia as the listing venue for its bitcoin ETF because it aligns with its strategic goals to work with a market operator with an established reputation, strategic position and expertise across Asia, and broader investor access. In Australia, unlike the U.S., firms have to first get approval from the regulator, the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC), and then apply to an exchange for listing the product. Monochrome has already got approval from ASIC for its product. "We expect a decision from Cboe Australia about our bitcoin ETF application before the middle of the year," said Jeff Yew, Monochrome Asset Management CEO. Cboe Australia is one of five of Cboe Global Markets' global listings exchanges. Read More: Bitcoin ETFs in and Around Asia After U.S. Approvals?

To learn more on how we evaluate each piece of content, please proceed to our verification methodology page LocalMonero, the platform that facilitated anonymous, no-KYC, P2P Monero (XMR) trades, has announced it is shutting down. And with it goes one of the last remaining bastions of truly anonymous P2P crypto services. The shuttering of the platform has expectedly raised concerns for privacy-conscious traders and investors as they scramble to find LocalMonero alternatives. In 2024, options are somewhat limited due to the relentless crackdown by global financial regulators on privacy coins and services. However, there are still a few LocalMonero alternatives out there that you may want to try out. Let’s take a quick look at some of these options. Everything was more or less normal with LocalMonero until May 7, 2024, when the platform announced that it was time to wind up operations permanently. LocalMonero didn’t offer any specific rationale behind the decision, although it briefly mentioned that a mix of “internal and external factors” led to it. While the announcement didn’t make any such reference, it is believed that growing hostility against privacy-centric crypto and blockchain products likely played a big role in forcing that move. Another domino is falling… 😥LocalMonero, the essential marketplace for buying/selling XMR peer-to-peer, is closing down without giving a reason. 🫡 https://t.co/788cFxdvjA So, where does it leave LocalMonero users now? Here’s a roundup: Essentially, the shutdown is effective immediately. Therefore, it’s crucial to find suitable LocalMonero alternatives quickly if you want to continue enjoying privacy-focused features for your XMR trades. LocalMonero has been a trusted platform for buying and selling XMR since 2017. Several factors contributed to its immense popularity. These include its ability to allow anonymous transactions while being backed by an end-to-end encryption messaging system. The platform hosted a wide spectrum of global traders, offering varying rates and payment options. You could filter buy and sell offers by your preferred country, payment method, and desired fiat/crypto pair. So make sure that whichever LocalMonero alternative you switch to offers most of these advantages — if not all. Primarily, you should look for a platform that: Additionally, the ideal LocalMonero alternative should offer you the option to buy and sell XMR for fiat. As of May 2024, not many LocalMonero alternatives meet these criteria. A tightening regulatory grip on privacy coins has squeezed some previously compliant platforms to abandon their user-friendly, anonymous approach when it comes to XMR and P2P. So, with those factors in mind, we do have to remind you that there are no real alternatives to LocalMonero — not yet, at least. These listed options are only those that come close. Bisq is definitely the closest it gets when it comes to LocalMonero alternatives. It is a decentralized trading platform that allows you to buy and sell XMR relatively easily. However, the interface is probably not as beginner-friendly as LocalMonero’s offering. Bisq doesn’t require you to go through KYC processes. It has a decent amount of liquidity for XMR trades — not nearly as high as what LocalMonero used to offer, but the odds are high that it will get there eventually, considering it is one of the few remaining options as of May 2024. Trades involving altcoins on Bisq typically have a default settlement period of one day. However, for those seeking faster transactions, Bisq offers an “Altcoins Instant” account option, which reduces the trade period to just one hour. This option is crucial for traders prioritizing speed and efficiency in their XMR transactions. The platform requires that Monero sellers actively provide proof of payment. This proof includes a transaction key, transaction ID, and the recipient’s address. This unique approach is required because Monero’s stringent privacy features obscure certain transaction details on the blockchain, which, in turn, complicates dispute resolution. Sellers can generate the proof from several compatible Monero wallets, including the official Monero GUI and CLI wallets, among others. Overall, this process ensures that in the event of a dispute, mediators or arbitrators have the necessary information to make a fair judgment. Bisq streamlines Monero transactions with an automated confirmation feature, expediting the verification of XMR payments. This feature eliminates the manual verification process for the buyer, which means the process only requires a valid transaction key from the seller and activation of this setting by the buyer. That said, manual confirmation remains an option if you prefer more old-school methods. Heads up before you read any further: Despite TradeOgre’s established presence and user base, the platform has raised red flags on multiple occasions in the past. It has faced criticism for its lack of transparency, and there have even been claims of users losing money due to alleged malpractices. So, make sure to do your research before trusting the TradeOgre with your money. The platform appears on this list because it is one of the few no-KYC platforms around that still supports XMR. The platform has been around since 2018. It claims to prioritize user anonymity and, therefore, doesn’t require any KYC verification. TradeOgre supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies, including XMR. It offers a simple, minimalistic user interface that makes processes easy for new users. It’s not the prettiest or the most modern interface, but it is functional and straightforward. You can buy XMR on TradeOgre using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or USDT. However, the platform does not support transactions via PayPal or credit cards. You only need an email address and a password to register. Once registered, you can deposit a compatible cryptocurrency and trade for Monero directly on the exchange. Additionally, users can store their Monero on TradeOgre or withdraw it to a private wallet if they are not actively trading. However, you can not buy Monero with physical cash directly through TradeOgre. Haveno is a promising but incomplete LocalMonero alternative. In fact, the LocalMonero shutdown announcement even mentioned it as one of the upcoming platforms to look out for. “Fortunately, the Monero ecosystem has matured a lot over these years, and with the imminent launch of Haveno and other DEXs like Serai, atomic swaps, the coming addition of FCMP (full blockchain anonymity set replacing rings of 16) as well as the continuing and rapidly accelerating development of the Monero protocol, we’re confident that Monero’s future is bright, with or without our platform.” Put simply, Haveno is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that leverages Monero’s privacy features to offer anonymous and secure trading. Haveno provides a platform for exchanging cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether, and Bitcoin Cash with fiat currencies such as USD, EUR, and GBP, all paired against XMR. The exchange is designed to be non-custodial, meaning users can retain control of their funds without undergoing KYC. As of May 2024, Haveno is still in development and not yet fully operational for public use. It’s anticipated to be ready by the end of 2024. The documentation for the Mainnet was released on May 12, 2024 — so there is a fair amount of work still to be done. If you have the skills, please consider jumping into the @HavenoDEX project to get the app developed to continue LocalMonero's cash in-person mission Desktop Haveno main net was technically released, but work remains, and the network is not standing up yet https://t.co/qlf9oxzq52 The platform will support a range of payment methods that do not require a bank account, like cash in person or cash by mail, which may greatly enhance its accessibility for peer-to-peer transactions. All said, Haveno remains a work in progress. Its future as a reliable trading platform depends on the completion of development and community acceptance. As this guide shows, Bisq stands out as the closest real LocalMonero alternative. Platforms like TradeOgre (despite its user base) and the in-development Haveno, while promising, lack the complete package LocalMonero provided. The abrupt closure of LocalMonero has certainly stirred significant activity within the privacy coin community. Regulatory pressure might be rising, but it’s also likely to further fuel innovation and ingenuity. There’s a strong likelihood that we will witness a surge of new platforms attempting to address these challenges and emerge as viable LocalMonero alternatives. We will continue to monitor these developments closely to keep you posted on any significant progress. Until then, weigh your options carefully before going all in. Peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto trading allows for direct transactions between individuals without the need for a centralized intermediary. This method of trading improves privacy and reduces transaction costs. P2P trades also offer greater control over the terms of trade and potentially better pricing due to the competitive nature of the marketplace. Additionally, P2P platforms often support a wide range of payment methods, making them accessible to a broader audience. When it comes to the best Monero trading platform, ideally you want something that doesn’t require KYC. Keep in mind that you will likely come across many “no-KYC” platforms that will later require you to go through KYC verification to access XMR transactions (or perhaps even their P2P services). No, LocalMonero did not require users to complete KYC procedures. This feature was key to its appeal as it allowed users to trade Monero anonymously, which was fitting for the privacy coin’s privacy-centric priorities.

112::https://blockworks.co/news/parallelized-evms-gaining-popularity::Blockworks::article::Parallelized EVMs are gaining popularity, but they won't scale blockchains alone::Parallel execution is a small fraction of the bigger picture.::Parallel execution is a small fraction of the bigger picture absemetov/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks Improving technology for scaling blockchains requires tackling multifaceted problems. New attempts to parallelize the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) have gained interest in recent weeks, as developers look for possibilities to increase transaction throughput. The EVM is the execution environment that runs on Ethereum and its layer-2 rollups, and also has been adopted by other layer-1 networks such Avalanche, Binance Chain and many others, which use it to process smart contract code. In typical EVM implementations, transactions are processed one after the other in the order they arrive. This simple approach can lead to longer processing times and higher costs when there are many transactions, explains Marina Guryeva, the CEO of Neon Labs, which is implementing the EVM as a smart contract on Solana. “For Ethereum, the traditional sequential execution model simplifies hardware requirements, but on the downside, it creates limitations in handling the increasing volume of transactions,” Guryeva told Blockworks. “This worsens during peak usage times resulting in longer transaction wait times, higher gas fees vis-a-vis demand surge, and an overall fractured user experience.” Guryeva said that much of the growing interest in parallel EVMs is due to its ability to tackle these challenges around blockchain scalability, addressing issues related to the blockchain trilemma. “The parallel processing approach addresses the longstanding challenges of scalability and transaction processing efficiency within the Ethereum network,” Guryeva said. Many transactions can be processed at the same time, instead of sequentially, so long as they don’t depend on each other. There are other ways to achieve parallel processing, such as at the database-level with approaches such as sharding, that essentially divide Ethereum’s state into smaller “shards” but full sharding remains years away. Read more: Dencun and Pralectra: Ethereum core devs chart an ambitious 2024 Parallelized EVMs, however, including the likes of Sei network, Monad and Neon, are already production ready or nearly so. The Sei network launched its mainnet in August 2023 and has seen recent monthly trading volume of about $136 million with a little over 29 thousand active DEX users, according to data compiled by Flipside Crypto. Its native token, SEI, has surged from around $0.23 at the beginning of December to around $0.68 today — an almost 200% jump. Neon too, has seen a significant increase in its token price, with NEON trading from $0.50 on Dec. 1 to roughly $2.55 today. Monad has yet to launch and does not yet have its own token. Much of the work being done on the Neon EVM is to bring the Ethereum dapps into the Solana ecosystem, Guryeva said. “It is a fully compatible Ethereum environment on Solana and allows developers to scale Ethereum dapps using Solana as the settlement layer,” she said. Guryeva notes that Ethereum remains the dominant blockchain that supports smart contracts and dapps, but Solana’s Sealevel technology — which enables virtual machines to process multiple transactions simultaneously through distributing transaction workload across multiple threads on a validator’s hardware — enables lower gas fees and higher scalability. Jay Jog the co-founder of Sei Labs shares this sentiment, he notes that Ethereum rollups struggle to get over 30 sustained transactions per second, which limits the design space on the blockchain. “A parallelized EVM lets you get the best of Ethereum and Solana — the EVM and all of the mindshare/tooling around it and the fast execution environment that Solana offers,” he said. Sei’s latest version has its EVM built into the chain, Jog added. “Sei uses Geth — the Go implementation of the EVM — to get full EVM bytecode compatibility. Geth is very battle tested and currently processes ~85% of [Ethereum] blocks,” he said. This is different from its competitor Monad, which is creating a custom EVM implementation, Jog notes. Despite these differences, both Monad and Sei are using optimistic parallel execution to achieve parallel processing. With this technique, virtual machines run in parallel on separate threads within the network computer. Each thread would execute transactions and generate what Keone Hon, the co-founder and CEO of Monad Labs, calls “pending results.” These pending results track the inputs and outputs of the transactions which are then committed back into their original linear order. If any pending result has inputs that have been invalidated, then a transaction must be rescheduled. “This means that Monad still supports linear blocks and linear transactions within the blocks,” Hon told Blockworks. “Monad can basically take transaction formats that are exactly the same as Ethereum and then, under the hood, implement parallelism without any changes from the user perspective.” Optimistic parallel execution is different from what Solana uses, for example, where dapps have to pre-specify dependencies of the transactions, Hon said, analogous to the access list approach on Ethereum. It is important to note, Hon adds, that parallel execution is a small fraction of the bigger picture, with Monad’s more general mission being centered around accelerating EVM execution to make it as performant as possible. “The real bottleneck is actually the state access that all of those transactions are being run, they all have dependencies on state, and that state lives on SSD (solid-state drive),” Hon said. The majority of smart contract work has relatively simple computation, he said, and bigger constraints for smart contracts are often the input/output component — the process of reading from the SSD and then writing back data. Parallelism only cuts a small fraction of costs, according to Rachel Bousfield, the tech lead at Offchain Labs, because parallel execution is rarely possible in practice across current Web3 dapps. Ethereum-like blockchains generally use commodity databases for reading and writing data. These have the advantage of being widely accessible, purchased “off the shelf,” but they are not optimized for the problem of storing the Merkle tree data, necessary for parallel processing on the blockchain, Hon notes. This means that, fundamentally, in order to decrease transaction processing times and gas prices, infrastructure around the database will have to change. “So one of the other really major things that Monad is building is a custom state database from scratch that supports parallel access so that when there are many threads running in parallel, touching the database — to get inputs, or write outbacks back to it — those can proceed in parallel,” Hon said. Monad is not alone in focusing on alleviating state dependencies. Sei too, is working to make improvements in this area, Jog notes. “We are doing a lot of work on the state layer to improve state access, state commit, and state storage,” he said.

Earlier this […]::The British Columbia Supreme Court has given the final judicial green light for the merger between Canadian Bitcoin mining heavyweight Hut 8 and U.S. Bitcoin Corp (USBTC), set to be finalized by the end of the year. This merger is expected to significantly influence both Bitcoin mining and the field of high-performance computing. Earlier this year, both companies announced plans to merge, subject to approvals from regulatory bodies and shareholders. The judicial approval was granted on September 18, clearing the last major legal hurdle. The emerging entity, provisionally dubbed “New Hut,” will be a publicly traded U.S. company that aims to significantly affect both Bitcoin mining and high-performance computing. It plans to operate with a capacity of 825 megawatts across six dedicated Bitcoin mining and data center sites, emphasizing the aggressive goals to become a major player in the Bitcoin mining sector. Before New Hut can officially launch, several remaining steps must be fulfilled, including a critical approval from USBTC shareholders. Upon finalization of the merger, New Hut’s stock will be available on both the Nasdaq and Toronto Stock Exchanges, trading under the ticker “HUT.” Shareholders will also need to complete administrative tasks to own shares of New Hut’s common stock. In terms of impact, the merger could boost the combined firm’s mining capabilities. Hut 8 and USBTC are among the biggest crypto mining companies in North America. Parallel to the merger developments, Hut 8 has also revised its operational plans. The company recently moved 6,400 ASIC mining rigs from an inactive facility in Ontario to Texas due to legal issues with energy provider Validus Power, reflecting Hut 8’s commitment to addressing increasing demands in fields like artificial intelligence and high-performance computing. Therefore, if all goes as planned, New Hut is poised to become a leading entity in the fast-changing worlds of Bitcoin mining and specialized computing. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

114::https://cryptobriefing.com/binance-address-poisoning-detection-algorithm/::Crypto Briefing::article::Binance develops algorithm to combat address poisoning scams::The algorithm identifies spoofed addresses by detecting suspicious transfers, such as those with near-zero value or unknown tokens.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Blockchain security researchers from Binance have developed an algorithm that could detect poisoned crypto addresses on both the BNB Smart Chain and Ethereum networks. Address poisoning is a type of scamming method in the crypto space where threat actors send small amounts of crypto from and address that resembles a victim’s address. The purpose of such an attach is to mislead the targeted user to mistakenly use this fake address for transactions, resulting in funds being sent to a scammer instead of the intended recipient. This attack preys on users’ carelessness, as they may overlook subtle differences in addresses. A recent incident of address poisoning led to the loss of $71 million worth of Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC), alarming the crypto industry on the prevalence and scale of damage that such methods could incur. Fortunately, the thief returned the funds on May 13, likely due to the public attention and investigations into their potential Hong Kong-based IP addresses. Binance’s algorithm identifies spoofed addresses by detecting suspicious transfers, such as those with near-zero value or unknown tokens, pairing them with potential victim addresses, and timestamping malicious transactions to pinpoint the potential point of poisoning. The spoofed addresses are then registered in the database of Web3 security firm HashDit, Binance’s security partner, to help protect the wider crypto industry from these scams. Address poisoning scams can be difficult to detect, as most traders only verify the first and last digits of the wallet’s 42 alphanumeric characters, and most protocols only display these digits. Scammers also use vanity address generators to customize their addresses, making them appear less random or more similar to a given address.

115::https://theconversation.com/bitcoin-may-be-reaching-new-heights-but-the-asx-shows-the-blockchain-is-reinventing-business-88937::The Conversation::article::Bitcoin may be reaching new heights, but the ASX shows the blockchain is reinventing business::While everyone has heard of Bitcoin, the real potential in the blockchain is only just starting to be unlocked.::Bitcoin may be the most famous example of a blockchain in use, but it is actually a rather unimaginative way to use it. The blockchain is finally starting to fulfil its promise as a game-changing technology, a kind of infrastructure for record-keeping. To facilitate movement of value (such as money) and changes in ownership (shares, for example), and even to manage online identities. The Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) has announced that it will use a blockchain-based system to record who owns shares of listed companies, and to keep track of transactions and settlements when people buy and sell shares. The move comes as the price of Bitcoin has risen more than US$14,000 in the past year. Yet Bitcoin does not really exploit the new databases and record-keeping infrastructure that blockchain technology makes possible. Read more: Demystifying the blockchain: a basic user guide The blockchain is also called a “public” or “distributed” ledger. Think of a spreadsheet that is publicly available to view, and simultaneously held on numerous computers. When someone transfers a Bitcoin, it is verified by the system, encrypted, and a new line (or “block”) is added to the spreadsheet. The ASX’s blockchain will replace the ASX’s CHESS (Clearing House Electronic Sub-registry System) system. Currently, the ASX requires each trade to be verified against the ASX’s centralised database of ownership records and reconciled with payments. So while trades take place in fractions of a second, the actual clearance (making sure who owns what) and settlement (the transfer of money and shares) is cumbersome, slow, expensive, and prone to human error. The ASX’s blockchain will greatly simplify this process. Instead of having to reconcile trades against a centralised database, the verification of ownership and settling of accounts can be done directly between participants (as is done with Bitcoin trades). This is much simpler, faster and more secure. Read more: What's holding up the blockchain? The fact that the ASX’s blockchain announcement made headlines around the world shows what a big leap forward this is. The ASX’s blockchain will streamline the settlement process, improving productivity and therefore reducing costs in the Australian stock market. This means that our financial markets will work better, offering an immediate benefit to Australia’s economy. Exchanges are also a global business, and the adoption of blockchain technology in Australia’s major exchange means that it has a competitive edge over other exchanges. Companies choose where to list, based on a variety of factors including the quality of the exchange technology. More business for the ASX will translate into more local jobs. One potential downside of the ASX adopting the blockchain, however, is that some workers who currently process settlements on the ASX may lose their jobs. Some financial companies that currently benefit from the slow settlement process, such as brokerage firms, will also lose out. Read more: Blockchain really only does one thing well But the ASX’s move is just scratching the surface of what blockchain technology can do to the Australian financial sector. The same argument that applies to the ASX - that the blockchain is more efficient and productive than existing record-keeping and transaction processes - can also be extended to other exchanges, such as bond markets. In other words, the ASX’s blockchain is just the beginning of a technological transformation of Australia’s financial markets. Blockchains will also make these exchanges more attractive to build services on, such as for managing wealth. This is a further benefit for consumers and the broader finance industry, not purely from lower prices also from the possibility of new products and services. Read more: The blockchain does not eliminate the need for trust But how is any of this even possible in the first place? Part of the credit must go to Australian regulators. They created the environment for this huge shift in technological practice. Australia is now leading the adoption of the blockchain, despite it being a US-built technology. It is similar to how African telecommunications companies are leading the way in mobile payments, even though Finland created modern mobile phones with companies like Nokia. Even if you’re not excited about new technology in the Australian finance industry, its global competitiveness, or even our regulatory agility, the ASX announcement is a harbinger of what adoption of blockchain technology will increasingly look like.::2017-12-11T03:34:04Z::ASX, Australian stock exchange, Bitcoin, Blockchain, Chess, provenance::Jason Potts::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/198457/original/file-20171211-27714-avdewj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C253%2C3199%2C1599&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

But in May 2022, the UST de-pegged and began a death spiral that eventually took down the entire Terra ecosystem, wiping out approximately $40 billion in market value in its wake. During its case, the SEC argued that Kwon and, under his direction, Terraform Labs deceived everyday investors about the nature of that algorithm, implying that it allowed UST to “naturally heal” and “automatically self-heal” in the event of a de-peg. But there was no self-healing or algorithmic magic that kept UST pegged to the dollar, the SEC argued. Instead, the value of UST was maintained through continuous trading activity, including large-scale trading done by institutional investors. During her closing arguments on Friday, SEC attorney Laura Meehan told the jury that during a prior de-peg in May 2021, Kwon and Terraform Labs made a “secret agreement” with Jump, a trading shop that acted as a market maker for Terraform Labs, to step in and buy millions of dollars of UST off-chain to inflate the value and bring it back to parity with the dollar. Meehan added that after Jump’s intervention, Kwon and his company intentionally kept Jump’s involvement quiet, wanting instead to use the re-pegging as evidence of the algorithm’s effectiveness. “Defendants lied for years. They lied about the success and size of their blockchain … they lied about the stability of their algorithm,” Meehan said. “They’re still parading themselves around like they’re a real company, like they’re legitimate.” As Meehan neared the end of her remarks, the Manhattan courtroom gently shook – not, as District Court Judge Jed Rakoff quipped, “with the force of the SEC’s arguments” but with the tremors of a 4.8 magnitude earthquake in neighboring New Jersey. Lawyers for Terraform Labs and Do Kwon made their closing arguments after the SEC, pausing intermittently as emergency alerts for the earthquake periodically sounded from cell phones across the courtroom. The defense, led by attorney Louis Pellegrino, told the jury that the mobile payment app Chai did, in fact, utilize the Terra blockchain for a variety of things, including refunding purchases and providing liquidity. But mostly, Pellegrino’s argument focused on the alleged “secret agreement” between Jump and Terraform Labs, and whether or not Kwon and his company had actually lied to investors about the nature of the algorithm. “The mechanism was not a computer that functioned on its own,” Pellegrino said. “It wasn’t some magical machine…and everyone knew it.” Minting-and-burning to maintain the peg had to be done by market participants, he argued, and Kwon and Terraform Labs had “never claimed” otherwise. Those market participants included companies like Jump – which Pellegrino said had a formal agreement, not a secret one, to provide liquidity to Terraform Labs when needed. “All reasonable purchasers knew about the risks,” Pellegrino argued, pointing to a trading memo from Galaxy Digital citing the inherent risk of a collapse of the ecosystem. When that collapse eventually came, Pellegrino said, it was as the result of a devastating short attack – carried out by hedge funds including Wintermute Trading, Celsius, and Jane Street – that made Terraform Labs a victim alongside its investors. “Terraform is still here, trying to make things better,” Pellegrino said. “Terraform is no house of cards.” Terraform Labs filed for bankruptcy protection in January. During his testimony earlier this week, current CEO Chris Amani testified that the company had approximately $150 million in assets remaining and that he made an annual salary of $3 million. Former CEO and defendant Do Kwon was absent from court for the duration of the trial. Kwon remains in Montenegro, where he has been since his March 2023 arrest for using fake Costa Rican travel documents en route to Dubai after months on the lam. Kwon served a prison sentence for his crime but was released on bail and placed under house arrest in the Balkan country last month. The country’s Supreme Court is currently weighing competing extradition requests from the U.S. and South Korea, Kwon’s native country, which both want to try him on criminal fraud charges in addition to civil ones. Kwon’s ultimate destination remains unclear. Read More: Do Kwon Released From Montenegrin Prison on Bail; Terraform Labs' Civil Trial Begins in NYC (coindesk.com) Edited by Jesse Hamilton.

Binance is a reliable peer-to-peer crypto exchange offering resources and tools for traders looking to buy and sell crypto between themselves. This guide demonstrates how to buy and sell USDT (or any other crypto) using Binance’s P2P trading interface. As USDT is a stablecoin, it is the nearest to any fiat currency you wish to off-ramp to in terms of steady pricing. Even for on-ramping, USDT is more like crypto cash, free of the inherent price volatility associated with other assets like Bitcoin, BNB, ETH, and more. Therefore, USDT/USD, USDT/INR, and other USDT-specific pairs are the most sought-after in the Binance P2P space. Here’s another reason why P2P platforms have garnered popularity, particularly in countries like India: “Indian Govt Collected ₹ 105 Cr in TDS on VDA transactions. In my opinion this is a pretty low number as high TDS led to most of the volumes shifting to offshore or P2P platforms. I believe this number could be at least 10-20x higher if a lower TDS rate (0.1% or 0.01%) was introduced, also serving the purpose of tracking and tracing VDA transactions.” As Gupta explains, a large chunk of crypto users shifted to P2P platforms in 2023 as direct trades between this community didn’t account for taxes. Even though purchasing USDT using P2P on Binance is relatively straightforward, there are a number of steps that can minimize headaches: Did you know? As someone looking to buy USDT on Binance P2P, you can even advertise the quantity you are willing to by along with the offered price. Sellers can use this data to filter, based on preferences. Now that the basic elements are out of the way, here are the steps to kickstart the transaction process: Unless you have already paid the sum, as a buyer, you are free to cancel the deal if you feel something is off with the seller. Sellers on Binance P2P have a more difficult task as they are the ones who receive the funds. Despite the challenges, there are several steps to follow to sell USDT easily: Note: A safe practice for sellers is to check for the buyers manually, as once matched, you, the seller, cannot cancel the order. What is a chargeback? For #Binance P2P transactions, a chargeback happens when your trade partner requests to have their funds back after you’ve completed the transaction. Swipe for tips on how to avoid them 👉 Once you are satisfied with everything, release the crypto from Binance’s escrow to the buyer’s account. Remember setting up a passkey earlier? This can help you transfer the assets in one click without having to feed in the multiple confirmation codes. However, never simply believe the screenshot. Confirm that you have received the amount in your account before releasing the crypto. Binance P2P buying and selling can also be initiated in cash via face-to-face transactions in specific regions. Still unsure about the Binance P2P framework? Refer to this detailed explainer to know more. It is natural for someone to change their mind midway through a P2P transaction. Regardless of the reasons, which are usually related to safety or price, here’s how to cancel a P2P order without any trouble. Do note that frequent cancellations can lead to negative feedback and may harm your reputation. If you do not want to sell crypto but the buyer has already made the payment, raise a dispute immediately. If a dispute arises due to cancellation, especially after the payment has been made, Binance’s dispute resolution system will intervene. It’s important to communicate clearly and provide valid reasons for cancellation in such cases. A Binance P2P merchant enjoys a host of perks. Note that not everyone can qualify. Here are the steps to become eligible: Notice how the requirements for becoming a merchant are pretty steep. If you are a frequent, high-volume trader, it is advisable to get merchant status. Also, it is worth mentioning that there are other Binance alternatives like OKX and more, which may have more lenient merchant programs. If you are looking to buy and sell crypto peer-to-peer, you might also want to consider those avenues. 🚀 Join Dustin as he shares on "How to safely use P2P". Worry no more when using P2P as Bybit has simple yet secure measures in place for all your transactions. 💫 Join now to become the Bybit Trader of the Year: https://t.co/nd5lYCVSlQ #BybitTraderof2024 #BybitVIP pic.twitter.com/3mVipMbQkg There is no shortage of competitors to Binance P2P. As outlined above, several leading global exchanges like OKX, Bybit, and more offer peer-to-peer trading services. Yet, learning the ins and outs of Binance’s peer-to-peer trading space is a smart move, considering the sheer popularity and user volume associated with the service. Note that Binance P2P trading is not just about following the steps and remembering guidelines. The trick is to continue executing trades until you are comfortable with the process and able to perfect every move while ensuring your assets remain safe and secure as you learn. Binance US doesn’t offer peer-to-peer trading services due to regulatory concerns. Currently, Binance US operates primarily as a crypto-only exchange and does not directly support fiat transactions for buying crypto. Users can deposit cryptocurrencies into their Binance US account and engage in crypto-to-crypto transactions to manage their digital assets. The Indian Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) has taken measures to block the URLs of Binance and several other crypto exchanges due to their failure to comply with India’s anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. The FIU issued formal notices to these entities, highlighting their non-compliance with mandatory record-keeping and suspicious transaction reporting as required under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). These actions are part of a wider initiative to ensure that all financial operators, including those located abroad but active in India, adhere strictly to local AML standards. Binance P2P does not charge users for buying or selling on its platform, which includes a variety of payment methods. This fee exemption makes Binance P2P an attractive option for those looking to buy crypto or sell crypto directly with others. The platform uses an escrow service to secure transactions, holding the cryptocurrency until both parties confirm the transaction, which enhances the security and reliability of Binance P2P trading. However, in countries like India, where TDS is implemented on every sell-side transaction, the platform might levy fees upfront, to be borne by the sellers. To buy crypto on Binance, you must get yourself verified, put out an advertisement if needed, or directly connect with the seller by relying on Binance’s order matching system. Binance P2P buying is a good way to on-ramp. Also, you can buy crypto like Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and more as well as USDT. Binance P2P selling lets you sell USDT or any other crypto, including Bitcoin (BTC) and some of the more popular picks for fiat. You can simply connect with the buyers automatically to sell crypto or search for the best price and buyer feedback manually before proceeding.

118::https://blockworks.co/news/we-need-to-stop-forcing-use-cases-on-blockchains::Blockworks::article::We need to stop forcing use cases on blockchains::Opinion: The idea that existing generic blockchains can later be molded for specific use cases lacks foresight.::The idea that existing generic blockchains can later be molded for specific use cases lacks foresight Midjourney modified by Blockworks Every industry is unique, with its own needs, quirks and customer demands. The Web3 industry is no exception — especially on the quirky front. The prevailing mode of action in the industry so far has been to build general-purpose blockchains in the hopes that folks will later build specific layer-2 functionalities for them. But the idea that existing generic blockchains can later be molded for specific use cases lacks foresight. We’ve made great progress with generalized blockchains like Ethereum, as the growth of DeFi and NFTs so clearly demonstrated. But that approach isn’t sustainable — scaling has been and still is one of Ethereum’s most challenging tasks. In order to correctly prepare for the future of blockchain and shape blockchains for the future, we need to stop anchoring our thinking in what already exists. Rather than maintaining established blockchains as the blueprint for specific apps and use cases, we need blockchains that are purpose-made and use case-driven. The era of generalized “smart contract platforms” is coming to a close. The space is already moving steadily in that direction. Appchain protocols like Polkadot, Cosmos and Avalanche are embracing the change in full. But even layer-2 rollups, the hottest chain narrative of the moment, are a first step towards this future of specialization. Optimism’s OP Stack is a clear contender as a framework for deploying custom EVM rollups. With time, additional capabilities beyond the EVM can be developed on rollups as well, as we’re seeing with Arbitrum’s Stylus. We’ve observed this drive towards specialization countless times: from smartphones, computers to social media and the hundreds of different SaaS platforms catering to specific niches. We need to remember that Web3, blockchain or crypto (whichever is your nickname of choice) are all-encompassing terms for an industry that is actually made up of dozens of sectors and niches. These sectors connect and collaborate (they interoperate!), forming a cohesive whole while maintaining their distinctive characteristics and use cases. Industry observers may point to many formerly successful companies as examples of how a myopic vision led to the demise of a number of former market leaders. Kodak, Blockbuster and Nokia all forfeited dominance to products that had better, more-attuned-to-consumer use cases with a clearer grasp of the future. The infrastructure for custom blockchain apps is in development, but now the burden is on app developers to start building them for their own custom uses. And this has the potential to unlock true adoption of blockchain as a means to an end — not the goal in itself. Take the example of Bitcoin. With Taproot and Ordinals, people have been trying to jerry-rig tokens and NFTs to the poor Bitcoin blockchain, which was never even close to being designed for such uses. It’s okay if Bitcoin is just a store of value and payments blockchain. Anything else would eventually be outcompeted by a blockchain specifically built for that purpose. In recent years, we’ve seen a true flourish of smart contract uses in the form of DeFi, GameFi and NFTs. Still, despite some undeniable success, all popular smart contract use cases involve some form of speculation, which becomes unreliable when market conditions are still infamously volatile (though secretly beloved). The types of future applications that will use custom blockchains will be varied, but in my view, it will be much more B2B focused than before. Many such uses are currently locked behind clunky infrastructure and expensive storage. For example, a blockchain for Big Data analytics incorporates the needs of data scientists for data warehousing, SQL, verifying outputs and much more. Imagine every industry has its own custom-built blockchain. There are already examples where this is working; IBM offers custom blockchain solutions for supply chain networks. The idea of blockchain as a sandbox for industries — from travel to IT to fintech — to build in is rapidly being adopted by some of the most established tech powerhouses. It’s time to stop thinking about how we can mold a blockchain to a certain use case, and instead think about how to build a blockchain to fit what we’re trying to build. This isn’t always simple, and it certainly isn’t easy to convince everyone of this view. To borrow a line from Steve Jobs, “a lot of times, people don’t know what they want until you show it to them.” It may not always work — using blockchain for your coffee maker startup is probably not wise — but it will help ambitious and creative founders to find meaningful reasons to use blockchain, the right way.

119::https://coinatory.com/cryptocurrency-news/paxos-to-launch-stablecoin-15029/::Coinatory::article::Paxos to Launch Dollar-Backed Stablecoin::Paxos, a cryptocurrency brokerage, has obtained preliminary regulatory approval in Singapore to offer digital payment token services, aiming to launch a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin upon receiving full approval. This move follows their initial license acquisition in Singapore for tokenization and custody services.::Paxos, a crypto brokerage, has secured a provisional license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore to provide digital payment token services, as stated in their recent announcement. This preliminary nod for the newly established Paxos Digital Singapore Pte. Ltd. enables the company to operate under the Payments Services Act (PSA) while it awaits full regulatory approval. Once fully authorized, Paxos plans to collaborate with corporate clients to launch a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin. Walter Hessert, Paxos’ Head of Strategy, highlighted the growing global demand for the U.S. dollar, noting the challenges non-U.S. consumers face in accessing dollars in a safe, reliable, and regulated manner. The firm anticipates that this new offering will attract more customers, especially with the stablecoin market projected to expand from $125 billion to $2.8 trillion over the next five years, according to estimates from brokerage firm Bernstein. This development marks a significant step for Paxos in Singapore, coming a year after the company first obtained a license to provide tokenization, custody, and trading services under the same legislation. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

120::https://cryptobriefing.com/bvnk-paypal-pyusd-integration/::Crypto Briefing::article::PayPal's stablecoin PYUSD joins BVNK's crypto payment ecosystem::The integration aims to streamline global business payments.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article BVNK, a payment infrastructure provider, has announced the integration of the PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin, issued by Paxos Trust Company, into its payment system. This move allows businesses to access PYUSD on BVNK’s platform, which supports a variety of digital and fiat currencies. In addition, as an approved member of the PYUSD ecosystem, BVNK can directly create (mint) and remove (burn) PYUSD tokens for customers, the company shared in the press release. Chris Harmse, BVNK co-founder and VP of Commercial Strategy, stated: “We’re building modern payment infrastructure to enable more businesses to operate across banks and blockchains and maximize financial flexibility. Stablecoins make up almost 90% of the payment we process, and they’re very important to our customers as a way to settle global payment efficiently. We’re thrilled to introduce PYUSD to our platform,” Harmse stated. Nick Robnett, Head of Asset Growth at Paxos, also commented on the integration, highlighting the trust and growth PYUSD brings to digital assets. “As a dollar-pegged stablecoin that is issued by Paxos Trust Company, which is overseen by New York Department of Financial Services, PYUSD is bringing greater trust to digital assets. We’re seeing growth every day as it’s rolled out across the PayPal ecosystem – and we’re delighted to team up with BVNK to give more businesses access to PYUSD, and more options for how they move their money globally,” Robnett noted. With PYUSD, BVNK customers can engage in a range of financial activities, including settling payments and creating PYUSD wallets. The integration reflects the significant role stablecoins play in the blockchain economy. As of May 16, 2024, PYUSD’s market cap reached $377 million, according to data from CoinGecko.

121::https://theconversation.com/the-bitcoin-bubble-how-we-know-it-will-burst-88511::The Conversation::article::The Bitcoin bubble – how we know it will burst::An analysis of Bitcoin’s fundamentals shows how much of a bubble its price has inflated to.::In the last year, the price of Bitcoin has increased from less than US$800 to more than US$12,000. This huge spike in value has many asking if it is a bubble or if the high price today is here to stay. Finance defines a bubble as a situation where the price of an asset diverges systematically from its fundamentals. Investment mogul Jack Bogle says there is nothing to support Bitcoin, and the head of JP MorganChase, Jamie Dimon has called it a fraud “worse than tulip bulbs”. Like any asset, Bitcoin has some fundamental value, even if only a hope value, or a value arising from scarcity. So there are reasons to hold it. But our research does show that it is experiencing a bubble right now. Together with Shaen Corbet at Dublin City University, we took as the fundamentals of Bitcoin elements of the technology that underpins it (and other cryptocurrencies). We looked at measures, which represent the key theoretical and computational components of how cyrptocurrencies are priced. New Bitcoin is created by a process of mining units called blocks. Bitcoin is built on blockchain technology – a digital ledger of transactions – which enables the currency to be traded independently from any central banking system, without risk of fake or duplicate Bitcoins being used. Instead of having a bank verify pending transactions (a “block”), miners check them and, if approved, the block is cryptographically added to the ever-expanding ledger. So the first measure we examined relates to mining difficulty. It calculates how difficult it is to find a new block relative to the past. As per the Bitcoin Protocol, the number of Bitcoin is capped at 21m (there are currently 16.7m in circulation). This means that as more people mine for Bitcoin and more blocks are created, each block is, all things being equal, worth less than the previous block. The second measure we looked at relates to the “hash rate”. This is the speed at which a computer operates when mining. To successfully mine Bitcoin, you must come up with a 64-digit hexadecimal number (called a “hash”), which is less than or equal to the target hash. The faster you can do this, the better chance you have of finding the next block and receiving payment. The third measurement was “block size”. This relates to how large the chain is at any given time, with larger chains taking longer to mine than shorter ones. And lastly we looked at the volume of transactions conducted. Any asset, in particular any currency, which is more widely used will be more valuable than one which is used less frequently. In our study, we examined data from Bitcoin’s early days – from July 2010 to November 2017. The price of one Bitcoin did not rise above US$1 until April 16, 2011, then to US$10 on June 3, 2011 and US$100 on April 2, 2013. Since then the price rise has clearly been exceptional. We then applied an accepted method that is used to detect and date stamp bubbles after they burst. In essence, this involves identifying the existence of an explosive component in a series. As the series, here the price of bitcoin, “explodes”, it runs the risk, like any explosion, of flying apart. A possibly counter-intuitive result of this approach is that if a fundamental driver and the price of an asset both show an explosive component, we might not conclude a bubble is present. A bubble is when something deviates from its fundamental value. If the fundamental value is itself growing explosively then the price would also. Think of dividends on a stock. If, somehow, these were to grow at an explosive rate we might expect to see the price do the same. While unsustainable, this is not technically a bubble. To overcome this, we then date stamp a bubble as being present when the price shows an explosive component and the underlying fundamentals do not. Here are the results of the analysis: The orange lines denote when the price is showing explosive behaviour. We also see a period where the hash rate was growing explosively – the blue columns in late 2013 and early 2014. This is also an indication of a price bubble, which went on to burst. So there are clear points where bubbles are visible – including now. The price of Bitcoin at present shows explosive behaviour in the absence of anything similar in its fundamentals. We see the price moving upwards in a manner that is not related to the technical underpinnings. It is a clear bubble. A weakness of these tests and indeed all bubble identification tests is that they take place after the bubble has burst. Even this test, which can be redone as swiftly as new data arrives, is such. Bubbles by their nature grow in a compound manner – so even a day or two delay in addressing the situation can make a bubble significantly worse. What is not yet available is an accurate advanced warning bubble indicator. In its absence, this approach may be the best. Unfortunately, we cannot use this approach to determine the extent of the bubble. There is no well-accepted model that suggests a “fair” value for Bitcoin. But whatever that level is, it is almost certain that, at present, it is well below where we are now.::2017-12-06T13:51:08Z::Bitcoin, Blockchain, Commodities, Cryptocurrency, Finance, Financial bubbles, Money, financial assets::Brian Lucey::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/197931/original/file-20171206-933-mrs2fs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C440%2C3000%2C1500&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

Cove is optimized by Gauntlet and audited by Trail of Bits, Quantstamp and yAudit." April 9: Silicon Valley venture giant Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) made news last year when it announced plans to wade into deep tech research – switching off its investor cap to become a part-time computer science researcher and builder. On Tuesday, the firm unveiled some of the first fruits of that foray with the release of an open-source code implementation for "Jolt," its zero-knowledge virtual machine (zkVM). The "zero-knowledge" (ZK) bit of Jolt refers to a form of cryptographic trickery that powers a16z's VM under the hood – allowing the virtual computer to process and verify data while adhering to special constraints around privacy and security. April 9: Waterfall Network, a smart-contracts protocol based on directed acyclic graphs (DAG) technology, announced on Tuesday the release of a new desktop app for Windows and macOS that "allows almost anyone to easily set up their own node on the blockchain," according to the team: "With one-click setup, users only need to download and open the app, their Metamask (or any EVM) wallet, and they will have a full node running in sync with Waterfall Network.

April 9: POKT Network, describing itself as the "RPC base layer," has "welcomed three new gateways" and is bringing "open data access to millions of end users," according to the team. "Developer DAO, Raid Guild and Chainstack will bring their respective networks and distribution to POKT Network, providing more developers with read/write access to 60+ blockchains’ by building on top of POKT Network’s decentralized infrastructure. The innovation of Gateways lies in the ability for businesses of every kind – centralized or decentralized – to resell access to infrastructure by leveraging a blockchain protocol as the central coordinating party." April 9: Mantle, an Ethereum layer-2 network, has launched its Mantle Scouts Program, "to kickstart the growth of innovative projects on Mantle," according to the team: "Distributing $1 million worth of MNT tokens to select builder teams, the pilot edition of Mantle Scouts Program empowers 16 respected industry leaders to bootstrap credibility, growth and unique innovations. This includes David Chreng-Messembourg, founding partner of LeadBlock Partners and LeadBlock Bitpanda Ventures; Peter Yang, managing director at Fenbushi Capital; Tascha Punyaneramitdee, founder of INIT Capital; Chris Sirise, co-founder of Pixelmon; John Park, CEO of a41, among others." April 9: The Worldcoin project announced two new updates "to provide individuals more choice and control over their data," according to the team. They include "the ability to unverify World IDs via permanent iris code deletion and in-person age verification checks at each humanness verification location. These were established in consultation with third-party data, privacy and security experts including the Bavarian State Ofﬁce for Data Protection Supervision (BayLDA), the project’s lead supervisory authority in the EU." (WLD) April 9: Komodo, a project for blockchain interoperability and atomic swap technology, launched Komodo Wallet (browser extension), "a non-custodial crypto wallet, cross-chain DEX and crypto bridge all rolled into one app," according to the team. "From the Wallet tab, browser extension users can expand to a full-screen web interface to use additional features, including a fiat on-ramp, an NFT wallet (which supports ERC1155 and ERC721 tokens) and a crypto bridge. Komodo Wallet (browser extension) allows users to create a new wallet or import an existing Komodo Wallet seed phrase. If wishing to import crypto assets from a third-party wallet, users can do so by importing the associated private key(s). For users wishing to connect a third-party wallet, Trezor is supported within the app." April 9: Monad Labs, the development firm behind layer-1 blockchain Monad, has closed a $225 million Series A led by Paradigm with additional funding by investors including Electric Capital and Greenoaks. According to the team: "Founded in 2022 by Jump Trading alums Keone Hon and James Hunsaker, along with Eunice Giarta (former MIT Media Lab, Shutterstock, Broadway Technology), Monad raised its $19 million seed round in February 2023." The layer-1 blockchain is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that executes the rules of Ethereum and makes sure submitted transactions and smart contracts follow the rules. More than 96% of the capital invested in decentralized finance (DeFi) is processed by the EVM, Monad said in a post on Substack. However, while Ethereum processes fewer than 20 transactions per second, according to etherscan.io, Monad says its testnet, which went live in March, can handle some 10,000 TPS. April 9: The DFINITY Foundation, a Swiss not-for-profit research and development organization and major contributor to the Internet Computer blockchain, announced the launch of the Olympus Acceleration Platform, describing it as "Web3’s first decentralized, on-chain global acceleration platform. Olympus supports the development and adoption of Web3 technology across multiple ecosystems. The acceleration platform is a first of its kind platform and will be used by teams around the world to organize and launch their own accelerator programs." April 9: ZkLink announced the consolidation of stablecoins on zkLink Nova, an aggregated layer-3 ZK rollup network with EVM compatibility. According to the team: "Upon execution, assets of the same value across supported L2 chains will be transacted as a single token on Nova. This achievement marks the next milestone in zkLink’s mission to resolve the liquidity fragmentation issue across L2 networks." According to a press release: "Currently, Nova has achieved asset aggregation, allowing users to deposit native assets from various L2 networks onto Nova for cross-chain asset trading. However, having the same assets from these networks shown as different tokens on Nova (i.e. USDC.arbi, USDC.Linea, etc.) can hinder users' trading experience. As such, Nova has deployed "MergeToken" smart contracts to consolidate assets of the same value from different chains on Nova into a single token (e.g. USDC.arbi, USDC.Linea merge into USDC). The first tokens to merge are stablecoins USDC, USDT, DAI; followed by wBTC and other tokens upon projects' requests. The token merge process will be managed by a prestigious governance committee of 12 prominent projects and institutions including Wintermute, Particle Network, Skynet Trading, Flowtraders, Ascensive Assets, Republic Crypto, Efficient Frontier, SIG, USDV, Layer Bank, Redstone Oracles and Manta Network. This committee will review and approve or deny the proposals to merge additional tokens into Nova's L3 infrastructure – decentralizing decision making and preventing autonomous control." April 9: XYO, an open-source platform for aggregating, verifying and organizing decentralized data from hardware nodes, is introducing "xyOS, an innovative platform set to enhance XYO's node functionality with a user-friendly interface that democratizes access to its platform, protocol, and network," according to the team: "Users can enjoy blockchain perks and a more sovereign experience, free from centralized constraints. Explore, create, exchange, and connect confidently on xyOS, where your engagements are truly your own. COIN users and XYO community members can sign up for early access slated for this April here." April 9: 0G Labs unveiled the launch of the testnet for 0G, designed to be a modular ultra-high data throughput blockchain optimized for on-chain AI, according to the team. "The network is now available for node operators, developers and the community to join and provide feedback for an upcoming mainnet launch in Q3 2024. The modular architecture enables 0G to offer a lean and performant network, unencumbered by legacy consensus algorithms, unrelated use cases sharing the same block space, as well as on-demand scaling." In late March, the project announced a $35 million fundraise. April 9: The Polkadot community has decided through an on-chain community vote to select IndyCar racer Conor Daly as Polkadot’s Brand Ambassador for the Indianapolis 500, marking the first time a major athlete’s sponsorship has been chosen by a vote using blockchain technology. April 9: Farmsent, a Web3 marketplace for farmers, has joined peaq, a layer-1 blockchain for DePIN and Machine RWAs, to decentralize global food trade, according to the team: "Farmsent links farmers directly with consumer-facing businesses around the world, skipping the centralized middlemen. The platform taps a DePIN of data-collecting devices, such as soil quality sensors, to track the quality and the provenance of the products.

To learn more on how we evaluate each piece of content, please proceed to our verification methodology page When stepping into a web3 job or any high-tech industry, it’s crucial to negotiate your salary. This ensures fair compensation when accepting a new job offer and helps set expectations for your skills and contributions. This guide offers strategies for negotiating salary expectations, ensuring you secure a compensation package that reflects your true value. These tactics will help prepare you to navigate salary discussions with confidence. Discussing your salary is pivotal, especially when transitioning into new fields like web3 jobs or moving from non-tech jobs to tech roles. These discussions also promote workplace transparency, especially in web3, where standard compensation packages are still being developed. Importantly, clear salary discussions aid in personal financial planning, which may benefit people who are transitioning careers. This issue of fair compensation also intertwines with the gender pay gap, often due to different negotiation tactics between genders. A study by the Pew Research Center indicates that most U.S. workers, except those self-employed, did not negotiate for higher pay than their last job initially offered. Nevertheless, men are slightly more likely than women to have asked for higher pay, with 32% of men versus 28% of women reporting they negotiated for more than the offer. This disparity highlights the importance of encouraging proactive salary discussions across all sectors to reduce discrepancies and ensure a more equal working environment. Securing the salary you deserve requires a well-prepared approach to negotiation. Here are a few steps to get you started: Before you even start negotiating, it’s essential to have a clear understanding of what your skills are worth in the current market. This involves researching salary ranges for web3 jobs and similar positions within your geographic area and industry. Websites like Glassdoor, PayScale, and LinkedIn Salary can provide insights into what others in your field earn. Next, a thorough self-assessment is equally important. List your skills, experiences, and accomplishments, especially those rare and in high demand. This will help you understand your market worth and enable you to articulate these during negotiations. Once you have a clear picture of the market and your worth, set a realistic salary target based on this data. Setting a range rather than a single figure is often useful, giving you flexibility and room to negotiate. When negotiating salaries, especially in web3, tailor your pitch to highlight how your unique skills and experiences align with the company’s needs and goals. Be prepared to discuss specific examples of how your contributions could benefit the organization, perhaps by mentioning similar accomplishments or demonstrating an understanding of new technologies and trends in web3. Using concrete data to demonstrate your value can be highly persuasive. For instance, if you’ve led projects that exceeded goals or significantly improved efficiencies, quantify these achievements in terms of time, money saved, or revenue generated. “When negotiating, highlight your skills and how they align with the role, and be clear about which parts of the package you are discussing, including salary, benefits, and work flexibility. Always aim for a mutually beneficial agreement and keep the door open for future discussions as you demonstrate your value.” Timing can significantly impact the outcome of your salary negotiation. Ideally, discussions about salary should come after you’ve received a job offer but before you accept it. This is when you have the most leverage, as the company has already indicated they want you but hasn’t locked down the terms of your employment. When discussing salary, avoid admitting to being underpaid. Instead, convey that you're highly sought after. Frame it so that compensation seems secondary, showcasing your market desirability. Regardless of how negotiations unfold, maintaining a professional demeanor is crucial. This not only helps preserve your current relationships within the company but also sets a positive tone that could benefit your future interactions. It’s often advantageous to ask for a slightly higher salary than your target. This gives you some room to maneuver during negotiations and can result in a higher final offer than initially anticipated. Remember, salary is just one part of your compensation package. Benefits such as health insurance, retirement contributions, flexible working conditions, and professional development opportunities can also be negotiated and add significant value to your package. Arina Kogalenok, HR Director at BeInCrypto, highlights the importance of taking an extra step in your career, be it in web3 or any tech role: “I had an employee who took the initiative to outline a set of tasks he would like to take on in addition to his current role and indicated the desired salary level for this work. This greatly facilitated my decision-making process regarding his promotion. I view this approach as highly professional and would be happy to discuss options with such an individual.” Be prepared for potential objections and have appropriate responses on standby. This might include justifications for your salary request based on your research or alternative compensation options if the employer cannot meet your salary expectations. If the salary offered is non-negotiable, consider other areas where you can agree on beneficial terms, such as a sign-on bonus, extra vacation time, or remote work days. Securing an appropriate salary requires preparation, strategic timing, and clear communication. Understanding and articulating your value can enhance your chances of securing a compensation package that reflects your worth, especially in the web3 sector. Negotiation is not just about pushing for more but about finding a mutually beneficial agreement that fosters long-term career fulfillment and growth. Researching industry standards for your role and assessing your experience and achievements can help you establish a realistic salary range. If your counteroffer significantly exceeds the initial offer, consider revising it and inquiring about future growth opportunities within the company. Negotiating rather than accepting the first offer outright is advisable, as initial offers often include some room for negotiation. Ultimately, it’s important to follow your intuition, and if you feel the need to do so, you can ask for advice from a close friend or colleague in the same industry. If the salary is fixed, you can still negotiate other aspects of your compensation, like benefits, work flexibility, or a signing bonus. However, the scope of negotiation may vary depending on the conversation’s context, so it’s crucial to gauge the discussion’s tone and flow. Even in conservative sectors, using a factual and data-driven approach to demonstrate your value can bolster your negotiation. Tailor your tactics to emphasize mutual benefits, rather than making bold demands.

124::https://blockworks.co/news/fox-authenticate-digital-media-sources::Blockworks::article::FOX Corp hopes to authenticate digital media with blockchain tech::The media conglomerate’s blockchain entity is letting news organizations prove ownership over their content.::The media conglomerate’s blockchain arm is letting news organizations prove ownership over their content rafapress/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks FOX Corporation has announced the launch of ‘Verify,’ an innovative open-source protocol developed with Polygon PoS. This new tool is designed to establish the authenticity and origin of digital content. The initiative responds to the increasing challenges presented by artificial intelligence-generated media, seeking to provide a reliable verification system across the digital landscape. An Axios report said FOX plans to use the tool to make licensing more straightforward for the training of generative AI tools trained on large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. Verify came out of FOX’s Blockchain Creative Labs, which is incorporated under the FOX-owned streaming service Tubi. Blockchain Creative Labs formerly tinkered with NFT integrations in the FOX ecosystem before this latest venture into AI applications. In a blog post accompanying the release, Tubi CEO Paul Cheesbrough said Verify was “somewhat inspired by” the AI optimism of a16z head Marc Andreessen, who wrote favorably about the potential for cryptographic signatures to prevent malicious AI content. Cheesbrough also said Verify could create a repository to iron out licensing wrinkles between news outlets and AI developers who train models using media content. Notably, The New York Times alleged copyright infringement from OpenAI in a late December lawsuit. The Times claimed that millions of its articles were used to train OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot without compensation. Verify uses digital signatures to allow publishers to put media on-chain, making it easier for everyone to trace the original source of the content. News organizations can upload articles, for instance, which are turned into NFTs through Ethereum’s ERC-6150 standard. ERC-6150s are “hierarchical” NFTs that are useful for putting things like social media on-chain. With Verify, the public can use the unique token ID of these NFTs to find out the original source of any given piece of content recorded to the protocol. This is particularly useful in a world where AI and other technologies can easily copy and disseminate information without readily apparent citation. For now, the Verify Tool’s beta interface only supports FOX-owned outlets. The company has minted over 80,000 pieces of content, Axios reported. Axios said FOX is in talks with other media outlets to begin using the tool. A source with knowledge of the matter said Verify’s code was made open source in hopes that developers would build other applications on top of the protocol. Whether or not Verify can gain meaningful adoption outside of the FOX ecosystem, it may indicate a place for blockchain in AI development. “Following generative AI’s meteoric rise in 2023, we’re going to see a more transparency-focused approach to the technology this year,” Niraj Pant, founder of crypto-adjacent AI startup Ritual, said in a direct message. Verify is built on Polygon, a decision Cheesbrough says was made because of the chain’s scaling prowess. FOX’s Verify represents the first attempt by a major media company to use blockchain for AI development. Illia Polosukhin, co-founder of NEAR Protocol, thinks potential adoption of the tool by news organizations could prove blockchain technology’s bona fides to a wider audience. “I think the biggest benefit we can see is removing some stigma from mass media around crypto,” Polosukhin said.

125::https://coinatory.com/cryptocurrency-news/ripples-ceo-criticizes-u-s-14876/::Coinatory::article::Ripple's CEO Criticizes U.S. Crypto Regulations::Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, recently voiced strong criticism against the U.S. regulatory::In a series of recent comments, Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, expressed strong disapproval of the U.S. regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, particularly criticizing SEC Chair Gary Gensler. This tension could spell trouble for investors in Ripple’s cryptocurrency, XRP. Let’s delve into Garlinghouse’s remarks and explore the latest forecasts for XRP’s value. Brad Garlinghouse was forthright in his critique of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its leader, Gary Gensler. Speaking at DC Fintech Week, he accused the SEC and Gensler of misdirecting their efforts by pursuing legal action against Ripple and engaging with figures like Sam Bankman-Fried. Garlinghouse suggested that this focus might have contributed to overlooking fraud within the broader cryptocurrency market. He also targeted the SEC over speculation that they were in talks with Grayscale about the possibility of converting the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Garlinghouse contrasted the U.S. regulatory approach with that of other countries that are more actively engaging with the crypto industry, implying that the SEC’s current strategy under Gensler’s leadership is politically detrimental. In another interview, Garlinghouse expressed frustration with the U.S. government’s unclear position on cryptocurrencies. Although Ripple has recently achieved a partial legal victory over the SEC, Garlinghouse emphasized that American banks are still reluctant to incorporate XRP, owing to the persistent regulatory uncertainties. He noted that despite the court win, the U.S. government’s stance towards cryptocurrencies remains unwelcoming. Garlinghouse specifically mentioned the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) as being opposed to cryptocurrencies, suggesting that significant involvement from U.S. banks is unlikely until there’s a shift in this attitude. Despite these criticisms and the unclear regulatory landscape, Ripple has seen some positive developments. The company has received constructive feedback from the SEC and payment processing companies. They’ve also proposed a plan to Judge Torres, seeking a 90-day period to arrange for a scheduling entry. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

Share this article Humanity Protocol, a zero-knowledge decentralized identity project, has achieved a valuation of $1 billion in a round led by Kingsway Capital, with significant contributions from Animoca Brands, Blockchain.com, and other key players, according to a press release shared by the team on Wednesday. The firm said it had secured $30 million in a seed round and will use the funds to expedite the hiring process and product development, setting the stage for the public testnet launch slated for later this year. Introduced in late February this year by the Human Institute, in collaboration with Polygon Labs and Animoca Brands, Human Protocol focuses on building a proof-of-humanity identity verification solution using palm recognition technology. The project also unveils a Proof of Humanity consensus mechanism and a non-intrusive palm scanning app, aiming to establish Self-Sovereign Identity on its zkEVM blockchain. This approach is designed to ensure sybil resistance and user privacy, enhancing trust and credibility in decentralized networks and real-world applications. Humanity Protocol has already attracted over half a million waitlist sign-ups in just a month after coming out of stealth mode, the team shared in the press release. Terence Kwok, Founder of Humanity Protocol, emphasized the need for a self-sovereign identity framework that upholds inclusivity, privacy, and decentralization. “We’re creating a decentralized identity protocol that solves verifiable uniqueness and humanity in a way that protects user privacy and self-ownership of data,” Kwok stated. Manuel Stotz, Founder at Kingsway Capital, highlighted the investment’s significance in promoting digital inclusion, especially for the world’s most disadvantaged populations. “In the world of AI, as Sybil attacks continue to plague our online experiences, we’re thrilled to support industry leaders, including Terence Kwok and Yat Siu, in building a solution that will uphold the integrity of our online interactions. With their expertise and our investment, we’re confident that this initiative will pave the way for a more secure and resilient technology world for all,” Stotz noted. Yat Siu, Co-founder and Chairman of Animoca Brands, also expressed enthusiasm for the project’s potential to secure and protect users’ digital identities. “As an advocate for true digital property rights, I’m very passionate about ensuring that users’ digital identities remain secure and protected. Traditional Proof-of-Personhood methods often come with drawbacks, whether they’re too invasive, complicated, or cumbersome,” Siu stated. With its innovative Proof of Humanity mechanism, Humanity Protocol aims to become the world’s largest decentralized open identity graph, facilitating equitable transactions and services without compromising personal information.

127::https://theconversation.com/bitcoin-isnt-a-currency-and-unless-it-becomes-one-it-could-be-worthless-88656::The Conversation::article::Bitcoin isn’t a currency – and unless it becomes one it could be worthless::If you can’t use Bitcoin to buy anything then it has no intrinsic value.::Bitcoin is in decline. Not its price, which has increased 900% this year and (at the time of writing) stands at over US$12,000 per unit, but its actual use as a currency. And this makes its rapid appreciation all the more puzzling. A few years ago, enthusiasts triumphantly shared announcements from businesses that had started accepting Bitcoin. Over the last couple of years, such announcements have become scarce. Instead, businesses that once accepted the currency have begun to drop it. The BBC contacted ten businesses in London that once advertised accepting Bitcoin. Four no longer accepted it, and two that did said they hardly ever received payments in Bitcoin. The same is even true online. The Wall Street Journal, citing a report by Morgan Stanley, recently reported that Bitcoin is now accepted by just three of the top 500 global online merchants, down from five last year. If growing adoption as a currency can’t justify Bitcoin’s rapid appreciation, what can? Many enthusiasts have started to promote the idea of Bitcoin as a store of value. In economics, this is usually defined along the lines of “an item that people can use to transfer purchasing power from the present to the future”. In simple terms, it’s somewhere safe to invest your wealth that won’t lose its worth over time. Apples can be used to barter services from a neighbour while they’re still fresh, but their purchasing power will disappear as they rot. The purchasing power can be retained into the future by exchanging the apples for money, gold, government bonds or some other store of value. Some items have attributes that make them better stores of value than others, whether we are talking about physical items or digital objects. Gold is a good store of value because it’s durable. Electronic bond certificates are also durable as long as banks’ systems don’t fail, and have the added benefit of being easier to secure than physical valuables. Money, both physical currency and digital bank money, has the advantage of being very liquid, so it’s easy to convert into a purchase when needed. Bitcoin does share many of these attributes of a good store of value. It also offers potentially high levels of financial privacy, somewhat similarly to the offshore banking system. This is an important attribute of a store of value for some people, although it also creates a lack of accountability and the potential for tax evasion. But the most important attribute of a store of value is that it’s valuable. Gold is valuable because it has many industrial and decorative uses. Its price can fluctuate because of speculation on financial markets, but it can never fall to zero. There will always be someone willing to accept gold because it’s a useful commodity. Similarly, US government bonds are ultimately valuable because they entitle the owner to a relatively secure flow of interest payments. Dollars and euros are valuable because they are widely accepted as a means of payment, and will continue to be so in the foreseeable future. In contrast, the future acceptability of the Venezuelan bolivar is in doubt, so people are desperately trying to exchange it to better stores of value. Is Bitcoin valuable? It has no industrial or decorative uses, and it doesn’t entitle the holder to receive interest. It was intended to be valuable as a currency that is accepted the world over, but that doesn’t seem to be happening. The only major value that Bitcoin has now is its exchange value. Many people are willing to pay a lot of money today to get hold of some Bitcoin. But what they are getting for their money is simply the hope that another buyer down the line will pay even more money for the coins. Once the music stops, there is no fundamental value to prevent the coins’ price from falling close to zero, save for their tenuous position as the currency of choice in the online drug trade and grey-area gambling. The idea that Bitcoin is valuable because it’s a store of value is upside down. In reality, something becomes a store of value because it’s valuable. In the 1990s, people started to trade Beanie Babies on eBay. Prices of these limited-edition plush toys rose to thousands of dollars, and by 1997 they made up 6.6% of the entire site’s transaction volume. Some people invested their life savings into Beanie Babies, fully expecting their value to be preserved and more. But eventually people came to their senses and the market bombed. Beanie Babies are useful as toys and collectables, but that doesn’t justify thousand-dollar valuations. My advice to individuals and institutions tempted by the headlines is to keep their savings away from Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and “initial coin offerings” (ICOs). I know serious blockchain developers won’t mind me saying this, because they see speculative bubbles and bursts as a distraction. For Bitcoin to truly function as a store of value, it first has to gain acceptance as a currency.::2017-12-06T11:22:50Z::Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, Currency, Financial bubbles, MIT Press::Vili Lehdonvirta::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/197837/original/file-20171205-22967-13ldzf4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
128::https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/04/04/ripple-developer-behind-xrp-ledger-enters-stablecoin-fray-vs-tether-usdc/::CoinDesk::article::Ripple, Developer Behind XRP Ledger, Enters Stablecoin Fray vs. Tether, USDC::The token will be "100% backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S. government Treasuries and other cash equivalents," according to the company.::Ripple, the enterprise-focused blockchain service and creator of the XRP Ledger, is introducing its own stablecoin pegged to the price of the U.S. dollar. "The stablecoin market is over $150 billion today and is forecasted to exceed $2.8 trillion by 2028," Ripple said in a statement shared with CoinDesk. "There’s clear demand for stablecoins that deliver trust, stability and utility." The company said the token, which it plans to release "later this year," will be "100% backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S. government Treasuries and other cash equivalents." The stablecoin will be deployed onto Ripple's institution-focused XRP Ledger along with the Ethereum blockchain to start out, and it will be based on Ethereum's ERC-20 token standard. Ripple's announcement comes as stablecoins have proven one of the most popular types of digital assets among crypto traders, free (in theory) from the price volatility witnessed in larger cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum's ether (ETH). Read more: What is a Stablecoin? "What we think is going to be our differentiator is going to be the fact that the assets are going to be in dollars, Treasuries – rock solid," Ripple CTO David Schwartz told CoinDesk in an interview. "We're not trying to juice the last couple of decimal points out of this. We're looking to conquer the market and be in it for the long term." As for why Ripple – still battling an enforcement case brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission – has decided to jump into the stablecoin game, Schwartz said that the decision, in part, came down to simple "dollars and cents." "Part of it is just opportunistic. It's a growing market," he said. "You could be a bank that pays no interest. That seems like a pretty good business opportunity." Schwartz said the new stablecoin could also help breathe some life into the XRP Ledger's decentralized finance ecosystem, which has a decentralized exchange but relatively low usage relative to other chains. According to Schwartz, transparency – historically a key point of scrutiny for stablecoin issuers – will be a key focus for Ripple as it rolls out its new token. "We're gonna have public audits on a monthly basis, hopefully by a top-tier accounting firm and will disclose more on that later," said Schwartz. "We're aiming for complete transparency. You know, we'll do whatever we need to do to address those issues." Beyond the promise of transparency, Schwartz emphasized that the potential growth of the stablecoin market – currently dominated by Tether's USDT token and Circle's USDC – serves as a disincentive for Ripple or any other stablecoin provider to act dishonestly. Coinbase, the publicly traded U.S. crypto exchange, is an investor in Circle. "In the early days of Tether, people were expecting it to blow up any day, and they felt like it was really sketchy," said Schwartz. But now, "if you're Tether, it wouldn't make sense for you to run off with people's money," said Schwartz. "Even if that was your plan, you'd wait to do it" because "the market is only growing." In Ripple's case, "we're not trying to squeeze a couple of extra pennies out – we don't need to," said Schwartz. "Our balance sheet is rock solid." The Ripple CTO said his token will be aimed primarily at enterprise customers and banking institutions, organizations for whom "those kinds of practical arguments aren't really prescient because they have to justify their decisions" to "stockholders and to regulators and so on." To satisfy the needs of this market segment, Ripple says it is using U.S. banks to hold its reserves and is taking what it terms a "compliance-first mindset." USDC is currently the market leader among compliance-oriented stablecoin consumers, but Schwartz said he doesn't see it as "a winner takes all" environment. "If we were a solid number three and the market grows 12x, that's not a failure scenario," said Schwartz. "Obviously we would like to do better than that, but that's not a failure case, that's still pretty gosh darn good." Edited by Bradley Keoun.

Buterin’s vision and technical expertise have not only brought success to the Ethereum network but also helped to shape the entire blockchain landscape. Read on to learn about Buterin and his contributions and visions for the future of Ethereum. Vitalik Buterin is the co-founder of the Ethereum network, a decentralized blockchain and development platform. Born in Kolomma, Russia, on Jan. 31, 1994, Vitalik’s family left for Canada to seek better employment opportunities. At the time they left, he was six years old. Vitalik Buterin’s skills saw him enrolled in a gifted program in the third grade at a Canadian primary school. He had distinct programming skills and an early interest in economics. Buterin demonstrated remarkable mathematical prowess. Despite his academic talents, he was distant from social events and extracurricular activities, earning him the reputation of a math prodigy. Outside academics, Buterin enjoyed playing World of Warcraft from 2007 to 2010. However, his experience with the game was altered when the game’s developer, Blizzard, nerfed his highly prized favorite character. That was when he realized flaws in centralized systems, prompting him to quit. Following high school, Buterin enrolled at the University of Waterloo, pursuing advanced courses and serving as a research assistant for Ian Goldberg, a known cryptographer. Goldberg, known for co-creating Off-the-Record Messaging and his involvement with the Tor Project, mentored Buterin during this time. In 2012, Buterin achieved further recognition by winning the bronze medal at the International Olympiad in Informatics held in Italy. Vitalik’s net worth primarily stems from his cryptocurrency holdings, which reportedly exceed $866 million at the current market value. Notably, most of his wealth is attributed to his ETH holdings. Buterin holds a substantial amount of ETH, totaling 278,426 ETH and 248 WETH ($919K). This makes him one of the largest holders of ETH, constituting approximately 0.23% of all ETH in circulation. However, determining Buterin’s exact net worth is challenging due to undisclosed non-crypto assets and potential undisclosed crypto holdings. Vitalik Buterin has achieved a lot throughout his career. In 2014, Buterin was awarded the Thiel Fellowship, a prestigious grant that allowed him to focus on developing Ethereum. The following year, Buterin’s groundbreaking work on Ethereum earned him the World Technology Award in the IT Software category. This award celebrated his contributions to technology and innovation, solidifying his reputation as a visionary within the industry. In addition, Buterin was included in Fortune magazine’s esteemed “40 under 40” list in 2016, acknowledging his leadership and impact as a young innovator. In June 2017, Vitalik Buterin met with Russian President Vladimir Putin during the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. The meeting was aimed at discussing the economic significance of Ethereum for Russia. In 2018, Buterin received further recognition for his achievements. Forbes featured him in its “30 under 30” list, highlighting his exceptional accomplishments and potential across various industries. He was also honored with an honorary doctorate from the University of Basel for his contributions to blockchain and Ethereum. Buterin’s influence in the cryptocurrency and blockchain sector was further underscored by his inclusion in Fortune’s “The Ledger 40 under 40” list. His impact also went beyond industry boundaries, as evidenced by his inclusion in Time magazine’s prestigious Time 100 list in 2021, which honored him for his contributions to technology and cryptocurrencies on a global scale. In 2018, the Ethereum community celebrated Buterin’s dedication and contributions with the Vitalik Buterin Community Award. This acknowledgment recognized his unparalleled commitment to advancing the Ethereum ecosystem and fostering its growth and development. Vitalik Buterin’s philanthropic efforts have been quite transparent. In October, Buterin clarified on his social platforms that when articles suggest that he is selling ETH, the transactions are made by charities, non-profits, or other projects to cover fees associated with his donations. He added that he has not sold any ETH for personal gains since 2018. In 2021, Buterin donated over $1 billion in crypto to various charities, including the India Covid Relief fund. The funds came from selling dog-themed meme coins he was gifted by the creators of Akita Inu (AKITA), Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogelon (ELON). Buterin established Kanro, his charitable entity, to combat pandemics, focusing on addressing the challenges posed by COVID-19. Currently, Kanro’s publicly known address holds approximately 75 million USDC stablecoins. Vitalik Buterin donated USD 1.5 billion in cryptocurrency According to Jutel this was a demonstrative gesture of the legitimacy game that encompasses crypto-speculators, blockchain humanitarians and technology solution developers. https://t.co/btR0rodtgj pic.twitter.com/bktHOqJf5u In addition to Kanro, Buterin has made donations, primarily in ether. Some recipients were 13,292 ETH to GiveWell, a charity evaluator, 1,000 ETH, and 430 billion ELON tokens to the Methuselah Foundation, which is focused on extending the human lifespan. He also donated 1050 ETH to the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, which aims at safe AI technologies. Vitalik Buterin is primarily known as the co-founder of Ethereum, the second-largest crypto by market cap. Since launching Ethereum, Vitalik has remained a central figure in its development. He is the platform’s public face, contributes to its technical direction, and advocates for its adoption. Buterin also has a background in computer science. His programming skills were instrumental in building Ethereum, and he continues to be a thought leader and advisor in blockchain technology. Apart from that, as outlined above, Vitalik has been involved in charitable contributions, particularly medical research and global health initiatives. Vitalik Buterin is important for co-founding Ethereum. Ethereum introduced smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements that have opened doors to various applications beyond just crypto. Beyond Ethereum, Buterin is a prominent figure in blockchain and crypto. His technical knowledge and vision for the future of the technology are widely respected. At 30, Buterin has become a significant figure in the crypto industry, often compared to Satoshi Nakamoto in significance. His contributions have solidified his position as a key player in shaping the future of the crypto space. In 2011, seeking a new direction, Buterin stumbled upon Bitcoin. Initially skeptical due to its lack of physical backing, he gradually became intrigued as he looked deeper into its workings and potential. Desiring to participate actively in this sector, Buterin looked to acquire Bitcoin but lacked the resources to mine or purchase them outright. Instead, he turned to online forums, where he began writing articles for a blog, earning approximately 5 BTC per piece. ➫ Vitalik Buterin created $ETH at 19, and now his net worth is over $1.2B, making him the youngest crypto billionaire according to Forbes He is one of the most influential people in crypto, so knowing his views can help predict the future I've watched ~100 hours of his… pic.twitter.com/cPDw6W8JwE Buterin explored crypto’s economic, technological, and political dimensions. His writings caught the attention of Mihai Alisie, a fellow Bitcoin enthusiast based in Romania. This led to the creation of the Bitcoin Magazine, which Buterin co-founded in late 2011. Juggling writing, travel, and crypto work for over 30 hours weekly, Buterin decided to leave university. Buterin traveled the world researching various altcoins. He deduced that existing projects were too narrowly focused and lacked versatility. Buterin believed that a successful blockchain should have more applications and more adaptability. He recognized the potential for generalizing the protocols already in place and used Turing-complete programming languages to develop the idea of Ethereum. Despite initial rejections from existing projects, he created the network and wrote the Ethereum whitepaper. In early 2014, Buterin collaborated with a group of visionaries, including Gavin Wood, Anthony Di Iorio, Charles Hoskinson, and Joseph Lubin, to establish Ethereum. Together, they initiated an initial coin offering (ICO) campaign to finance the platform’s development, offering ETH coins in exchange for contributions. The campaign exceeded expectations, raising over $18 million in Bitcoin. With the funding, Ethereum began developing the platform, focusing on enabling smart contracts and decentralized applications. Ethereum introduced Solidity, a new programming language for writing smart contracts. In July 2015, Ethereum launched the Frontier network, its initial implementation. Since then, the ETH ecosystem has undergone multiple upgrades, including the Metropolis, Constantinople, Istanbul hard forks, and the Ethereum Merge, enhancing its capabilities and scalability. Vitalik Buterin has encountered several technical challenges throughout Ethereum’s development. Ethereum is a complex, secure, and scalable platform that has had technical challenges. Some of these that Buterin has addressed are ensuring smart contract security, achieving scalability in handling high transaction volumes, and balancing decentralization with efficiency. Since everything on a public blockchain is transparent, user privacy has also been a major point of discussion. Balancing the need for transparency with the desire for anonymity has been an ongoing effort. The Ethereum blockchain developed use cases such as decentralized applications (DApps) and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). However, it faced a significant setback with the launch of the DAO in April 2016. Intended to revolutionize crowdfunding, the DAO quickly raised around $150 million in ETH. However, vulnerabilities in its codebase led to an exploit, resulting in the theft of 3.6 million ETH, roughly $50 million at the time. In response, Vitalik Buterin decided to fork the Ethereum network to stop the hack and restore the stolen funds. The inability to reconcile these differences led to the Ethereum blockchain splitting into two separate chains: Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). Ethereum moved forward with the fork to recover the stolen funds, while Ethereum Classic remained on the original blockchain. ETH became more popular over time and attracted the support of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, which had over 200 members, including JP Morgan and Citigroup. Vitalik Buterin recognized that Ethereum’s proof-of-work (PoW) version led to soaring Ethereum gas fees, making transactions too expensive for many users. This delay prompted Buterin to acknowledge that Ethereum’s transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism would take six years instead of the projected one. To address the need for improved transaction throughput and congestion management, Ethereum adopted sharding as part of the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade (Merge). Sharding divides the network into shard chains, distributing the load and aiming to boost transaction throughput and relieve congestion. The Merge integrated Ethereum’s original mainnet with its new proof-of-stake Beacon Chain. This transition eliminated energy-intensive mining and enabled the network to be secured through staked ETH. However, Buterin and his team’s adoption of a more centralized approach has departed from the decentralized strategy previously favored by Ethereum community members. In addition, holders’ expectations have shifted, viewing ETH as an investment asset rather than a decentralized currency. Did you know? The name Ethereum was inspired by a medieval theory about an invisible, all-pervasive substance called “ether.” In a student testimonial at Abelard School, Vitalik Buterin reiterated his experience working on Ethereum and in the crypto industry in general: “I am truly grateful to have the opportunity to work in such an interesting and interdisciplinary area of industry, where I have the chance to interact with cryptographers, mathematicians, and economists prominent in their fields to help build software and tools that already affect tens of thousands of people around the world and to work on advanced problems in computer science, economics, and philosophy every week.” Buterin’s involvement in blockchain projects beyond Ethereum, like L4 and Plasma Group, signals his interest in contributing to the emerging metaverse. In a July 2022 post on X, Buterin criticized Meta Platform’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, suggesting corporate attempts to create the metaverse might fail. Buterin believes it’s too early to define the metaverse and that any current attempts may misfire. Given Ethereum’s role as the foundation for various developments such as DeFi, NFTs, and stablecoins, it’s unsurprising that Buterin expects the network to lead in the metaverse space. The "metaverse" is going to happen but I don't think any of the existing corporate attempts to intentionally create the metaverse are going anywhere. https://t.co/tVUfq4CWmP Buterin also sees the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) ecosystem as providing web3 usernames for crypto addresses and decentralized websites and enabling cross-platform identities for users and items. He believes ENS offers solutions that many people overlook. Buterin is fascinated by Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs), a cryptographic proof allowing a party to prove possession of specific information without revealing it. This eliminates the need for interaction between the prover and verifier. Buterin predicts zk-SNARKs will become the most widely used privacy-preserving technology in the next three decades. He calls it a potential revolution as it becomes mainstream in the next 10-20 years. Buterin has outlined future plans for Ethereum, such as implementing sharding for scalability (the Surge), introducing Verkle trees for efficiency (the Verge), reducing storage requirements (the Purge), and enhancing quantum resistance (the Splurge). Ethereum operates as a decentralized blockchain platform built by developers worldwide. No single entity controls it. While the Ethereum Foundation was important in creating the initial infrastructure and continues to support development, control over the network has shifted to the larger Ethereum community. Ethereum’s decentralized governance model ensures that no single entity or individual can unilaterally change the platform, including the Ethereum Foundation or Vitalik Buterin. Instead, decisions are made collectively by the community, which includes developers, node operators, and ETH holders. The network’s success relies on the participation of the community members. They perform activities such as staking and securing the network through node operations and ETH holdings. With hundreds of thousands of developers contributing to the platform’s ongoing development, Ethereum remains a decentralized and collaborative ecosystem. Ethereum Improvement Proposals, or EIPs, allow the community to propose improvements to the network. Any crypto community member can submit EIPs via GitHub. Once proposed, they undergo discussion and review by the Ethereum community, including editors, for approval. In addition, forum members and Ethereum enthusiasts engage in discussions, providing feedback to the proposal’s author. EIPs can cover various aspects of the Ethereum network. An example of is changes to the ERC-20 technical standard, which governs Ethereum transactions. Vitalik Buterin has played a significant role in Ethereum’s development and evolution. As co-founder and leader, he has spearheaded updates such as Ethereum 2.0, which transitioned the network to proof-of-stake and propelled Ethereum to the forefront of the blockchain revolution. Beyond Ethereum contributions, Buterin’s commitment to innovation has been a driver in transforming the blockchain space.  Vitalik Buterin’s inspiration for Ethereum started when the developer changed his character in World of Warcraft, highlighting the downsides of centralized control. In addition, while impressed with Bitcoin and other projects in the crypto industry, he envisioned a platform that would be adaptable and have more applications.Hence, Ethereum was created as a blockchain that facilitates the creation of decentralized applications (DApps) using smart contracts, among other use cases. Vitalik Buterin introduced Ethereum, which opened doors for decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other applications beyond digital currencies. Vitalik’s ongoing research, writing, and public speaking have also shaped the conversation around blockchain technology. Vitalik Buterin’s awards include recognition for his technical contributions (Thiel Fellowship, World Technology Award), leadership in the tech industry (Fortune 40 under 40, Forbes 30 under 30), and influence within the blockchain space (Honorary Doctorate, Fortune the ledger 40 under 40, Vitalik Buterin Community Award). Time Magazine even recognized him for his global impact on technology and cryptocurrency. Vitalik remains a prominent figure in Ethereum’s development. He is key in shaping its roadmap and proposing solutions for technical challenges like scalability and privacy. His ideas and research papers on scalability solutions (sharding) and Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanisms influence conversations around the blockchain space. Vitalik Buterin’s future vision for Ethereum includes implementing sharding for scalability (the Surge), introducing Verkle trees for efficiency (the Verge), reducing storage requirements (the Purge), and enhancing quantum resistance (the Splurge). Vitalik Buterin is most famous for co-founding Ethereum, a leading blockchain platform that introduced smart contracts. He is also recognized for his philanthropy and advocacy for decentralization in the blockchain space. In May 2024, Vitalik’s net worth is estimated to be around $866 million at the current market value. The majority of this is from his Ethereum collection. While the information on Vitalik Buterin’s IQ has never been released officially, several sources cite 257. Notably, an IQ level above 130 is considered high. Hence, Buterin’s IQ, which is almost twice that, is very high. Ethereum’s top holders are mostly crypto exchanges, including Binance with 7.2 million ETH and Huobi with 3.3 million ETH. Other major holders include the Ethereum Foundation, with 2.9 million ETH. Meanwhile, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is one of the largest individual holders, with 278K ETH. Vitalik Buterin is widely recognized as the Ethereum co-founder, with others like Gavin Wood, Anthony Di Iorio, Charles Hoskinson, and Joseph Lubin playing major roles in the project’s early development. Vitalik Buterin reportedly has 278,524 ETH (~$1M) and 256 WETH ($919K), making him one of the largest ETH holders. In May 2024, Vitalik’s net worth is estimated to be around $866 million at the current market value.

130::https://blockworks.co/news/crypto-blockchain-not-synonymous::Blockworks::article::Crypto and blockchain are not synonymous::Opinion: In other words, one should not judge the merits of an entire technology based on how much BONK they lost.::In other words, one should not judge the merits of an entire technology based on how much BONK they lost Artwork by Crystal Le Crypto — like any speculative asset — experienced its fair share of volatility this year. After plummeting to lows of $16,000 following the collapse of FTX in November 2022, bitcoin surpassed $43,000 in December 2023 as part of a rally that some say is just beginning. But my hope is that crypto’s persistent reputation for volatility doesn’t tarnish the perceived value of blockchain’s underlying technology. As we go into 2024, I’m optimistic that the inherent capabilities of distributed ledger technology will extend beyond mere market action. Assessing blockchain’s worth solely through the lens of profit performance overlooks the broader utility and transformative potential of Web3. In other words, one should not judge the merits of an entire technology based on how much BONK they lost. In September, blockchain data company Chainalysis released its 2023 Global Adoption Index. The purpose of this report was to recognize “leaders of grassroots crypto adoption,” and to identify the countries where average, everyday people are putting the greatest share of their wealth into cryptocurrency. The results were promising. Of the 20 countries listed, many belong to emerging market economies transitioning from lower incomes and rates of development toward rapid expansion of trade and investment flows. Personally, I’d like to believe that the growing adoption of digital currencies reinforces the technology that underlies it. What’s all the hype about? You lean into it. You go from having a MetaMask wallet and visiting a Bitcoin ATM to reading a few articles and understanding the properties of blockchain that afford secure, public transactions of data and information. You learn about Satoshi’s motivations behind digital assets not as a way to make the rich richer, but to disrupt power-hungry institutions standing in the way of autonomy and democratic financial access. Yes, blockchain is typically associated with its range of financial use cases. But the decentralized, permissionless and non-sovereign technology has, at its core, a social and reformist potential. My hypothesis is that greater grassroots adoption and understanding of crypto assets generates room for uses that capitalize on blockchain to effect change beyond the strictly financial realm. In looking beyond bitcoin rallies and new exchange offerings, other dynamic applications of blockchain come to life. Chainalysis’ 2023 index signals the presence of audiences keen to engage and capture the broader social value that blockchain offers — highlighting Web3 projects that are exceeding blockchain’s financial boundaries to drive cultural and socioeconomic transformations around the world. Nigeria: Akowe, meaning “clerk” in Yoruba, is a one-man Lagos-based startup using blockchain to issue and verify academic records. Almost all certificates issued by Nigerian tertiary institutions are physical hard copies. Coupled with high unemployment rates, certificate forgeries have become increasingly commonplace. Employers and HR firms bear the brunt of high verification costs needed to ensure the credibility of academic records, resulting in verification processes taking anywhere between two weeks to six months. Akowe’s mission is to introduce digital certificates to educators and Nigerian learning institutions, using blockchain to facilitate a tamper-proof and easily verifiable system of digital academic records. While Akowe previously operated using permissioned blockchain Hyperledger, Agboola is now exploring Amazon’s new ledger database solution QLDB, which allows organizations to create centrally managed records. The startup has piloted its project with two institutions and is actively engaged in discussions with 15 other universities, indicating a growing interest in the blockchain-based verification solution to reduce complexities within the current education sector. India: Web3 middleware SaaS start-up Airchains is partnering with West Bengal’s New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) to digitize land ownership using NFTs. The presumption of land ownership in India is complicated by different jurisdictional processes. Conflicting title investigations and lost paperwork creates glaring inconsistencies in the maintenance of land records, impeding the Indian real estate market and often making land the subject of long and tedious litigation. Airchains uses blockchain to develop unique NFTs that serve as land ownership proofs under NKDA’s jurisdiction. This system allows property registration certificates and land records to be digitally recorded and traced, eliminating tedious paperwork and promising to facilitate the lifetime tracking of ownership. Physical copies of NFTs are available in card format, while digital QR code certificates are used to ensure quick access after relevant authentication processes. Digitizing proof of land records in this way is also crucial to counteract ownership often made on the basis of customary claims. Airchains’ agenda is testament to the blockchain revolution to “steadily penetrat[e] and disrupt a plethora of traditional sectors.” Crucially, the project remains uninvolved with crypto transactions, choosing easier, gasless methods to interact with users. Airchains’ user base has soared by 150% in the past two quarters, alluding to a widespread consensus about replacing traditional bureaucracy with a transparent and secure digital system of land ownership. The team plans to introduce 500,000 NFTs deployed on Polygon Supernets to expand the land mutation process across 27,000 acres, as reported by Forbes. These examples illustrate why blockchain and crypto cannot be conflated — and why people shouldn’t be quick to point to market volatility as a reason to dismiss both. Once you distinguish a technology from its dominant applications, its uses quickly multiply. Blockchain is a new frontier in the world of finance, sure. But it is irresponsible and inaccurate to correlate an asset’s volatility to its legitimacy, especially as bitcoin’s price now exceeds $40,000 and promises to continue being influenced by market dynamics, investor sentiments and new regulation. The path to Web3 mass adoption will be long and tedious. But keeping crypto in the spotlight distracts from blockchain’s most disruptive use cases, most of which haven’t even been dreamt up yet. It is the responsibility of advocates to explore how we can co-opt this technology to transform the long-standing institutional idea of “that’s just how things have been done” because we got too complacent to challenge it.

132::https://cryptobriefing.com/layerzero-sybil-self-report/::Crypto Briefing::article::LayerZero CEO confirms 100,000 wallets self-report Sybil activity::The project's co-founder calls the fight against the Sybil attack an "eternal battle of good vs evil."::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Bryan Pellegrino, CEO of LayerZero Labs, announced that up to 100,000 wallets self-reported their Sybil behavior. According to Pellegrino, this data collection will be considerably valuable in identifying participants using similar methods and software for fraudulent activities in the future. “My intuition is that a confirmed data set of 100,000+ is going to be extremely powerful in finding others either using same software or similar methodologies. Can’t wait to see what it yields,” he stated, adding that those who haven’t self-reported should disclose their activity. The update comes after the project said it would give Sybil airdrop farmers a chance to self-report by May 17. According to the team, users who voluntarily disclose their Sybil activity will get 15% of the initial airdrop tokens. However, those who fail to self-report and are later identified will be excluded from token allocation. In addition, LayerZero has entered into strategic partnerships with Nansen, a leading analytics firm, and Chaos Labs, a prominent security company. The goal is to analyze transactions across LayerZero applications and prioritize the support of developers and committed users. The comprehensive report on Sybil detection is expected to be released after the self-reporting deadline. While self-reporting has reached a large scale, some users remain skeptical. A user named Moriarty has openly doubted LayerZero’s detection capabilities, taunting the company and urging Pellegrino to find his 25,000 hidden Sybil wallets. Pellegrino said it was a war between good and evil and told Moriarty to wait for the final results. He previously noted that only 400,000 to 600,000 out of 6 million user accounts were real.

133::https://theconversation.com/how-can-criminals-manipulate-cryptocurrency-markets-97294::The Conversation::article::How can criminals manipulate cryptocurrency markets?::Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are susceptible to fraud and price manipulation, just like any other type of investment.::Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are based on systems that are supposed to be inherently protected from fraud. Yet the U.S. Department of Justice has opened a criminal investigation into manipulation of bitcoin prices. How is that sort of activity even possible? From researching blockchain and cryptocurrencies for the past three years, I know that blockchain systems have some immutable security features. For instance, if I sent you some amount of bitcoin, and that transaction were recorded in the blockchain ledger, I couldn’t force the system to give that money back. The technology itself prevents the transaction from being reversed. But that is only true if transactions happen within the system. And there are other elements of cryptocurrency technologies that actually make fraud easier. Some of the problems the Justice Department is investigating appear to have arisen because bitcoin enthusiasts are not treating cryptocurrencies as a means of payment like dollars. Rather, they’re behaving as if bitcoins and their ilk are speculative assets like stocks and bonds. So they’re placing orders to buy bitcoin in advance, only later completing the deal. One type of fraud investigators are looking into is called “spoofing,” in which people place orders but cancel them before the deal is finalized – often without even having to pay a service fee. That makes it look like there’s more demand for bitcoin than there actually is, driving up the value of each bitcoin. That sort of manipulation is possible with almost any type of asset. Bitcoin is more susceptible than stocks or bonds because so few people hold large amounts of bitcoin. The largest 1,000 bitcoin accounts hold 40 percent of all the bitcoins in existence – with almost 20 percent held in just 100 accounts. Many of the people who own large amounts of bitcoin have been in the cryptocurrency community for a number of years and know each other. They can take coordinated actions to increase or decrease prices – and because there’s no real regulation of cryptocurrency markets, it might not even be illegal for them to do so. There are fewer protections for cryptocurrency trading, in part because it’s so new. For instance, a high volatility in stock prices would trigger “circuit breakers” in the U.S., halting trading and resetting prices to limit investors’ losses. Cryptocurrency markets have no such built-in mechanisms. Another type of fraud the Justice Department is investigating is called “wash trading,” in which one person sets up what looks like a legitimate purchase-and-sale deal, but actually does the deal with himself or herself. That makes it look like there is more activity in the market than there actually is, artificially increasing demand and value. Anyone can have as many cryptocurrency accounts as they wish to set up. And many blockchain-based systems keep users’ identities anonymous. The transactions themselves – if they actually happen – are recorded and publicly viewable, but the accounts involved are only identified with bitcoin addresses, which are long alphanumeric codes like “1ExAmpLe0FaBiTco1NADr3sSV5tsGaMF6hd.” That anonymity can make it very hard to prove that wash trading is happening and challenges law enforcement to identify and catch fraudsters. At a June 2017 congressional hearing a former federal prosecutor told of cryptocurrency investigations revealing an account set up by a person claiming to be “Mickey Mouse” living at “123 Main Street.” Some countries are starting to regulate cryptocurrency markets, either under existing regulations or new ones. In 2015, for instance, a federal investigation found that the U.S. cryptocurrency company Ripple Labs had not properly followed anti-money laundering laws and rules about getting accurate customer identification information. In May 2018, 40 jurisdictions including U.S. states, Canadian provinces and national regulators in both countries launched a formal probe dubbed “Operation Cryptosweep,” to crack down on fraudulent cryptocurrency trading. They opened as many as 70 investigations and warned roughly 35 companies about potentially violating securities laws. The vast majority of cryptocurrency trading, however, happens in countries with few regulations and lax enforcement. For instance, from early 2014 to early 2017, about 90 percent of global bitcoin trading happened through Chinese cryptocurrency exchanges. At least some of those businesses allegedly falsely inflated trading volumes to attract new customers. China has since banned online cryptocurrency trading, but people are finding loopholes. The problems will likely shift to other countries that lack strong rules, which highlights the importance of international cooperation in investigations. Cryptocurrencies are a global phenomenon; the world’s nations – especially those with lots of trading activity – will have to work together to protect consumers.::2018-05-31T10:44:24Z::Cryptocurrency::Nir Kshetri::Home::https://images.theconversation.com/files/221027/original/file-20180530-120514-16z31os.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C527%2C5501%2C2750&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
134::https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/04/05/ethereum-foundation-researchers-proposal-to-slow-eth-issuance-draws-pushback/::CoinDesk::article::Ethereum Foundation Researchers' Proposal to Slow ETH Issuance Draws Pushback::The proposal, introduced in February, could harden Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), as a form of money – by reducing the inflation of new supply. But some members of the community say if it's not broke, don't fix it. Reduction in ETH staking yield What is the role of the Ethereum Foundation?::Earlier this year, a pair of Ethereum Foundation (EF) researchers put forth a proposal to reduce the pace of new issuance of ether (ETH) tokens. It was part of a concerted plan to reduce incentives for new stakers – the investors who lock cryptocurrency into the blockchain as a way of helping to secure the network. The freshly minted ETH is a crucial component of the rewards these investors hope to receive, in the form of staking yields. As the researchers' thinking went, there's already enough stakers to provide effective security for the blockchain, and in fact any additional increases in the level of participation could enable the unwanted dominance of fast-growing third-party staking platforms like Lido. A side benefit of the proposed changes would be to harden ether as a form of money, since the total supply of the cryptocurrency wouldn't grow as quickly – effectively tapering ether's inflation rate. Now, though, some members of the community are pushing back, questioning whether there's really a need to change the tokenomics of ether and, in the extreme, whether the Ethereum Foundation plays an outsize role in influencing code upgrades on the decentralized network. The proposal was initially introduced in February by Ansgar Dietrichs and Caspar Schwarz-Schilling, both researchers at the EF. It suggests setting the blockchain's parameters so that the annual issuance of new ETH would not exceed 0.4% – a step change lower than the current effective limit of 1.5%. The big idea is that top Ethereum researchers are satisfied with the number of stakers already working to secure the network, so it might make sense to reduce the incentives for newcomers. The change would also avoid extra dilution for ETH investors. The current issuance rate "dilutes ETH holders beyond what is necessary for security," the researchers wrote. They estimated that the proposal would reduce ETH staking yields by nearly a third. Some members of the Ethereum community argue that the proposal is being rushed ahead without enough time for outside feedback. Viktor Bunin, a protocol specialist at Coinbase Cloud, wrote on the social-media platform X, “If it's not broke don't fix it.” ETH staking is the main way the Ethereum network stays secure: Ethereum's "proof-of-stake" consensus model lets users deposit ("stake") ETH with the network in exchange for yield, and to help run the chain. The substance of Dietrichs and Schwarz-Schilling's concern is that too many ETH tokens are getting staked with the network via third-party liquid staking services like Lido – crypto protocols that stake on behalf of users, and then issue derivative assets called "liquid staking tokens" (LSTs) representing their users' underlying deposits. The EF researchers say they're concerned that LSTs like Lido's stETH token – the most-traded asset on Ethereum other than the ETH token itself – could eventually replace the blockchain’s native currency as the network's de facto money, making the entire system less secure. Ethereum's security model needs ETH to be valuable in order to work, and a chief concern driving the new proposal is that if the cryptocurrency were to fall behind LSTs, it could go down in price relative to other assets. Mike Neuder, another researcher at the EF, expanded on the initial proposal by explaining that, as “real yield from staking goes to zero," stakers will need to "rely on exogenous rewards for profitability.” Reducing the ETH issuance rate could enhance Ethereum's economic model by making ETH scarcer, potentially increasing its value. Some community members, however, are pushing back on the argument that changing the tokenomics of the blockchain will improve Ethereum’s economic model. Jon Charbonneau, co-founder at crypto investment firm DBA, wrote on X that “these tweaks try to solve an unsolvable problem of fundamental tradeoffs in PoS.” PoS stands for "proof-of-stake," which is the core process or "consensus mechanism" used to secure the blockchain. Paul Dylan-Ennis, a lecturer and assistant professor at the University College Dublin School of Business, wrote that “it seems to me it's not really issuance that is at stake, so much as people have a sense that EF-associated devs and researchers appear to have an outsized power.” He added that “they are not engaging in the appropriate level of 'rough consensus' from the wider set of stakeholders.” The skepticism elicted responses from key figures within the Ethereum ecosystem, and at the Ethereum Foundation specifically. Notably, Vitalik Buterin, the influential co-founder of the Ethereum blockchain, is one of three members of the executive board of the Ethereum Foundation, according to its website. The organization is described as a "non-profit that supports the Ethereum ecosystem," and part of a "larger community of organizations and individuals that fund protocol development, grow the ecosystem and advocate for Ethereum." Tim Beiko, protocol support lead at the foundation, pushed back on Dylan-Ennis’ commentary, arguing that “it's pretty empirically untrue that 'core devs' or 'the EF' are uncontested re: governance. this current conversation is a clear example.” "Core devs" is shorthand for the broader, group of developers – drawn from multiple companies and organizations, as well as individuals – who participate in regular discussions over the network's rules, code, upgrades and strategy roadmap. Beiko added that: “I think core devs + researchers generally treat ethresearch+ethmag as a place to post WIP ideas/proposals, whereas the broader community tends to perceive it as a place where the Official Roadmap gets shared after it's ~final.” Dietrichs, the co-author of the initial proposal, responded that the "intention was purely to propose this change for consideration to the community." “Of course any change to such a sensitive part of the protocol requires broad community buy-in," Dietrichs wrote. "We tried to be clear about that from the beginning, but could certainly have done a better job.” Read more: Ethereum Finalizes 'Dencun' Upgrade, in Landmark Move to Reduce Data Fees Disclosure Please note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.

Binance P2P is an example of this — the platform has become a risky terrain for many P2P traders. Binance P2P scams are on the rise, with even the most experienced peer-to-peer professionals succumbing to fraudsters’ traps every so often. This guide covers every type of Binance P2P scam in detail, with real examples and concrete and foolproof steps to navigate them. Here’s how to stay safe on Binance P2P. Scams are rife in decentralized ecosystems, and the Binance P2P trading platform is not immune to such threats. The platform is designed for like-minded individuals to buy and sell Bitcoin (BTC), USDT, and other popular crypto assets directly among themselves. The centralized exchange (CEX) only acts as a facilitator; it doesn’t charge overheads and offers a simple and intuitive process for buyers and sellers alike. However, the space also plays host to a number of unscrupulous actors. In 2024, the platform is rife with individuals looking to dupe unwitting users who aim only to engage in legitimate P2P trading. An example of a suspicious request on Binance P2P: Here is a quick example of how a Binance P2P transaction is supposed to work: Throughout this guide, you will continue to encounter the A-B example to demonstrate the breadth and common themes of Binance P2P scams. If you use P2P – Please watch this video. In this video, we have discussed the Crypto Scam problem thats happening in India. Which is leading to Police enquiry & Bank Account Block. We have also discussed – The best available option to get the Bank account unblocked.… It is a common observation that most Binance P2P scams occur in developing nations. Here’s why: Here are some common Binance P2P scams you should be aware of. Scenario: A (Seller) lists an offer to sell 1 BTC for $50,000. B (Buyer) agrees to the trade and claims to have made the payment but never actually transfers the $50,000. A, believing the payment has been made, releases the BTC from the escrow service, only to realize later that the payment was never received. Actual example: In July 2023, two individuals were arrested in Ujjain, India, for running such a scam. They used counterfeit IDs and personal data to create fraudulent accounts on Binance P2P. The scammers sent fake SMS messages to sellers, mimicking bank notifications that falsely indicated the payment had been made. The unsuspecting sellers, believing the SMS notifications, release their Bitcoin (BTC) or other cryptocurrency without actually receiving the funds. The fraudsters exploited free SMS platforms to send these false messages, which resulted in significant financial losses for the victims. Beware of the consequences of crypto P2P scams: if your bank account freezes due to fraudulent activity, neither cybercrime support nor the bank will provide assistance, leaving your funds at risk. Even if you’re diligently paying crypto taxes, you’re on your own. Stay… Scenario: B (Buyer) completes the payment and receives 1 BTC from A (Seller). Later, B initiates a chargeback with the bank, reversing the $50,000 payment. A loses both the BTC and the payment. Did you know? In one reported case in Nigeria, a trader sold BTC worth approximately $5,000. The buyer made the payment using a bank transfer, and the seller, after confirming the receipt of funds, released the BTC. However, the buyer later initiated a chargeback, claiming the transaction was unauthorized. The bank reversed the transfer, and the seller lost both the BTC and the $5,000. It is not just about A and B anymore. Identity theft presents another scenario: Scenario: C (Scammer) uses a stolen identity to create a fake account and poses as either A (Seller) or B (Buyer). If C poses as A, they might disappear after B makes the payment. If C poses as B, they might scam A using fraudulent payment methods. The case of identity theft is growing in countries like India, where individuals who require funds may voluntarily sell their account info to scammers, usually Buyers, who then buy crypto from regular sellers and transfer funds. When they disappear, the person “C,” who didn’t get anything despite the promises, lodges an official complaint, and the fund tracking takes the authorities to the seller’s account. This then gets frozen, or the amount received is locked as a bank lien. A big update on crypto🇮🇳 in P2p scams: Cyber Criminal transferred money in victim account. Bank feezed victim bank account on police request. Victim cant access the account. Kerala High court to Banks: "Don't freeze the bank account only withhold disputed amount." Though not directly related to Binance, here is a real-life example of how identity theft goes down: Bryan Alan Sparks and Autumn Gail Luna used stolen identities to apply for various COVID-19 relief benefits and open bank accounts. Between March 2020 and January 2021, they used the identities of more than 50 individuals to claim approximately $1.98 million in benefits, including unemployment aid and small business loans. “In each case, scammers use common tactics. They pretend to be a trusted source, like a store or a bank. “ Scenario: B could be using illicit funds to buy BTC from A, using a P2P platform to clean the money. The idea here is simple. Scammers who have duped others try to purchase cryptocurrency from unwitting sellers, dumping the illegally procured funds in their accounts. If and when an investigation starts, it is the seller who faces the heat. In November 2023, Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) pled guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and failing to implement effective AML controls. This failure allowed money laundering activities to flourish on the platform. The Department of Justice (DOJ) found that Binance’s inadequate compliance measures facilitated illegal transactions, including those involving terrorist financing, cybercriminals, and other illicit actors. To use Binance P2P platforms safely, you should consistently follow a set of practices. This section outlines the requisite steps P2P traders must take to protect themselves. Here is a detailed thread that can help: Developing countries are seeing a rise in crypto P2P scams. This includes account-selling, SMS, and email scams. As a user, staying informed about these threats is crucial.

If it’s already too late for protective measures, both sellers and buyers can consider legal recourse. However, while this is technically an option, it’s often a difficult path to travel. Blockchain and FinTech lawyer Pawan Laddha spoke with BeInCrypto about the practicality of utilizing legal help, particularly in countries where many aren’t aware of P2P fundamentals. “Driving the legal system for redressal in crypto P2P scam cases is an uphill battle. The lack of clear regulations and complexity of the fundamentals of peer-to-peer transactions, decentralized ledgers, and the pseudonymous nature of crypto wallets among law enforcement officials makes it incredibly challenging to seek justice. The legal status of cryptocurrencies themselves remains a gray area, with no single comprehensive legislation governing their use. Many victims find themselves trapped in a maze of account freezes and bureaucratic tangles as authorities grapple with concepts like irreversible transactions, self-custodial wallets, and the cross-border nature of blockchain networks. Unfortunately, success stories of individuals emerging victorious from such ordeals are few and far between in the current regulatory landscape.” In most cases, Binance doesn’t guarantee refunds. However, the peer-to-peer crypto exchange does work closely with law enforcement to handle scams and frauds. Also, if the scam has been initiated (willingly or unwillingly) by a Binance P2P merchant, refunds can be a potential solution. Each merchant needs to deposit at least 2000 USDT with Binance or have this amount in a funding wallet as a sign of credibility. Diving into real-life examples is one of the best ways to understand scams and the possible solutions. Here’s the experience of BeInCrypto writer Ananda Banerjee. Ananda received his January salary in crypto. In early February, he decided to off-ramp his crypto earnings — selling USD using Binance’s P2P platform. Ananda chose the Express P2P order option and was automatically matched with a buyer offering a decent price to buy USDT. After verifying that the funds came from a legitimate source and noting the buyer’s positive feedback, he completed the sale. A month later, Axis Bank, where Ananda holds his account, placed a lien on the transaction amount following a complaint from the Cyber Crime section of Gurugram, Haryana. Additionally, a similar complaint was raised from Rajkot, Gujarat. This indicated that the funds Ananda received were acquired illegally by the buyer. The complaints and the subsequent lien on Ananda’s account imply that the buyer who purchased crypto from Ananda used illicitly obtained funds. This could also be a case of identity fraud, where the verified buyer might have used someone else’s account to transfer funds. However, the situation remains unclear due to the less-than-cooperative nature of police and banking officials in India. They often do not disclose the complete report of what transaction was flagged and why it was flagged. Despite Ananda not being a trader and simply receiving his salary in crypto, police questioned how he received his funds, demonstrating a lack of understanding of international salary structures. Here is the letter Ananda received from the bank. Notice how key information isn’t disclosed: This case highlights the importance of thorough verification and cautious trading practices, even when using reputed platforms like Binance P2P. It also underscores the challenges faced by crypto users in India due to regulatory and legal ambiguities. Ananda’s scenario outline in our case study isn’t a one-off. The CryptoIndia subreddit further demonstrates the proliferation of scams on the platform across the region. Every second day, a concern is raised by those engaged in P2P trading, showcasing how precarious the situation is. But then, people are optimistic about the fix, not because the government has started to pay attention but now that Binance has agreed to adhere to the FIU guidelines. Here is what one trader had to say regarding FIU compliance: “FlU compliance itself means that you are dealing with a trusted party and the Govt can’t hold you accountable for receiving funds from a compliant counterparty. They will either remove the P2P feature or make sure it is somehow compliant. Expect more scrutiny when sending and receiving funds via the new Binance. It will definitely not be convenient, and funds might take longer to process, especially if they have doubts about the source.” While India’s P2P markets are hotbeds for scams, numerous other instances of P2P and other exchange-specific frauds have surfaced globally. Here are a few notable ones: In Nigeria, scammers frequently use fake proof of payment to deceive sellers into releasing their Bitcoin (BTC) or other cryptocurrencies. A common method involves scammers sending fake bank transfer receipts or screenshots to the seller. A seller received a fake bank notification from a scammer claiming to have transferred funds via GTBank. The seller, believing the notification to be genuine, released the BTC, only to find out later that the money was never deposited. This emphasizes the importance of verifying payment by logging into your bank account rather than trusting notifications. In Kenya, a common scam involves a man-in-the-middle attack, where the scammer intercepts communications between the buyer and seller, facilitating a fraudulent transaction. A scammer posed as both a buyer and a seller on Binance P2P. They directed a legitimate buyer to send payment to a legitimate seller while intercepting the communication. The seller, believing the payment was from the buyer, released the cryptocurrency to the scammer’s wallet. The bank involved was Equity Bank. This type of scam can be prevented by ensuring all communication is conducted within the P2P platform. In Brazil, scammers set up fake escrow services to conduct P2P transactions. These malicious actors create professional-looking websites or services that appear legitimate but are designed to steal funds. A seller agreed to use an escrow service suggested by the buyer. The service looked professional, with a well-designed website and customer support. However, after the buyer sent the payment to the fake escrow service, the seller never received the cryptocurrency, and the escrow service disappeared. Banco do Brasil was mentioned in the complaint filed by the victim. This scam underscores the importance of using only well-known and verified escrow services provided by reputable P2P platforms. In South Africa, chargeback fraud is common. Her,e scammers use reversible payment methods like credit cards to reverse payments after receiving the cryptocurrency. A seller received a payment via the First National Bank (FNB) credit card and released the cryptocurrency. A few days later, the seller was notified by the bank that the payment had been reversed due to a chargeback request from the buyer. The seller lost both the cryptocurrency and the payment, illustrating the risks associated with accepting reversible payment methods on P2P platforms. And it’s not just Binance. Other exchanges in other countries have also seen a surge in such instances. In Canada, a prevalent P2P scam involves fraudsters impersonating technical support staff from well-known cryptocurrency exchanges like NDAX or Shakepay. They contact victims through unofficial channels such as social media or messaging apps, claiming that their accounts have issues that need urgent attention. A victim received a message on Telegram from someone claiming to be NDAX support, stating there was suspicious activity on their account. The scammer asked for login credentials and remote access to their device. Once access was granted, the scammer initiated unauthorized transactions, transferring funds out of the victim’s account. This highlights the importance of only communicating through official channels and never sharing login details. If you want to try out other P2P platforms, here are some of the Binance alternatives or, rather, Binance competitors to consider: In addition to the mentioned names, you can also use other platforms, including Bisq and Paxful, to buy and sell crypto among peers. If buyers and sellers remain vigilant, scammers may begin to realize that operating successfully on this platform is no longer feasible. However, even with the strongest crypto security standards, crypto scams aren’t expected to end anytime soon. Opportunists and bad actors will likely always operate within emerging and decentralized ecosystems. To combat these threats, the focus should be on improving the quality of issue handling and legal avenues offered to those who fall victim to scammers, plus improving education and awareness around platform risk. Information is key. By being aware of the Binance P2P scams listed in this guide, users can take the necessary steps to protect themselves and their crypto assets when trading on the platform. To avoid crypto scams regarding Binance P2P buying and Binance P2P selling, you need to verify the payments, use the Binance P2P trading escrow service, communicate clearly with the other party, and even verify the counterparty details. Also, do not give out personal details or refrain from accepting third-party payments from buyers you are looking to sell Bitcoin (BTC) to. While Binance P2P offers various advantages, such as zero trading fees and a robust escrow service, it also has some issues. Despite security measures, Binance p2p scams like payment fraud, chargeback fraud, and identity theft can occur. Scammers may use fake payment proofs or stolen identities to defraud users. Users in certain regions may also face additional scrutiny from banks and regulatory bodies, which can lead to account freezes and legal complications. The reliance on a centralized escrow system means that Binance holds the funds during transactions. While this reduces scam risks, it also means users must trust Binance with their funds, which some may view as a drawback in the decentralized world of cryptocurrency. No, transactions on Binance P2P are not tax-free. The tax implications of trading on Binance P2P depend on your country’s tax laws and regulations regarding cryptocurrency transactions: If you are making a profit from Binance p2p trading, it is generally considered taxable income. This includes profits from buying and selling crypto such as BTC and USDT. In many jurisdictions, cryptocurrency transactions are subject to capital gains tax. This applies to the difference in value when you buy crypto at a lower price and sell crypto at a higher price. Countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, and India require individuals to report their cryptocurrency transactions and pay taxes accordingly. Failure to do so can result in penalties.

136::https://blockworks.co/news/music-industry-blockchain-bandcamp::Blockworks::article::The music industry could learn a few lessons from blockchain::Opinion: Digital ownership is inevitable, but let’s be realistic about the problems it solves.::Bandcamp’s drama and community response has reminded us that the investments we make into centralized internet products are neither owned by us nor permanent Midjourney modified by Blockworks I spent twenty years building digital music applications and businesses, most recently Beats Music and Apple Music, previously with Yahoo!, Winamp, Topspin and Beastie Boys. Today, I work at Ledger and espouse the utility of crypto instead, so I’m often asked the question, “What about music on the blockchain?” “Meh,” is my standard response. I don’t see the innovation or consumer need in asking people to buy digital music NFTs like they bought CDs, or trying to shoehorn digital ownership into streaming services meant to compete with Spotify. Listening to music on the internet is a solved problem, and music listeners don’t need the help of a blockchain to hear what they want. Just say, “Hey Siri, play The Beatles,” to remind yourself just how far we’ve come since Napster. The business of music rights is an oligopoly controlled by three major labels and four digital music services, none of whom have an interest in open standards. But the two-sided marketplace of Bandcamp is a great place to consider the value blockchains can and will add to the artist/fan relationship, and how that change will come slowly over the next fifteen years. Below is a thought exercise using Bandcamp to demonstrate where digital ownership can meaningfully change the paradigm without asking consumers to change their habits all at once. For music fans — and in particular, fans of niche genres such as heavy metal and contemporary jazz — Bandcamp is beloved. The site launched in 2008 and bloomed slowly, building a passionate community of music lovers over fifteen years. The functionality of Bandcamp.com is simple: Stream for free, buy digital for around $10, and often buy vinyl (Bandcamp actually bought a pressing plant to help the creator side of their marketplace press vinyl), as well as t-shirts or other physical collectibles from the artist. Artists receive a net average of 82% of every sale, and Bandcamp has paid out around $1 billion to artists and labels selling on the site since its launch. But in March 2022, Bandcamp was sold to Epic Games. “Bandcamp will play an important role in Epic’s vision to build out a creator marketplace ecosystem,” Epic Games wrote in a statement. Bandcamp unionized in March 2023, and when Epic Games announced it was laying off 16% of its total workforce in September, a sale of Bandcamp to Songtradr was announced. Only 50% of the Bandcamp staff was retained and the community voiced its concern for the future of Bandcamp loudly culminating in this Pitchfork article: “Is Bandcamp as we know it over?”. Bandcamp’s drama and community response has reminded us — like MySpace, Flickr and so many other platforms before — that the investments we make into centralized internet products are neither owned by us nor permanent. At the end of the day, these are for-profit companies with investors looking for outcomes. Our investments into the platform are of value for them, not for us. The digital albums purchased, as well as the “relationship” between the artist and consumer, are owned by Bandcamp. If they disappear, so does the artist’s access to their fanbase and the listener’s backup of the music they’ve paid for. With decentralized ownership, this could be fundamentally different. If I were at the helm, here is how I would modify Bandcamp: The ambitions could be set higher than I suggest above — digital packaging and payouts to creative collaborators like Metalabel is building would be very useful in the Bandcamp context. Read more from our opinion section: You aren’t thinking hard enough about digital art You could also imagine artists earning ownership in Bandcamp based on performance and a revenue stream for artists where the profits of the platform are paid out based on this ownership (what Visa was for banks, Bandcamp could be for artists). But I like the simple thought experience described in the bullet points above particularly because the changes are subtle and simple, yet meaningful to both artists and fans, without asking either to change their behavior overnight. But we should keep this in perspective — the entire recorded music industry made $26 billion in revenue in 2022, whereas Bandcamp has paid out just $1 billion to artists since 2008. Also, the examples above speak to how application developers in categories beyond music will integrate digital ownership slowly and optionally for their customers, rather than a Web3 “big bang” overnight. Digital ownership is inevitable, but let’s be realistic about the problems it solves and how quickly this new paradigm is arriving to mainstream consumers.

However, it has since plummeted, now sitting at an 84% decrease from its all-time high. Etherscan, the Ethereum blockchain explorer, reveals that although SHIBA is not available on centralized crypto trading platforms such as Coinbase and Binance, it has garnered significant trading volume, reaching almost $250,000 million within a 24-hour span on Uniswap, a well-known decentralized exchange. CryptoGlobe reported the surge in SHIBA’s price earlier this month, linking the price hike to the token’s low liquidity. Ethereum blockchain data indicates that SHIBA has been part of 28,200 transactions and is held by 2,047 owners. The cryptocurrency has experienced a sharp decline in value, dropping approximately 84.4% from its highest point at $0.0000000078, now hovering around $0.00000000121. On its official website, SHIBA positions itself as the “rebirth of the DOGE killer,” expressing anticipation for a new leader in the crypto space while highlighting the enthusiasm of Shiba whales. The site also addresses past disappointments in the market, stating, “the Shiba whales have their eyes blazing,” and proclaiming that it’s “time for the birth of a new king, a new Doge Killer of 2023, $SHIBA.” SHIBA’s token supply structure is detailed on its website, explaining that 47% of the total, equivalent to 470 trillion tokens, are set to be “burned at launch.” An additional 300 trillion tokens will be “removed from circulation at launch.” The token allocation includes 5% for potential listings on centralized exchanges, 5% for a “marketing and development fund,” 4% for an ecosystem fund, 4% for funding cross-chain trading platforms, and another 5% designated for the project’s team. In a move reminiscent of its meme-crypto counterpart Shiba Inu ($SHIB), SHIBA has also introduced a token named $BONES, designated as the “official gas token for Shibarium chain.” source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

138::https://cryptobriefing.com/crypto-talent-grants-nibiru/::Crypto Briefing::article::Nibiru COO highlights grants as a magnet for TradFi talent in crypto::Jonathan Chang shares his transition from the traditional market to crypto, and what skills were valuable when pivoting.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article The presence of crypto among institutional investors is on the rise, especially after the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US. Companies such as JPMorgan, UBS, and Wells Fargo declared Bitcoin ETF holdings in their recent 13F filings. This rise in institutional interest can also be seen in the professional area. Executives with backgrounds in traditional finance (TradFi) are rotating to crypto as the market matures. Former Credit Suisse and JPMorgan Jonathan Chang, is one of these executives, now in the role of COO at layer-1 blockchain Nibiru. He shared insights with Crypto Briefing on valuable TradFi skills that can be used in crypto, how grants are a powerful tool to attract more of the traditional market, and how those professionals can help solve crypto issues. Crypto Briefing – What was your biggest challenge when pivoting from traditional finance to crypto? What set of skills learned from TradFi were most valuable when joining this new market? Jonathan Chang – Crypto is known for its unique complexities. Traditional Finance (TradFi) offers a more relatable framework for understanding decentralized finance due to its familiar concepts. However, there is still a learning curve, particularly with the specialized terminology used in crypto. For instance, while the principles of lending, including borrowers, underwriting, credit assessment, and lenders are well-established in TradFi, the application of these concepts in crypto—built on smart contract platforms and enhanced with tokenomics—introduces a new layer of complexity. In fintech, the ledger is fundamental for recording bank transactions. This concept closely parallels the blockchain ledger used in crypto, which also records transactions but does so in a decentralized way. I’ve noticed that fintech and crypto startups often share similar goals, particularly in speeding up payments and financial services. The main difference lies in the technology stacks each uses to achieve these goals. Now that I’m more involved in crypto, my background in traditional finance is proving beneficial. My experience in equity research enhanced my analytical and writing skills, and deepened my understanding of how markets moved. In investment banking, I refined my abilities in structuring transactions, managing teams, and general soft skills. Venture capital and growth equity offered opportunities to meet diverse founders, understand market mapping, and appreciate business differentiation. These skills were invaluable, aiding in process management, quality control, and leveraging a broad network in new environments. Often, creative problem-solving is essential, and having a variety of experiences from high-pressure situations has become increasingly valuable. These reference points from my past work are helpful tools in navigating and innovating within crypto. Crypto Briefing – Are grants a valuable way to attract talent to crypto? Do you think of grants as just a money incentive, or do you think of a proper introduction to the market and its technologies? Jonathan Chang – Grants play a crucial role in drawing talent to the crypto and DeFi sectors, providing much more than just financial incentives. In a time when funding is limited and developers and entrepreneurs urgently need resources to bring their ideas to life, grants offer vital early support. Equally important, however, is the comprehensive ecosystem support that a well-designed grant program provides. This includes access to mentorship, technical resources, and a network of like-minded innovators, fostering an environment ripe for learning, experimentation, and growth. At Nibiru, our grant program is crafted to achieve these goals. We offer financial assistance and leverage our extensive network and expertise to enhance our grantees’ success. This support includes connecting them with VC partners, offering mentorship opportunities, and providing access to our advanced developer suite. Our objective is to give a complete introduction to the market and the tools needed to succeed. The Nibiru ecosystem is dedicated to empowering developers, helping them become catalysts for positive Web3 transformation. Our grants initiative not only supports through partnerships and mentorship but also boosts the visibility of projects within our ecosystem with targeted marketing support. Our grants are structured with Total Value Locked (TVL) milestones in mind, aiming to find partners committed to long-term growth within the chain. During our diligence process, the chemistry between the founder and our team is a key factor in ensuring aligned goals and collaborative potential. Crypto Briefing – Despite being better, crypto UX is still a threshold to capture more users and talent. Do you believe that non-native crypto talent’s point of view is an important piece to solve this problem? Jonathan Chang – Absolutely. A major challenge in the crypto industry today is the complexity of the user experience. Despite significant innovation, many blockchain applications remain too complex for the average user. This is where non-native crypto talent becomes crucial. These individuals may not possess deep technical knowledge of blockchain but offer fresh perspectives and a strong focus on user-centric design. They are key to bridging the gap between sophisticated technology and the seamless, user-friendly experiences that people expect. At Nibiru, we see this in action. Our team, drawn from a mix of backgrounds, including traditional finance, technology, and consumer industries, brings diverse viewpoints that are critical in developing relatable products. They challenge us to simplify and humanize our offerings, urging us to prioritize the user journey over technical details. As a result, they help us create not just functional but genuinely enjoyable experiences. So, to directly answer your question—yes, I firmly believe that non-native crypto talent is essential in addressing the UX challenges in crypto.

139::https://theconversation.com/blockchains-focusing-on-bitcoin-misses-the-real-revolution-in-digital-trust-58125::The Conversation::article::Blockchains: Focusing on bitcoin misses the real revolution in digital trust::The transaction system underlying the bitcoin network has far broader uses than easing financial transfers – including identifying people and tracking property ownership.::In 2008, short of sending a suitcase full of cash, there was essentially just one way for an individual to send money between, say, the United States and Europe. You had to wire the money through a mainstream financial service, like Western Union or a bank. That meant paying high fees and waiting up to several days for the money to arrive. A radically new option arose in 2009 with the introduction of bitcoin. Bitcoin makes it possible to transfer value between two individuals anywhere in the world quickly and at minimal cost. It is often called a “cryptocurrency,” as it is purely digital and uses cryptography to protect against counterfeiting. The software that executes this cryptography runs simultaneously on computers around the world. Even if one or more of these computers is misused in an attempt to corrupt the bitcoin network (such as to steal money), the collective action of the others ensures the integrity of the system as a whole. Its distributed nature also enables bitcoin to process transactions without the fees, antiquated networks and (for better or worse) the rules governing intermediaries like banks and wire services. Bitcoin’s exciting history and social impact have fired imaginations. The aggregate market value of all issued bitcoins today is roughly US$10 billion. The computing devices that maintain its blockchain are geographically dispersed and owned by thousands of different individuals, so the bitcoin network has no single owner or point of control. Even its creator remains a mystery (despite many efforts to unmask her, him or them). Bitcoin’s lack of government regulation made it attractive to black markets and malware writers. Although the core system is well-secured, people who own bitcoins have experienced a litany of heists and fraud. Even more than the currency itself, though, what has drawn the world’s attention are the unprecedented reliability and security of bitcoin’s underlying transaction system, called a blockchain. Researchers, entrepreneurs, and developers believe that blockchains will solve a stunning array of problems, such as stabilization of financial systems, identification of stateless persons, establishing title to real estate and media, and efficiently managing supply chains. Despite its richly varied applications, a blockchain such as bitcoin’s aims to realize a simple goal. Abstractly, it can be viewed as creating a kind of public bulletin board, often called a “distributed ledger.” This ledger is public. Anyone – plebeian or plutocrat, baker or banker – can read it. And anyone can write valid data to it. Specifically, in bitcoin, any owner of money can add a transaction to the ledger that transfers some of her money to someone else. The bitcoin network makes sure that the ledger includes only authorized transactions, meaning those digitally signed by the owners of the money being transferred. The key feature of blockchains is that new data may be written at any time, but can never be changed or erased. At first glance, this etched-in-stone rule seems a needless design restriction. But it gives rise to a permanent, ever-growing transactional history that creates strong transparency and accountability. For example, the bitcoin blockchain contains a record of every transaction in the system since its birth. This feature makes it possible to prevent account holders from reneging on transactions, even if their identities remain anonymous. Once in the ledger, a transaction is undeniable. The indelible nature of the ledger is much more powerful and general, though, allowing blockchains to support applications well beyond bitcoin. Consider, for example, the management of title to a piece of land or property. Property registries in many parts of the world today are fragmented, incomplete, poorly maintained, and difficult to access. The legal uncertainty surrounding ownership of property is a major impediment to growth in developing economies. Were property titles authoritatively and publicly recorded on a blockchain, anyone could learn instantly who has title to a piece of property. Even legitimate anonymous ownership – as through a private trust – could be recorded on a blockchain. Such transparency would help resolve legal ambiguity and shed light on malfeasance. Advocates envision similar benefits in blockchain recording of media rights – such as rights to use images or music – identity documents and shipping manifests. In addition, the decentralized nature of the database provides resilience not just to technical failures, but also to political ones – failed states, corruption and graft. Blockchains can be enhanced to support not just transactions, but also pieces of code known as smart contracts. A smart contract is a program that controls assets on the blockchain – anything from cryptocurrency to media rights – in ways that guarantee predictable behavior. A smart contract may be viewed as playing the role of a trusted third party: Whatever task it is programmed to do, it will carry out faithfully. Suppose for example that a user wishes to auction off a piece of land for which her rights are represented on a blockchain. She could hire an auctioneer, or use an online auction site. But that would require her and her potential customers to trust, without proof, that the auctioneer conducts the auction honestly. To achieve greater transparency, the user could instead create a smart contract that executes the auction automatically. She would program the smart contract with the ability to deliver the item to be sold and with rules about minimum bids and bidding deadlines. She would also specify what the smart contract is to do at the end of the auction: send the winning bid amount from the winner to the seller’s account and transfer the land title to the winner. Because the blockchain is publicly visible, anyone with suitable expertise could check that the code in the smart contract implements a fair and valid auction. Auction participants would only need to trust the correctness of the code. They wouldn’t need to rely on an auctioneer to run the auction honestly – and as an added benefit, they also wouldn’t need to pay high auctioneer fees. Behind this compelling vision lurk many technical challenges. The transparency and accountability of a fully public ledger have many benefits, but are at odds with confidentiality. Suppose the seller mentioned above wanted to conduct a sealed-bid auction or conceal the winning bid amount? How could she do this on a blockchain that everyone can read? Achieving both transparency and confidentiality on blockchains is in fact possible, but requires new techniques under development by researchers. Another challenge is ensuring that smart contracts correctly reflect user intent. A lawyer, arbiter or court can remedy defects or address unforeseen circumstances in written contracts. Smart contracts, though, are expressly designed as unalterable code. This inflexibility avoids ambiguity and cheating and ensures trustworthy execution, but it can also cause brittleness. An excellent example was the recent theft of around $55 million in cryptocurrency from a smart contract. The thief exploited a software bug, and the smart contract creators couldn’t fix it once the contract was running. Bitcoin is a proof of concept of the viability of blockchains. As researchers and developers overcome the technical challenges of smart contracts and other blockchain innovations, marveling at money flying across the Atlantic will someday seem quaint.::2016-07-18T10:17:17Z::Bitcoin, Blockchain, Smart contract::Ari Juels::Home::https://images.theconversation.com/files/130594/original/image-20160714-23327-ng4s5m.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C184%2C1600%2C776&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
140::https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/01/26/which-is-the-best-self-custody-lightning-wallet/::CoinDesk::article::Which Is the Best Self-Custody Lightning Wallet?::Bitcoin educator Anita Posch tested the Blixt, Green, Mutiny, Phoenix and Zeus Lightning wallets while traveling in Zimbabwe. Lightning wallets tested and goal Choosing the test location The testing process Payment costs Features and differences Second test in urban area with LTE connection Overall rankings for Lightning self-custody Conclusion::I'm conducting my second test of self-custodial Lightning wallets in Zimbabwe, to see which might be best for any rural area. Given that none of the available self-custodial wallets are developed by Africans, they are rarely used or tested here. On top of that, Lightning is still new and complex, building mobile apps that are running a node of the network on your phone is challenging. I am here to find out what works and what does not. As an educator, I recommend tools for everyday users, who want to send small payments. These tools have to be reliable, otherwise people might conclude that Bitcoin isn't for them. Anita Posch is a world-renowned Bitcoin educator, author of the book "(L)earn Bitcoin" and founder of the online academy Crack the Orange as well as non-profit initiative Bitcoin for Fairness. I opened my first Lightning channel on an app called BLW in January 2019. I’m used to testing new tools, that’s why I have no problem if challenges and bugs arise. But regular users may not be as forgiving, that’s why I aim to only recommend tools I’ve personally tested. In 2023, the only two self-custody Lightning wallets available were Breez and Phoenix. This year I had more choices and tested: Blixt, Mutiny, Green, Zeus and Phoenix. I also included the Wallet of Satoshi, a custodial wallet, just to see how it performs in comparison. I was familiar with Phoenix and used Zeus connected to my Voltage node earlier. Mutiny, Blixt and the Lightning integration in Blockstream’s Green wallet just popped up in the last few months, so using them was new for me too. All of the wallets have been undergoing huge changes and will continue to evolve. I had to download Mutiny manually and install a special .apk file used on Android phones. For the Green wallet, I asked BlockStream to unlock its experimental Greenlight feature in order to test it. My goal was to find out which of the wallets are the best in sending and receiving bitcoin in a reliable, fast, easy to use manner and to compare the costs involved. See also: Coinbase CEO Confirms Exchange Will Support Lightning Before heading to the rural areas (I intended to test the wallets under suboptimal conditions), I set up the wallets and opened a Lightning payments channel in Harare as I anticipated low internet signal challenges. Based on my year-long experience in Zimbabwe, I’ve learned that even with decent internet speed, the upload and download of files as small as 2 MB can be problematic. I used the internet at a friend’s house to use the fastest internet provider in Harare called Liquid, which is also the most expensive with a monthly cost of $300 for unlimited usage. My speed test results for download were 92.7 Mbps and upload 14.6 Mbps. Even with that fast internet it took me some time to install the apps, secure the private keys and open a Lightning channel to be a part of the network. To ensure consistency, I followed a test protocol for each wallet. On Dec. 26 and 27, I installed the wallets and sent 100,000 sats (~$42 at current prices) to open a Lightning channel. A channel on the Lightning Network needs two transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain to be set up. That way the channel is constantly connected to the blockchain, which is why the bitcoin on the Bitcoin blockchain and bitcoin on the Lightning network are the same. There is no difference in the value, it’s the same unit, not another token or asset. There are several ways to open a channel: sending on-chain bitcoin, transferring Lightning directly from another wallet or through a swap from Liquid or some wallets are offering buying inbound liquidity. I tried them all to send the first bitcoin to the wallets, affecting set-up speed and fees I had to pay. See also: Bitcoin Could See Growth in Layer-2 Ecosystem, Drawing on Ethereum's Experience I used a Lightning payment to open a channel on all wallets, except for Blixt, as I only found the on-chain option there (except for liquidity providers). Seemingly, Blixt is opening the channel with a second on-chain transaction while the other wallets conceal that second transaction somehow, because the channel opened immediately after the first transaction confirmation. Not with Blixt: I sent the first transaction and the confirmation took some hours, it was evening already, so I had to leave the friend's house. As soon as it was confirmed, Blixt carried out the second on-chain transaction, which took again several hours because the mempool was full. When the second transaction was confirmed I was back in the house where I'm living, with internet speed only around 3 Mbps download, 0.26 upload and a Ping over 300ms. Blixt wasn't able to open the channel in these circumstances. I needed to go back to my friend's house to finish the channel opening. It's hard to say how other wallets would have performed under these conditions. For the channel openings on Green and Zeus, I used Liquid, swapped via Boltz.exchange to Lightning, due to high transaction fees at the time. Opening a channel from Liquid is far more economical in that situation. Liquid is a sidechain of Bitcoin, its unit is called L-BTC. Learn the differences between Bitcoin, Lightning, Liquid, and E-Cash in this non-technical explainer. One BTC is pegged to one L-BTC. This means if you peg-in 0.1 BTC to Liquid, the resulting 0.1 L-BTC are of the same value as BTC. Compared to self-custodial Lightning there is more trust involved in using Liquid, because you have to go through intermediaries for the peg-in and peg-out and trust a federation of 15 companies, who are the signers for Liquid transactions, whereas on Bitcoin and Lightning you don‘t have to trust any intermediaries. The upside of the Liquid blockchain is that the transaction speed, privacy are higher and currently the fees are lower than on the Bitcoin blockchain. I compared all network fees, transaction, and service fees that applied with the different methods of opening a channel. The cost of the incoming transaction to open the channel was the highest with Blixt as I used bitcoin on-chain at a time when the average fee rate was 110 sat/vByte ($0.000054). Channel opening was the cheapest when using Lightning directly from another LN wallet. The route using Liquid and Boltz was a little bit more expensive than using Lightning. The available balance after opening the channel varied significantly. Zeus had the lowest balance of 52,500 sats, while Green had the highest at 97,500 sats. This difference was surprising, especially since I used Liquid for both. Green was the clear winner with a cost of 3.5%, whereas Zeus was by far the most expensive wallet with 48.5% of the funds spent in opening the channel. Mutiny offered the biggest channel capacity and the highest receivable amount with 100,000 sats, while at the same time it was the second most expensive. However, a drawback of Green was its limited incoming capacity of only 4,133 sats. After the initial set-up, I set out to do the payment test on Jan. 1, 2024. I strolled through the scorching heat, making my way up to the kopje, navigating through rocks, grass, bushes and trees 30 km out of the capitaI Harare. My friends were captivated by the beautiful flowers that bloom as soon as the rainy season begins. My focus, however, was on finding a decent internet signal for my two phones. Having prepared the test back in Harare, I was eager to carry it out in this setting. After 30 minutes of searching, I realized that the network coverage was inconsistent, regardless of whether I used NetOne or Econet. I was able to send WhatsApp messages, but as soon as I wanted to download an image with 0.5 MB, I had to wait or turn airplane mode on and off to be back in the game. Finally, I settled on a shaded spot with a stable NetOne signal to set up a hotspot for my other devices. I prepared my devices – my Google Pixel 4, iPhone 13 Pro and my iPad Air (3rd generation). The iPad was included because I already had Phoenix wallets on my other two devices, and for this test, I wanted to start with a fresh installation. Now seated on some rocks, surrounded by trees and bushes, as I fend off large ants attempting to crawl up under my trousers I found 4.21 Mbps download and 0.36 Mbps upload. Glad that I set up the apps already a few days earlier. See also: Bitcoin and Stablecoins Will Bring Crypto Mass Adoption to Africa My speed test results showed a ping of 90 and a download speed of 4.6 Mbps and an upload speed 0.5 Mbps. When I started testing the wallets, the Phoenix wallet opened immediately. The Green wallet took 13 seconds to open and the Mutiny wallet needed 18 seconds. However, Zeus didn't open at all, even after a 150-second wait. Similarly, Blixt opened but failed to sync the channels and wallet, so I couldn't use it. As expected, the custodial Wallet of Satoshi opened immediately. My first test was to send 50,000 sats from the different wallets to my Phoenix wallet on my iPhone. So, the Phoenix wallet on the iPhone was on the receiving end. Unfortunately, I could not send from Blixt because, as I said before, it did not sync at all. Zeus was also unusable since it wouldn't even start up. When I attempted a payment with Zeus, it failed after a five minute wait. The Green wallet's payment attempt was unsuccessful too, displaying an error message after I waited for two and a half minutes. With the Mutiny wallet, I almost wanted to stop but after 50 seconds, I was able to send the payment successfully. The Phoenix wallet was the quickest, completing the transfer in just three seconds. And interestingly, the custodial Wallet of Satoshi was slower than Phoenix, taking nine seconds for the payment to go through. I didn't anticipate this result, but I found it amusing. The next test focused on receiving 30,000 sats from the Phoenix wallet on my iPhone, which had previously served as the receiving wallet. The results were somewhat similar to the previous test. The time until the payment was sent from Phoenix was three seconds and it showed up in Mutiny, Phoenix and the Wallet of Satoshi immediately. Blixt did not work. With Green, the payment failed after I waited for 35 seconds. Similarly, Zeus also failed to receive the payment after I waited for one and half minutes. For this test, I sent 20,000 sats to a Lightning address, using the Wallet of Satoshi as the recipient since I had access to its Lightning address. The results were somewhat consistent with previous tests but with a notable exception. Surprisingly, the Green wallet managed to send to a Lightning address this time, completing the payment in 40 seconds. This was unexpected given its previous failures in other tests. Blixt and Zeus didn't work. Mutiny, Phoenix and Wallet of Satoshi, as anticipated, successfully completed the payments to a Lightning address. I wanted to test whether I could exchange 20,000 sats for Liquid in these conditions, just to be confident in recommending it to my followers. For the Lightning to Liquid swap I was using the Boltz.exchange website, with the Green wallet set as the recipient. I didn't attempt the swap with Blixt, Green and Zeus since their earlier payment attempts had failed. Surprisingly Mutiny failed in this swap; the payment did not go through even after I waited for two minutes. Both Phoenix and the Wallet of Satoshi successfully completed the swap from Lightning to Liquid Bitcoin. Also here the custodial Wallet of Satoshi was slower compared to the self-custodial Phoenix wallet. The differences in fees for the payments were marginal, just around 100 to 200 sats, which is negligible. The costs for sending and receiving were roughly the same across different wallets. However, the costs associated with opening a channel varied significantly. Notably, the Green wallet was the cheapest option, requiring only 3% of the transferred amount as fees. On the other hand, Zeus was the most expensive in these terms. In terms of payment reliability, Phoenix and the Wallet of Satoshi stood out as the most dependable. This isn't surprising for the Wallet of Satoshi, given its custodial nature. Following closely was Mutiny, which successfully completed three out of four payment attempts. Green, however, managed only one successful payment out of four. Phoenix showed remarkable reliability, successfully processing all four payments. I even managed to send 11 sats from my Phoenix wallet to my Alby Lightning address under very challenging conditions with a download rate of only 0.15 Mbps, upload speed of 0.05 Mbps, and a ping of 185. Phoenix stands out as the clear winner in terms of payment speed. It was even faster than the custodial Wallet of Satoshi. Green and Mutiny also show satisfactory performance, provided they functioned correctly. I evaluated the wallets' features, focusing on their user-friendliness and security aspects. How easy is it to do a backup? Is the wallet open source? How well are the wallet users guided to ensure highest security standards are applied without their actions compromising them? I focused on the backup process, particularly favoring 12-word seed phrases, because this results in acceptable security and randomness for the private keys and it's easier to store 12 words than 24. Green and Phoenix use 12-word seeds, while Blixt, Mutiny and Zeus opt for 24-word seeds. A key aspect of product design is encouraging users to adopt high-security measures seamlessly. Being forced to write down the backup while opening the wallet is one of these good design features. I call it “forced backup” and only Green offers it. All the other wallets show a call to action only. Conversely, permitting the seed phrase to be copied to the device's clipboard for convenience may compromise the security of the funds. Uninformed users and newbies might copy it, send their seed per email to themselves, store it as a screenshot or in a Word document. I have seen it all. Convenience is the enemy of security. While it's true that users should only store small amounts in a Lightning wallet, it's also a fact that users will apply the same unsafe behavior to an on-chain wallet, because why not? Blixt allows copying the seed. Mutiny and Zeus too, but they at least warn their users. Green and Zeus are doing it the right way and prevent copying the seed, aligning with best security practices. I think cloud backups on the user side are not desirable. They can be a double-edged sword, offering convenience but also presenting potential security risks and accessibility issues. Many people in African countries don't have a Google Drive or iCloud account to secure their channels. For added security, I prefer to use a PIN, password, or pattern lock to secure a Bitcoin wallet. Otherwise, for example in case a security officer at an airport or a thief wants me to open my wallet, I can be forced to use my fingerprint or my Face ID. Blixt, Mutiny, Green and Zeus offer password or PIN-based security. Phoenix provided biometric options such as face ID or fingerprint recognition only, but I hope they consider making changes to this feature. See also: Gridless Uses Bitcoin Mining to Power Rural Africa A significant feature I value is whether the wallets offer a separate on-chain Bitcoin wallet. This is a great feature as users only need to install one app for Bitcoin and Lightning. Blixt, Mutiny, Green and Zeus provide a separate on-chain Bitcoin wallet. Phoenix does not. While it allows for swapping in and out, the functionality is integrated and not separated as a distinct Bitcoin wallet. Coin control is going to be more and more important as transaction fees are rising. We need Bitcoin mobile wallets allowing us to do coin control and choose different UTXOs for a transaction. Sadly, none of the tested wallets allows that. This limitation impacts users' ability to manage transaction costs effectively. While Green does offer coin control, it's only available in their desktop version, not on mobile. A Lightning address, similar in format to an email address, is a convenient feature that allows you to receive Lightning payments asynchronously without requiring the wallet to be actively open. Blixt offers a LN address in their experimental feature called "Lightning Box." Zeus is using hodl invoices, a solution that has been criticized by a few developers because of the complexity and the fact that holding invoices could affect the performance of the Lightning Network overall. The other self-custody wallets do not offer Lightning addresses. Given this, it might be a better option to use custodial services like getalby.com or the Wallet of Satoshi for a Lightning address and to send the sats to a Bitcoin, Lightning or Liquid self-custody wallet from time to time. All the wallets allow payments to Lightning addresses. Only Phoenix offers auto channels at the moment. This means Phoenix is more convenient than other wallets, because you only have to set up one channel. The channel then dynamically adjusts its size if you send more funds to it than its liquidity allows. To keep your channel size consistent, you should not swap out to on-chain bitcoin as it reduces the size of the channel. In terms of fee settings, all wallets except Mutiny allow you to define the maximum Lightning fee you're willing to pay. This gives users some control over their payment costs. Regarding channel management, all wallets allow you to force close the channels. Additionally, Blixt, Zeus and Phoenix allow you to purchase inbound liquidity. After returning to town I tested the payments that failed a second time. I realized that Green’s experimental mode is really very experimental, because I could not send a single Lightning payment with Green and other people reported the same in the Blockstream Telegram group. Blixt was still not able to sync to the top of the blockchain and after five minutes of waiting I stopped the process. Zeus was able to sync and started the node, but then LND was taking a long time to get Zeus “ready to make payments” and after three minutes of waiting I closed the app. From my educator's perspective, my top choices are the Phoenix and Mutiny wallet. Everything works with Phoenix, you don’t need to worry about channel management and payments are even faster than with the custodial Wallet of Satoshi. The fees for payments in Phoenix might be off-putting, from that perspective one might look into Mutiny as it is convincing due to its user-friendliness, making it ideal for beginners. Mutiny’s channel opening was more expensive though and it doesn’t offer auto channels. Part of their business model is the optional Mutiny+ subscription for 16,000 sats per month. Green would be a strong recommendation, particularly for those who value additional options like Liquid and on-chain transactions in a single wallet with one seed. As long as their Lightning payments aren’t working, it’s a no-go obviously. Blixt and Zeus are more suited for advanced users due to their range of options, but they did not work in my tests. To choose the optimal wallet, it’s important to ask yourself what are the main goals and the features you’ll need. I've developed an online learning program that could help guide you in that endeavor. In summary, the evaluation of self-custodial Lightning wallets in rural Zimbabwe in 2024 revealed important insights. Wallets like Phoenix, Mutiny, Green, Zeus and Blixt were tested for their performance, reliability and user-friendliness. Opening channels with these wallets varied in cost and balance. Phoenix and the Wallet of Satoshi exhibited high reliability and speed, with Phoenix performing better than the custodial Wallet of Satoshi. From an educational standpoint, the wallets' features were assessed, emphasizing user-friendliness and security. Green and Phoenix offered user-friendly 12-word seed phrases, while Blixt, Mutiny and Zeus provided 24-word seeds. Green's "forced backup" was a notable security feature. Cloud backups raised concerns about user data security, as some wallets offered this option. App lock preferences and the availability of separate on-chain Bitcoin wallets were also considered. Phoenix topped the rankings for its overall performance and reliability, followed by Mutiny for its user-friendliness.

Many of its services are tailored for businesses and projects that require multi-step process automation. This guide covers everything you need to know about Guru Network and its native GURU token in 2024. The Guru Network is an innovative ecosystem of products and services. The network is developing an AI compute multi-chain layer for blockchain-based projects and apps looking to build or enhance AI functionality. The expansive project was initially launched as a decentralized exchange (DEXGuru Trading Terminal) and has since evolved into an all-in-one platform (Guru Network), merging real-world business processes with artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology. In 2024, the platform is a key driver in simplifying AI-focused application development and deployment. We've come a long way from being DeFi trading terminal to evolving into the Guru Network. What started as a tool for traders has transformed into a robust ecosystem for Web3 Automations and AI Compute. Let's dive into this! pic.twitter.com/mgP1uzbwyZ Guru Network provides a framework for blockchain business process automation (BBPA), which facilitates app development with minimal coding requirements. This abstracts the complexity away from its users, who, in turn, can focus on creating value for their own customers. The multi-chain AI compute layer will allow builders to natively embed orchestrated AI agents into their applications on multiple blockchains. The Guru Network contends with a number of limitations in current AI automation offerings for business. Modern-day AI models can be used for pattern recognition, natural language processing (NLP), data analysis, and many other menial tasks. However, there are a few real-world instances that expose the chinks in the armor of AI, thereby limiting its potential in business processes. For example, modern AI models struggle with automating processes that involve several stages. This makes it impractical to rely exclusively on such models in situations where objectives are complex. It’s very important to have a precise problem so that you can solve a precise problem. When you’re not clear, then it’s trying to solve a problem that you don’t even know what the problem is. Furthermore, when AI is used in large-scale operations or processes that involve multiple participants, it fails to scale. This drawback can pose significant bottlenecks in fast-paced environments. Lastly, AI systems lack confidence when interacting with real-world events and actions. This limits their potential to bridge the gap between the physical and digital realms effectively. Guru Network aims to solve some of these issues. By seamlessly merging blockchain and AI, Guru Network super-charges efficiency and ensures that applications are crucially context-aware, optimizing performance within a decentralized framework. The Guru Network offers a suite of features that enhance the functionality and efficiency of decentralized applications (DApps). These features ensure secure, scalable, and efficient operations across various sectors. The Flow Orchestrator acts as the central hub and coordinates activities across the network. It defines and dispatches business processes to the BBPA Engines and sources data from the Guru Data Warehouse, Block Explorer, and trading terminal (DexGuru). Essentially, the Guru Flow Orchestrator links AI models, on-chain processes, and off-chain data, ensuring a seamless flow of operations. This enhances efficiency and broadens the scope of DApps. This feature provides users with a minimal code development environment and a user-friendly interface that streamlines project creation and management. Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is a solution for transferring tokens and sending arbitrary message data to smart contracts on other blockchains. The integration of CCIP into Guru Network’s services ensures secure and efficient off-chain computations and data feeds. This architecture allows for improvements in scalability in sectors like finance, supply chain, and automated customer interactions. Furthermore, CCIP is functional on multiple EVM-compatible blockchains, which allows the Guru Network to expand its services to even more networks. Individual Agents on the Guru Network are similar to AWS Lambda functions. AWS Lambda functions are computing services that run code for applications in response to events or requests without the need to manage servers. Individual Agents, on the other hand, subscribe to tasks, execute various operations, and interact within the Guru Network’s economic framework. The tasks that they execute can vary widely, which may include: Missing those 2017 deep dives into crypto whitepapers?

Introducing the Interoperability Architecture WP:https://t.co/JiGsmtjprS pic.twitter.com/DcnUC7J4xH As previously mentioned, DexGuru is the trading terminal of the Guru Network. It was the first service offered by the network. DexGuru is a powerhouse of features, offering value to users in multiple ways. Some included elements are: These are just a few of the features offered by the trading terminal. Users can enjoy these and additional features that will aid them in on-chain analysis and trading. The Guru Network’s Block Explorer is essentially an Etherscan alternative for appchains. It offers some of the same features you see across standard block explorers, such as portfolio view, token balances, smart contract verification, and more. Some of the other advanced features it includes are tracing, an ABI Execution interface, TradingView charts, APIs for developers, and integration into EVM-compatible blockchains. These include: The Data Warehouse is an on-chain data access solution that supports data-intensive applications such as analytics, AI, and machine learning (ML). It provides advanced tools for data ingestion, visualization, and real-time streaming. With this tool, you can integrate your services with the Block Explorer, allowing for advanced data querying; utilize an AI-powered visual SQL editor; create dashboards to visualize complex data; integrate with data warehouses; use community-driven API endpoints; and more. The GURU Framework, a software development kit (SDK), is designed to streamline the development process for developing, deploying, and managing DApps. It gives users a set of tools and libraries that allow them to integrate AI into DApp development. Some of its specific features are integration with the Flow Orchestrator, access to the BBPA engines, synchronization of smart contracts across multiple blockchain networks, an API that bridges web2 and web3, the creation and management of individual agents, and the utilization of the Shared Event Bus. Several necessary participants are involved in the Guru Network, each with a unique task that creates a cohesive system for long-term sustainability. Here’s a snapshot of the setup: Users’ engagement in these roles is crucial, as it creates a feedback loop that generates value throughout the entire Guru network. This value is set to be further enhanced as governance mechanisms, hackathons, developer programs, and the Guru token enrich the ecosystem —and rewards and incentive features are rolled out. $GURU is the native token of the Guru network. It will be used for distributing revenue among many participants in the Guru ecosystem, such as contributors and stakers. As well as being a revenue distribution tool, the token will power the extensive Guru ecosystem. GURU will be utilized to pay transaction and service fees, AI usage and compute fees, Flow orchestrator fees, and more. $GURU token is about to drop. Target launch: end of May. Your best move now?

A number of projects have already integrated Guru’s services across several diverse sectors. Clear examples are Guru’s DexGuru, Block Explorer, and Data Warehouse. However, here are a few examples of other services: Guru Network is the brainchild of Evgeny Vakhteev and Nick Sawinyh. Sawinyh has over a decade of experience in growing and developing applications in the blockchain, crypto, and web3 space. He also has experience as a product and marketing leader and formerly founded Defiprime. Vakhteev is the current CTO of DexGuru, a trading terminal apart of the Guru Network. He has former experience as a software developer at Hulu and an even longer history as the CEO of multiple companies. Some of the other team members include: The DexGuru platform has raised at least $6 million in capital across two funding rounds. The first round, led by ParaFi Capital, raised $1 million. The second round amassed $5 million from familiar faces like Huobi, Wintermute, and Sandeep Nailwal and over a dozen other angel investors, companies, and firms. Some of these include: These investments have allowed the GURU Network to expand from its humble beginnings as a simple EVM-compatible trading terminal to the expansive platform that it is in 2024. In the first quarter of 2024, the project focused on access to the community and early adopters, the Phase 1 testnet for the Block Explorer and Data Warehouse, and the introduction of the Web3 Automation and AI platform.

142::https://blockworks.co/news/algorand-fork-voi-blockchain::Blockworks::article::Algorand fork Voi tries a blockchain reboot::The self-declared “community-powered blockchain” testing a new network based on Algrorand tech.::Exclusive: The self-declared “community-powered blockchain” testing a new network based on Algrorand tech Maurice NORBERT/Shutterstock, modified by Blockworks Veteran members of the Algorand proof-of-stake blockchain ecosystem have banded together to launch a new iteration of the open-source code, called Voi, which is currently in testnet. Leading the new project is Chris Swenor, co-founder of both Reach, a blockchain development platform and the Algorand decentralized exchange (DEX) HumbleSwap. Work on Voi began in 2022, with a premise that the blockchain should better align incentives with its community of developers and users, and motivated by Swenor’s frustration with perceived shortcomings within the crypto industry. “I looked around and I was so frustrated that I saw that [venture capitalists] and the early builders owned over 90% of all tokens, and the people that are actually still there during the bear market really didn’t own the chain, but they’re still there pouring their heart into it,” Swenor told Blockworks. Voi is only forking the Algorand code, but not the chain’s state. So, unlike the failed EthPoW fork of Ethereum, for instance, Voi will have its own crypto token, but one with no connection to ownership of ALGO. In software development, a repository fork is essentially a copy of a repository that allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. That’s what’s happening here, in contrast to an Algorand blockchain fork, which is not possible. Algorand has struggled to attract users in recent years. Its seven-day dex volume, for example, is currently less than $10 million, according to DeFi Llama, placing it 38th by that metric. Read more: Closure of largest DeFi destination underscores Algorand’s struggles Swenor’s critique is not specifically of Algorand or its development stewards Algorand Technologies and the Algorand Foundation, with which he said he maintains good relations. Blockworks reached out to both Algorand entities to learn more. As a long time developer within the Algorand tech stack, Swenor said it was natural to remain focused on the Algorand consensus engine. “The thing that was very clear is that the Algorand tech is literally the best tech that we’ve ever worked with, as far as speed and what it can deliver,” he said. One of the chief differences is that Voi’s developers have earmarked 75% of its entire market cap for “ecosystem growth.” That includes node runners, and the testnet has attracted nearly 500 nodes according to its explorer, though it’s not apparent how many of those are independently operated. “This means that a very small percentage of the overall network [token] is earmarked for operations and the core team,” Swenor said. Voi intends to concentrate on a smaller vertical of applications as part of its go-to-market strategy, emphasizing “membership infrastructure,” in contrast to Algorand’s institutional focus. But Swenor also expects to contribute to Algorand development by bringing in developers, and improving tooling such as wallet and node software. The new network counts original Algorand investor Arrington Capital among its seed investors along with Sonic Boom Ventures, founded by former Algorand, Inc. CEO Steven Kokinos, who sees it as complementary to Algorand. “I think what is exciting about Voi in particular is that they’ve done a lot of work to be able to connect Voi back to the Algorand mainnet and be able to exchange assets using tech like state proofs that was built into Algorand for that express purpose,” Kokinos told Blockworks. The remaining Algorand team was initially skeptical of Voi, Swenor said, but that changed over time. They’re seeing now that this is actually beneficial for Algorand as a whole…because we’re kind of at different missions and we’re going after different things, I don’t see them seeing it as a threat by any means,” he said.

China is on the list of nations crafting their own CBDCs – essentially digital money made by central banks. Though, it’s still early days for its mainstream use. At the moment, CBDCs are viewed mainly as the digital equivalent of physical cash. However, Lu Lei from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) shared in a forum that, thanks to its adaptable features, central banks might evolve CBDCs to act like M2 money, encompassing certain deposits and savings. To clarify, CBDC’s programmable aspects mean its settings can be tweaked. Imagine digital money that could expire or be set aside just for specific purchases. Lu anticipates the People’s Bank of China might look into these features to modify CBDC rates, which might then be leveraged to guide the broader economy. He also highlighted how CBDC-based international payments could make transactions more secure, easy, and inclusive. It’s worth noting that last year, Chinese banks joined a cross-border transaction trial led by the Bank of International Settlements. By the end of June, transactions using China’s digital currency, named e-CNY, reached about 1.8 trillion yuan (roughly $249.33 billion). However, the e-CNY available only represented a tiny fraction (0.16%) of China’s overall physical cash supply. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

144::https://cryptobriefing.com/kimsuky-hackinggroup-targets-southkorean-crypto/::Crypto Briefing::article::Kimsuky hacking group targets South Korean crypto firms with new malware — report::Kaspersky uncovers a potential link between Kimsuky and the notorious Lazarus Group.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Kimsuky, a North Korean hacking group, has reportedly been utilizing a new malware variant called “Durian” to launch targeted attacks on South Korean crypto firms. The incidence is highlighted in a recently published threat intelligence report from Kaspersky. According to Kaspersky’s research, the malware is deployed specifically to break and exploit against security software used by South Korean crypto firms, at least two of which have been identified. “Based on our telemetry, we pinpointed two victims within the South Korean cryptocurrency sector. The first compromise occurred in August 2023, followed by a second in November 2023. Notably, our investigation did not uncover any additional victims during these instances, indicating a highly focused targeting approach by the actor,” the report stated. The Durian malware is an “initial-stage” installer. It introduces supplementary malware and establishes a persistence mechanism inside the device or instance that it attacks. Once executed, the malware generates a stage loader and adds it to the exposed operating system for automatic execution. The malware’s installation is finalized with a culminating payload written over Golang, an open-source programming language developed by Google. The final payload then enables the execution of remote commands that instruct the exploited device to download and exfiltrate files. The choice of language is also suspect due to Golang’s efficiency for networked machines and large codebases. Interestingly, Kaspersky’s report also revealed that LazyLoad, one of the tools deployed by Durian, has been used by Andariel, a sub-group within the notorious North Korean hacking consortium Lazarus Group. This finding suggests a potential connection between Kimsuky and Lazarus, although Kaspersky described the link as “tenuous” at best. Lazarus Group, which first emerged in 2009, has established itself as one of the most notorious groups of crypto hackers. Independent onchain sleuth ZachXBT recently revealed that the group had successfully laundered over $200 million in ill-gotten crypto between 2020 and 2023. In total, Lazarus is accused of stealing over $3 billion in crypto assets in the six years leading up to 2023. Last week, a US court has ordered the forfeiture of 279 crypto accounts tied to North Korean threat incidents.

145::https://theconversation.com/how-blockchain-technology-is-about-to-transform-sharemarket-trading-53807::The Conversation::article::How blockchain technology is about to transform sharemarket trading::Blockchain technology has the potential to make share trading faster, more efficient and more transparent.::Recently the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) bought a $15 million stake in Digital Asset Holdings, a developer of blockchain technology. One of the main reasons is to upgrade its share registry system by using blockchain or distributed ledger technology. And it’s been reported that JP Morgan Chase is also partnering with Digital Asset Holdings to trial the technology. Put simply, blockchain technology is a method of recording and confirming transactions where instead of a centralised platform, participants each hold a complete record of transactions through peer to peer verification of transactions. This means there is no central recording system, rather each participant keeps a record of all transactions ever made. This is the same system which allows Bitcoin to operate with no central body. Instead of the ASX clearing house settling trades, trades will be settled by participants confirming transactions through the peer to peer network. The network (likely made up of brokers) will record the buyer and selling participants, the number of shares traded, price of shares, time of exchange and the exchange of funds. The ASX will still provide a centralised electronic exchange for participants to place orders, only the settlement or back office function will be sourced to the network. Blockchain has great potential to cut inefficiencies in the share settlement function. As trades are settled by peer confirmation, there is no need for a clearing house, auditors to verify trades and custodians to ensure a fund has the shares they say they hold. Essentially this is cutting out the middleman in the back office which means less costs in record keeping and in turn less costs to trading on the ASX. Given the high costs in getting a third party to audit, record keep and/or verify trades these costs are substantial. The peer confirmation of trades also means settlement can be almost instantaneous. Compare this to the current settlement period of three working days (‘T+3’) as the ASX needs to make sure the participants have the money and shares on hand to exchange. This would make shares a far more liquid investment – almost as good as having cash on hand. Higher liquidity means more investment into ASX shares. As all participants have the full record of transactions and therefore holdings of investors there is complete transparency in the equity market. This makes it almost impossible to falsify transactions or to alter prior transactions. If a false trade occurs, participants will find inconsistencies in their full ledger and reject the trade. For example an investor would be unable to sell stock that they did not own as all participants would know exactly how much stock the investor owns now. First, implementing a clearing system using blockchain will introduce a new type of fee. In the Bitcoin blockchain, miners process Bitcoin transactions by solving optimisation problems and get rewarded by newly created Bitcoins and settlement fees offered by Bitcoin users who wish to have their transactions processed. Miners prioritise the order of transactions to be cleared based on the fees offered and the difficulty of the problems to record the transaction in a block. This is what allows a blockchain to have no centralised clearing house. If the ASX blockchain requires investors to include transaction fees in order for their transactions to be cleared, then the ASX is transferring the cost of maintaining the back office to the investors. If this is to happen, investors will have to compete against each other to have their transactions cleared faster than those of others. Alternatively, if the new system doesn’t allow such fees and relies on brokers or other entities to clear the transactions, then the ASX is again transferring the cost of maintaining back office to those entities. The second concern is increased transparency. Under the proposed trading system, most of positions of the market participants could be exposed to the public as the trading ID can be identified. This could disadvantage many investors such as super, managed and hedge funds. For example, a super fund typically sells a large position on a gradual basis for a prolonged time period. In this process, it is critical not to be noticed by other traders who may take advantage of such large-scale sales. With complete transparency such as in blockchain, such a sell-off could not be applied effectively. Potentially this may make investors leave the ASX and seek more opaque venues to trade such as dark pools. Clearly a direct adoption of blockchain from Bitcoin technology would not be viable for the ASX. If the ASX is able to adopt blockchain technology and address privacy, security and trade transparency concerns then this would yield great cost savings to investors.::2016-02-03T19:05:23Z::Bitcoin, Blockchain::Adrian Lee::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/110096/original/image-20160203-28574-vitsfl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C923%2C5184%2C2514&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

What Are Crypto OTC Desks? How Do Cryptocurrency OTC Desks Work? Why Are OTC Desks Important in Crypto? Pros and Cons of Using OTC Desks in Crypto The Bottom Line::Crypto OTC desks play an important role in facilitating large cryptocurrency purchases and sales. Read on to learn what crypto OTC desks are, how they work, and why they play an essential role in the global crypto markets. This is partner content sourced from Laura Shin’s Unchained and published by CoinDesk. Over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks facilitate trading between two parties without revealing information about the trade to the public via an exchange orderbook or otherwise. The OTC desk acts as a matchmaker enabling high-volume transactions between buyers and sellers. During an OTC trade, the two parties agree on a purchase price before they can complete the transaction. The trades can be crypto-to-crypto or fiat-to-crypto. OTC desks differ from traditional exchanges in terms of transaction transparency. A crypto exchange like Kraken or Binance acts as an intermediary between buyers and sellers. Transactions are executed via an orderbook for everyone to see. Conversely, crypto OTC trading is relatively opaque since no one beyond the transacting parties is aware of the price and volume of assets being traded. Moreover, OTC trades are typically insulated from wider market fluctuations that occur on exchanges. There are two types of OTC desks: principal and agency. Principal desks assume the risk to the buyer by using their funds to purchase whatever asset the buyer requires. For instance, a bitcoin whale looking to make a large bitcoin purchase will request a quote from the OTC desk, and they will respond with a price based on prevailing market conditions. The buyer can choose to accept the offer or make a reasonable counter. Should the buyer accept the proposed price, the OTC desk is responsible for sourcing and delivering the BTC to the buyer as per the legal contract signed beforehand. Agency desks, on the other hand, don’t assume the market risk since they don’t put up their own money for transactions. Instead, they act as an intermediary to broker a deal on behalf of the buyer. They will charge a brokerage fee for this service. Crypto OTC desks exist to enable large investors, such as early adopters, high-net-worth individuals, and institutional investors, to buy and sell large amounts of cryptocurrencies without alerting the market about their intention or transaction. If you try to buy 1,000 BTC on a regular crypto exchange, you will run into several problems. A key challenge is that the chances of finding someone selling that amount at any given time on a single exchange are slim. You will have to opt to spread the purchases across several sellers. The problem that arises is you may end up making some of the purchases at a significantly higher price. Of course, you may be able to avoid this altogether and spread the purchase across several exchanges, but this will be time-consuming and costly. Moreover, you will show the entire market that you are a large buyer or seller, which will most likely lead to a worse execution price. Crypto OTC desks remove the uncertainty and risk for investors looking to buy or sell large volumes of crypto. Here are some of the benefits and challenges of using crypto OTC desks. Large crypto investors looking to buy and sell substantial volumes of cryptocurrency prefer the crypto OTC market over trading on crypto exchanges. Most whales keep their transactions off exchange order books to avoid the market moving against them when they want to transact.

Bitcoin [BTC] network fees have fallen to a record low as the Layer 1 (L1) transaction volume continues to decline. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), on-chain data provider IntoTheBlock noted that transaction fees on the Bitcoin network plunged to their lowest level in three months this week. Recording a weekly transaction fee totaling $12 million, the network saw a 45% decline from the previous week.  This week’s decline in the Bitcoin network’s fee is due to the decrease in its transaction volume. According to Santiment’s data, the aggregate amount of BTC across all transactions completed on the network fell steadily during the week. Between the 11th and the 17th of May, Bitcoin’s transaction volume plummeted by 5%. Source: Santiment The average fee paid per transaction dropped as the network saw a decline in demand. According to Messari, this decreased by 17% during the period under review. At press time, the average cost of executing a transaction on the Bitcoin network was $2.56. The miners on Bitcoin’s network are the primary victims of its low network fees. After the percentage of miner revenue derived from transaction fees rallied to a year-to-date high of 75% on the 20th of April, post-halving event, it has since declined significantly. Source: Messari As of this writing, only 4% of miner revenue is derived from the fees paid by Bitcoin’s users. This marked a 95% decline from the YTD high, per Messari’s data. Low revenue and BTC’s recent price troubles have forced some miners to sell their holdings. AMBCrypto assessed Bitcoin’s Miner Supply Ratio and found that it has fallen by 0.21% since the halving event. This metric measures miners’ BTC holdings relative to the coin’s total supply. When it declines this way, miners are selling a larger portion of their mined coins. This is often due to capitulation from high operational costs, the desire to take profit, or a lack of confidence in the coin’s price. Is your portfolio green?

Yet, developers looking to Ethereum to build usable web3 resources do not simply start building on the mainnet. Instead, they rely first on testnets. This guide discusses one popular testnet, Rinkeby. Read on to learn about this vital Ethereum test network. Testnets are used to support test transactions. Developers user testnets to try out implementations that use frameworks such as Truffle and the Solidity programming language. This allows DApps to be tested and improved without developers encountering the financial burden and risks associated with the main Ethereum blockchain. Rinkeby is one such testnet. Even though the Rinkeby testnet and Rinkeby faucet were deprecated as of 2024, assessing their role in facilitating robust DApp development can help both new and advanced developers better understand Ethereum test networks. The Rinkeby testnet for Ethereum DApp testing came into existence in 2017. It focused specifically on smart contract testing and quickly became vital to the Ethereum development environment. Rinkeby operated as a proof-of-authority (PoA) testnet at a time when Ethereum itself was proof-of-work (PoW), as was Ropsten, one of the other popular testnets. BREAKING: Ethereum's testnet Ropsten successfully transitions to PoS Over the years, the Rinkeby network emerged as a particularly stable option. The network offered something similar to a “Controlled Node Validation” environment and supported predictable testing scenarios. The Rinkeby testnet community quickly became one of the most active, offering reliable and quick feedback on smart contract execution. Meanwhile, the PoA consensus ensured the testnet became one of the best for developers looking to continuously test setups and integrations. Did you know? Controlled Node Validation, in the case of Rinkeby testnet, refers to a system where only a limited number of entities (trusted) are allowed to confirm and validate transactions. Rinkeby was one of the more popular Ethereum test networks used to quickly test smart contracts and DApps. The Rinkeby testnet was a controlled sandbox-like environment replicating the Ethereum blockchain environment. Developers could deploy applications on this testnet before introducing them to the mainnet. As for the testnet gas fees, some faucets gave out made-up ETH or “test” ETH. Rinkeby Faucet was one such test ETH tap, associated specifically with the Rinkeby testnet. Trusted node operation was another technical aspect of the now-defunct Rinkeby testnet. Just like the mainnet, where validators have both block-creation and transaction-confirming power, in the case of Rinkeby, this was handled by trusted entities or individuals operating the nodes. As mentioned previously, the Rinkeby faucet employed the PoA consensus mechanism, which supports faster transactions and, therefore, quicker tests. Only validated accounts approve the blocks and transactions, which made the testnet more secure than other options. As PoA facilitates speed and efficiency, Rinkeby became an obvious choice for developers looking for quick iterations and feedback. When active, Rinkeby was extensively compared to the likes of Kovan and Ropsten. Kovan followed the same PoA consensus as Rinkeby. However, Rinkeby was more popular as it was supported by Geth, Ethereum’s most popular client. Ropsten resembled Ethereum closely as it was a PoW testnet, much like Ethereum before 2022. However, Ropsten often encountered issues due to spamming and forking, making Rinkeby all the more popular. New testnets surfaced for Ethereum since the merge. Kiln (now also deprecated) was one example. Kiln, the next iteration of Ethereum merge testnets, is now live 🔥🧱 Highly recommended that node operators, application developers, stakers, tooling/infra providers test their setups on the network. Blog post has all the info to get started 😁https://t.co/TCHBZxcFlt Simply put, the Rinkeby faucet is like a tap that distributes test ETH, allowing developers to test DApps repeatedly without worrying about gas fees. The Rinkeby faucet provides test ETH when you connect your Ethereum wallet address or MetaMask wallet address to the faucet website. Once done, you can redirect the faucet tokens to your MetaMask address, provided you have selected the testnet network. Even though Rinkeby isn’t available in 2024, you can try this process with Sepolia. In some cases, testnet ETH caps are used to avoid network abuse. “Testnets help three distinct groups of users: client developers, application developers and node operators/stakers/miners, but, the needs of each of these are quite different!” Notably, with faucets like Rinkeby’s, the DApp and DeFi development cycle becomes cost-effective. This is because developers have time to perfect their resources before launching them on the mainnet. Here are a few specific Rinkeby testnet features that made it different from other faucets: Rinkeby transactions were publicly available, like Ethereum, via a dedicated explorer. This tool, termed Rinkeby Etherscan, was useful for the following tasks: Now that the Rinkeby testnet is no longer available, users can only access Rinkeby Etherscan as an archived tool. The Arbiscan Rinkeby Testnet explorer by @etherscan is now live! 🎊 Navigate through all of your activity on our testnet with this beautiful new explorer! 🔎 👉 https://t.co/XM1HeoZ1Gw pic.twitter.com/1gE4h7lLLV Clarity around node setup and maintenance of the popular testnet should help set up and maintain future iterations. Here are the things you should note about the Rinkeby testnet: Here is a quick table comparing the Rinkeby testnet with some of the other popular names (all deprecated): The Rinkeby testnet and faucet are no longer active. While the Ethereum Foundation discontinued their use in 2023, the testnet and faucet were officially deprecated on June 15, 2022. Here’s why: BREAKING: #Ethereum Goerli testnet successfully merges to proof-of-stake. With Rinkeby out of the equation, Sepolia is the only Ethereum test network in play in 2024. This testnet serves as a reliable alternative, thanks to its PoS consensus. This precisely checks security enhancements, validator performance, and staking. While the Rinkeby Ethereum network and the Rinkeby faucet are no longer active, the importance of testnets in the Ethereum development environment cannot be overstated. From launching a cryptocurrency on Ethereum to exploring innovative DeFi use cases or DApp testing, testnets are lifelines for developers and crucial to successful blockchain development. You cannot use the Rinkeby Ethereum network anymore in 2024. However, when it was active, it was used for Ethereum DApp testing, smart contract testing, and for other use cases across the Ethereum development environment. A testnet faucet like the Rinkeby faucet is a tool or service distributing free test cryptocurrency, including test ETH to the testnet users. The faucet for testing Ether is takes care of the testnet gas fees for developers interested in Ethereum test transactions. ETH is the actual cryptocurrency specific to the Ethereum blockchain. Goerli ETH, on the other hand, is the testnet faucet ETH that doesn’t have any real-world value and is simply made-up Ethereum. However, Goerli ETH once traded at a premium due to massive demand, an issue that was combatted using testnet caps. A testnet is meant for testing real DApps before they are deployed to the mainnet. For instance, developers indulging in Rinkeby testnet deployment focused on testing smart contracts and DApps on the Rinkeby Ethereum network first, using testnet gas fees to check stability, security posture, and other aspects.

149::https://blockworks.co/news/future-tokenization-permissioned-blockchains::Blockworks::article::The future of tokenization? Permissioned blockchains::Opinion: Despite BlackRock’s fund on Ethereum, the future of tokenization is really with permissioned blockchains.::At least for the near future, the majority of institutional tokenization will take place on closed, permissioned networks Artwork by Crystal Le Many interpret BlackRock pouring $100 million into Ethereum as a sign that institutional tokenization will finally take off on public, permissionless networks. It will — but BlackRock’s tokenized fund is only melting the tip of a Titanic-sized iceberg. The crypto industry has cried wolf about institutions coming many times. By this point, we definitely know they’re interested in tokenization. The big players — BNP Paribas, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, the Hong Kong government, Franklin Templeton, Hamilton Lane and now BlackRock — have already been exploring blockchain technology for a while. It’s certainly a watershed moment when the world’s largest asset manager opts for a public chain over a private platform like JPMorgan’s Onyx or Goldman Sach’s solution. BlackRock’s tokenized fund on Ethereum signals institutional trust in a public, permissionless network, bringing much-needed legitimacy to the nascent public ecosystem. The move will also encourage other traditional institutional players to transition to on-chain funds. But while BlackRock’s tokenization on Ethereum was a bold move worthy of the headlines it made, the reality is tokenization is predominantly taking place on private, permissioned blockchains. To date, the majority of institutional efforts have involved private networks. The Hong Kong government’s $100 million tokenized green bond used GS DAP, deployed on the privacy-enabled blockchain Canton. Goldman Sachs, BNY Mellon, Cboe Global Markets and other firms recently wrapped up a series of pilots on the same network. HSBC has used its platform, the Orion digital assets platform, to tokenize gold for everyday investors in Hong Kong. And BlackRock has used the private Tokenized Collateral Network on JPMorgan’s Ethereum-based Onyx to tokenize shares in one of its money market funds. Read more from our opinion section: Fintech has hit a wall. Blockchain will break through it. Bitcoin proved that a multi-billion dollar market can essentially come out of thin air. The industry believed that everything could be tokenized and traded via blockchain and enjoy increased liquidity. However, the glittering promise of liquidity for real-world assets has (so far) proven a mirage. The initial token boom of 2018 hyped trillions of dollars in tokenized assets on public networks. Almost seven years later, there are only a few billions of dollars in total assets under management on public networks — a tiny piece of what’s theoretically possible. Meanwhile, private networks are moving billions of dollars in daily transactions. The crypto industry loves to float the $16 trillion in illiquid assets Boston Consulting Group projects to be tokenized by 2030. Even the more conservative estimate — McKinsey & Company’s $5 trillion in tokenized real-world assets — is huge. If we look at the trends and what’s happening, though, it’s clear that a majority of these assets will first be tokenized on private networks. Unlike crypto — which is an entirely new asset class existing within open ecosystems — real-world assets inherit the legacy of traditional finance. This legacy favors control over assets and customers, closed ecosystems and compatibility with traditional markets — a direct contrast with the ethos of public, permissionless networks. This explains why financial institutions favor private networks. Private networks operate closer to the existing financial infrastructure and can facilitate easier compliance. These networks are more capable of meeting business needs, as they provide flexibility in governance and customization, like modifications to the blockchain’s consensus protocol, transaction validation rules and permissions. These networks can also handle higher transaction volumes, which is essential for scalability. There’s also the issue of regulation. It’s only in the past couple of years that regulators have begun to pass and enact comprehensive frameworks guiding involvement in crypto assets. As a result, public blockchain technology has felt untouchable until recently to these institutions, for whom compliance is paramount. For securities, there is at least some clarity. Tokenized securities are still securities and must operate within the existing regulatory framework. However, some assets — like real estate — which are not necessarily securities off chain will be considered securities once tokenized. The industry is still figuring out what it would take for these assets to meet existing requirements. Today, nobody doubts the benefits of blockchain technology. The issue for traditional finance is mostly one of integration and technology costs, infrastructure compatibility and regulatory concerns. While public networks offer more transparency, immutability and decentralization, private networks are more practical and familiar for financial institutions. There are also a few technology issues to sort out. Let’s use BlackRock’s chosen Ethereum as an example. While Ethereum has made progress with initiatives like layer-2 solutions and the Merge to Ethereum 2.0, the network faces challenges meeting the demand for speed, privacy and compliance necessary for transactions involving regulated institutions. As the technology matures and regulatory frameworks evolve, we can expect to see more tokenization migrating to public blockchains and a new wave of innovation. However, at least for the near future, the majority of institutional tokenization will take place on closed, permissioned networks.

151::https://cryptobriefing.com/us-bitcoin-etf-inflows-2/::Crypto Briefing::article::Bitcoin ETFs show $1.3 billion inflows and bounce back from April's slump::Bitcoin ETFs in US now manage over $12.3 billion, despite regulatory challenges. Regulatory movements::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US registered $1.3 billion in inflows over the past two weeks, shared Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas on X. This was enough to recover completely from April’s net outflows of over $343 million. The Bitcoin ETFs traded in the US now hold more than $12.3 billion under management, which Balchunas considers a key number for considering inflows and outflows. The bitcoin ETFs have put together a solid two weeks with $1.3b in inflows, which offsets the entirety of the negative flows in April- putting them back around high water mark of +$12.3b net since launch. This key number IMO bc it nets out inflows and outflows (which are normal) pic.twitter.com/tdnZOKEocM — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) May 17, 2024 Moreover, Balchunas highlighted that those numbers make a point of not getting “emotional” over Bitcoin ETF flows, sharing his belief that the net flows will turn out as positive in the long term and that the flow amounts are relatively small when compared to the total under management. As reported by Crypto Briefing, professional investment firms showed a high interest in Bitcoin ETFs in the first quarter, with 937 of them reporting exposure to those investment instruments in their 13F Forms. Balchunas doubled down on that, highlighting that BlackRock’s IBIT got 414 reported holders in Q1. He adds that having 20 holders for a recently launched ETF is “highly rare,” showing that at least four Bitcoin funds surpassed that mark with ease. In the last 24 hours, nine Bitcoin ETFs in the US added 3,743 BTC to their holdings, as reported by X user Lookonchain, which is equivalent to over $250 million. Grayscale’s GBTC added 397 BTC, while BlackRock’s IBIT added 1,435 BTC. Galaxy’s BTCO was the only Bitcoin ETF showing daily net outflows, with 543 BTC leaving their chest. Furthermore, recent regulatory developments in the US could heat up even more the Bitcoin ETF landscape. Yesterday, the Senate passed a vote to overturn the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121), which makes it more expensive for banks to hold digital assets for their customers. However, US President Joe Biden has already manifested himself contrary to the bill, and a presidential veto is very likely.

152::https://theconversation.com/are-nfts-really-dead-and-buried-all-signs-point-to-yes-214145::The Conversation::article::Are NFTs really dead and buried? All signs point to ‘yes’::This is why no one is buying your cartoon ape.::Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are in dire straits. With the market in a severe downturn, it’s safe to assume the NFT bubble has well and truly burst. It was never clear why these digital collectables traded for such large amounts of money. Now they mostly do not. What’s behind their turn of fate? And is there any hope for their future? Non-fungible tokens are a blockchain-based means to claim unique “ownership” of digital assets. “Non-fungible” means unique, as opposed to a “fungible” item such as a five-dollar bill, which is the same as every other five-dollar bill. But just because an item is unique that doesn’t make it valuable. Digital assets are easily copied, so an NFT is essentially a receipt showing you have paid for something that other people can get for free. This is a pretty dubious basis for value. The two most traded sets of NFTs are the Bored Apes collection created in April 2021 and the CryptoPunks collection launched in June 2017. Both sets consist of 10,000 similar-looking but unique figures, distinguished by differing hairstyles, hats, skin colours and so forth. The Bored Ape character seems derivative of the drawings of Jamie Hewlett, the artist who drew Tank Girl and Damon Albarn’s virtual band Gorillaz. The CryptoPunks are even less interesting. Although the first NFTs emerged around a decade ago, the trend really started to take off in 2021. And for a time NFTs were very fashionable. Even the venerable auction house Sotheby’s, founded in 1744, jumped on the NFT bandwagon. Sotheby’s sold 101 Bored Ape NFTs for more than US$20 million in September 2021. They’re now facing a lawsuit from a disgruntled buyer. As with Bitcoin and similar speculative tokens, the primary driver for buying NFTs was greed. Seeing the initial price rises, people hoped they too could make huge profits. NFTs are essentially a superficially sophisticated form of gambling. Like Bitcoin, they have no fundamental value. Read more: NFTs, an overblown speculative bubble inflated by pop culture and crypto mania Generally, one would only profit from buying an NFT by finding a “greater fool” willing to pay even more for it. So there was never a shortage of people – including some quite famous ones – talking them up and hoping to instil a fear of missing out. Eminem bought a Bored Ape that looked a bit like him. Rapper KSI boasted on Twitter about his Bored Ape rising in price. For a while there were large increases in the prices of many NFTs. But like all speculative bubbles, it was likely to end in tears. Although it’s almost impossible to predict when a bubble for a speculative asset will burst, we have seen this process play out before. Centuries ago there were the Dutch tulip, South Sea and Mississippi bubbles. Around 1970, there was a speculative bubble in the shares of nickel miner Poseidon. Then came the Beanie Baby and dotcom booms of the late 1990s – and more recently, meme stocks and Terra-Luna cryptocurrency. Punters now seem to be as bored with NFTs as the apes. Google searches for “NFT” – which grew rapidly through 2021 – have fallen away dramatically. Trading volumes have collapsed. Prices in the NFT market have also seen huge falls. The prices of Bored Ape NFTs are down about 90% from their peak. The CryptoPunks have done slightly better by losing only 80%. A recent report covering about 73,000 NFTs estimated 70,000 are now valued at zero. This leaves 23 million people holding a worthless “asset”. One high-profile example is an NFT of the first tweet by then-Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Crypto entrepreneur Sina Estavi bought this NFT for US$2.9 million in March 2021. When he tried to sell it a year later the top bid was US$6,800. What drove the NFT collapse? As well as losing their novelty, the market was hurt by the large falls in the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency, as well as the collapse of the FTX exchange and publicity given to scams. Beyond that, the lifting of COVID lockdowns meant people who began trading NFTs now had other ways to pass their time. And higher interest rates from mid-2022 made most speculative assets seem less attractive. Collectively, all of these factors made NFTs seem like a riskier proposition. Prominent people started jumping off the bandwagon. Some of KSI’s later tweets lament the losses he suffered from his gambles.  Last year, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced, when he was chancellor of the exchequer (their equivalent of treasurer), the Royal Mint would produce an NFT. The plan has now been abandoned. Some foolish people had even taken out loans using the “value” of their NFTs as collateral. When the lenders wanted the money back, they were in trouble: forced to sell their NFTs, they got back much less than they’d paid.

But unless some actual use is found for them, NFTs are likely to fade further from public discussion, with their prices increasingly trending down (although the occasional blip up may give die-hard fans some hope).

153::https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/08/microstrategy-should-continue-to-rally-as-bitcoin-halving-nears-benchmark/::CoinDesk::article::MicroStrategy Should Continue to Rally as Bitcoin Halving Nears: Benchmark::The broker raised its price target for the software company to $1,875 from $990 and maintained its buy rating on the stock.::MicroStrategy (MSTR) is particularly well positioned to benefit from the bitcoin (BTC) halving set to occur around April 20, when new supply of the cryptocurrency will be cut by 50%, broker Benchmark said in a research report on Monday. “We note that the three previous bitcoin halvings, in 2012, 2016, and 2020, saw explosive appreciation in bitcoin’s price occur only after the halving had taken place,” analyst Mark Palmer wrote. The quadrennial halving is when miner rewards are reduced, slowing the rate of growth in bitcoin supply. Benchmark raised its MicroStrategy price target to $1,875 from $990 while maintaining its buy rating. The new price target is based on the assumption that bitcoin will reach $150,000 by the end of 2025, up from $125,000 previously. MicroStrategy shares rose more than 11% to around $1,601 in trading before the official open of U.S. markets. “While the upcoming bitcoin halving will create a supply shock as the previous ones had, we believe the event’s impact could be magnified by the concurrent demand shock created by the emergence of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs),” Palmer wrote, adding that “we expect inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs to grow dramatically once institutions begin to invest in them in earnest.” MicroStrategy has a unique business model based on the acquisition and holding of bitcoin. The company is expected to continue to add to its bitcoin stash using proceeds from capital markets transactions and excess cash generated by its enterprise software business, the report said. Benchmark estimates that the company will hold 298,246 bitcoins by year-end 2025, up from the 214,246 coins it owned as of March 19. Rival broker BTIG said the software developer’s implied premium to bitcoin is supported by investors who want exposure to digital assets but may be unable to invest directly in the cryptocurrency or ETFs, and also supported by the company’s ability to accretively raise capital to purchase additional BTC, it wrote in a report on Friday.

To learn more on how we evaluate each piece of content, please proceed to our verification methodology page Charles Hoskinson is a prolific figure in the cryptocurrency industry. He’s among the original Ethereum co-founders, having worked alongside Vitalik Buterin and others to build Ethereum. Hoskinson also briefly served as the Ethereum CEO before a fallout that saw him leave the Ethereum network to build Cardano, a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain. Read on to learn who Charles Hoskinson is, what he does, why he is important, and some of the challenges he has experienced. Charles Hoskinson is an American mathematician and tech entrepreneur in the web3 space. He was born in Hawaii, USA, in 1987 to a family of doctors. Hoskinson initially toyed with following in his parents’ footsteps to study medicine. However, he later chartered his path and instead chose to study mathematics. Charles Hoskinson began his academic journey at the Metropolitan State University of Denver, where he earned a degree in analytic number theory. He then enrolled for a Master’s in Mathematics at the University of Colorado Boulder. Hoskinson later enrolled for his PhD but dropped out before he could graduate and joined Ron Paul’s 2008 presidential campaign. Paul’s libertarian views fueled Hoskinson’s decision to join his campaign. Hoskinson was fascinated by Austrian economics and monetary theory, which argued that an economic system founded on fiat currency is essentially unstable, worked. Something that Bitcoin, the first digital currency, attempted to address. Given that the crypto market is volatile, it’s difficult to get the exact net worth of prolific figures in the space, including Hoskinson. This is because his net worth is directly connected to his crypto holdings, and a large chunk of it is linked to the value of the ADA coin. However, most estimates have placed his net worth somewhere between $500 and $600 million. Still, this is subject to change based on Cardano’s price action and the future ADA price. Hoskinsom has founded and co-founded three crypto-related companies: Ethereum, IOHK, and Invictus Innovations. Charles is among the eight co-founders of the Ethereum network and the founder and CEO of Cardano. He has also held various positions in both the private and public sectors. Charles Hoskinson was also the founding chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation’s education committee and helped establish the Cryptocurrency Research Group in 2013. Well-revered within the crypto community, Hoskinson has built projects to educate people about blockchain technology and decentralized assets. He co-founded BitShares, an early crypto-decentralized exchange (DEX) platform. As the Cardano founder, Hoskinson continues to lead the design, development, and research of the Cardano blockchain and ADA cryptocurrency. Besides being a tech entrepreneur and founding several crypto-related entities, Charles Hoskinson is also a philanthropist. In 2020, Hoskinson’s company, IOHK, donated $500,000 in ADA cryptocurrency to the University of Wyoming and established a Cardano Research Lab to advance the research and development of blockchain technology. In 2021, he donated $20 million to Carnegie Mellon University to build a center for mathematics named Hoskinson Center for Formal Mathematics. According to the university’s website, “the center is dedicated to using formal computational methods and new technologies for mathematical research and education.” In 2022, IOHK donated $4.5 million to the research hub at the University of Edinburgh to fund research on new projects that would advance blockchain development. Did you know? Charles Hoskinson’s IOHK rebranded to Input Output Global (IOG) in 2021 after moving its headquarters from Hong Kong, China, to Wyoming, U.S. With over 900,000 followers on X (formerly Twitter), Charles Hoskinson is a mathematician and crypto entrepreneur primarily known for creating Cardano, a proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol. The Cardano blockchain has its own native crypto, ADA, which has a maximum supply of 45 billion coins. Hoskinson is also the CEO of IOHK, a company he founded in 2015 alongside Jeremy Wood. IOHK markets itself as “one of the world’s pre-eminent blockchain infrastructure research and engineering companies.” He is also one of Ethereum’s co-founders. Ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency globally in terms of market capitalization. He also had a brief stint as the CEO of the Ethereum network. Before Hoskinson joined the crypto community as an entrepreneur, he was one of the presidential campaign for Ron Paul in 2008. He then went ahead to work at a consultancy firm. Hoskinson also stated that he briefly worked at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), even though the institute has never formally acknowledged or refuted his claims. He was also the founding chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation’s education committee and helped to create the Cryptocurrency Research Group. Charles Hoskinson has made significant contributions to the cryptocurrency and blockchain technology industry. As explained in previous sections, he was part of the founding team that created the framework and vision for the Ethereum network. He also helped build Ethereum’s highly successful initial coin offering (ICO). Besides Ethereum, Hoskinson also built the Cardano blockchain and the ADA coin, a leading altcoin in the crypto asset market. Cardano is a next-generation blockchain network, smart contract platform, and digital currency built for scale and speed, and it is more secure than older blockchains. It’s also home to thousands of decentralized applications (DApps). He also created the ADA cryptocurrency that powers the Cardano ecosystem. The ADA coin has several uses, including paying transaction fees on the network and sending and receiving payments. Moreover, ADA holders can also stake Cardano to validate transactions and secure the network. It also almost always ranks among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Before Cardano existed, Hoskinson was involved in developing the Ethereum network. In 2013, Anthony Di Lorio, another of Ethereum’s co-founders and fellow Bitcoin enthusiast, introduced Hoskinson to the Ethereum whitepaper. Hoskinson became intrigued and began attending early Ethereum meetings. He would later join the team and become one of the network’s founders. While it isn’t entirely clear what his exact role was in creating Ethereum, he was, nevertheless, pivotal for the network’s success. Hoskinson helped develop Ethereum’s first ICO and was also part of the decision-makers who decided to register the Ethereum Foundation in Switzerland. Trouble began when part of the team wanted Ethereum to take a non-profit approach. Hoskinson, on the other hand, wanted Ethereum to be a for-profit project. Some of the developers, including Vitalik, disagreed with this. Hoskinson also disagreed with the approach of having the Ethereum network use the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which made it less environmentally friendly than blockchains with PoS-based consensus protocols. Following these disagreements, Hoskinson left Ethereum and took a six-month sabbatical. He briefly toyed with the idea of going back to mathematics before Jeremy Wood, another Ethereum co-founder approached him with the idea of establishing an engineering and research firm that would develop blockchains and digital currencies for academic institutions, corporations, and government entities. The company was named Input Output Hong Kong, or IOHK. Hoskinson would later suggest developing a “Japanese version of Ethereum” for a client. In 2017, Hoskinson built and launched Cardano, an open-source, decentralized, intelligent contract protocol initially focused on the Japanese market. It would later expand its operations globally. So far, Cardano has been the most noteworthy project developed by IOHK. Cardano is Charles Hoskinson’s most prestigious and popular web3 venture. He began developing the PoS blockchain in 2015 with the help of Wood. The project was created to be everything that he wanted Ethereum to be but wasn’t at the time. The vision behind Cardano was to improve on the functionality that was initially missing in Ethereum. Hoskinson, therefore, developed Cardano with an efficient and environmentally friendly consensus mechanism, the proof-of-stake protocol. This was so that it could be more efficient than older blockchains that relied on the proof-of-work mechanism. Moreover, Hoskinson also wanted a protocol that could address the major problems facing other blockchains, such as decentralization, scalability, security, and smart contract functionality. He wanted Cardano to be more flexible, scalable, and secure than Bitcoin and Ethereum. Hoskinson also envisioned a blockchain network that would advance into a network for decentralized applications with numerous use cases governed by stakers. Cardano has over 1,000 projects developing web3 decentralized applications on its platform today. The protocol’s native coin, ADA, is named after the Countess of Lovelace, Augusta Ada King, who was the first computer programmer. Users can trade ADA from most crypto wallets and exchanges like other cryptocurrencies. IOHK was established in 2015 by Charles Hoskinson and Jeremy Wood. IOHK is a leading research and engineering company in the blockchain space. IOHK aims to develop blockchain projects for academic institutions and companies in the private and public sectors. Its most significant blockchain project is Cardano, a leading smart contract platform. Hoskinson got the idea to develop Cardano after a client proposed building a “Japanese version of Ethereum.” However, he was motivated to build Cardano as an improved version of first (Bitcoin) and second-generation (Ethereum) blockchains. He wanted Cardano to address the limitations he perceived Bitcoin and Ethereum lacked, including scalability and security issues. The Cardano blockchain differs from other blockchains through its diligent peer-reviewed research foundation that aims to create a more interoperable, scalable, and secure blockchain network. Utilizing the PoS consensus mechanism means that Cardano is energy-efficient and sustainable. In addition, he wanted to create a protocol that was accessible and useful to billions of people, especially the unbanked, across various populations worldwide. As a passionate public speaker and advocate for blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, Charles Hoskinson has faced a few challenges. Users have accused Hoskinson of having too much control over the decision-making process at Cardano. Moreover, Cardano’s roadmap has also been criticized for being too long and slow to progress. There was also a controversy with Laura Shin, a journalist and author, who criticized Hoskinson for his contribution to the blockchain and crypto space. In February 2022, Laura Shin, a crypto journalist, Unchained podcast host, and author of The Cryptopians, suggested in her book that Charles Hoskinson never finished his undergraduate degree or enrolled in a PhD program. The controversy started on X (formerly Twitter) when a user tweeted that they were reading Shin’s book and were fascinated by Hoskinson’s early years in crypto. Hoskinson responded to the tweet, calling Shin’s book a “great work of fiction.”  Not one to take it lying down, Shin responded to Hoskinson’s tweet asking him to address the discrepancies in his claims of having dropped out of his PhD program despite the school stating that he had only enrolled for his undergraduate degree. Shin stated that she had thoroughly researched her book and had even contacted both universities that Hoskinson claimed he attended. In her book, Shin noted that the Metropolitan State University of Denver didn’t have a graduate math program. She asserted that both universities stated that Hoskinson enrolled and studied as an undergraduate but didn’t graduate from either university. Shin also wrote in her book that Hoskinson’s claims that he worked at DARPA were false. In her tweets to the Cardano founder, Shin also tweeted that she had given Hoskinson and his team ample time to talk to her and offer their perspective, but they never did. It, therefore, remains unclear whether Hoskinson earned an undergrad and master’s degree from the two universities. Hoskinson has been quite vocal about his approach, thoughts, and views on cryptocurrencies and the blockchain. He has in the past shared his views regarding the purpose of digital currencies on X, stating that: “Crypto doesn’t want to set the world on fire; it just wants to start a flame in your heart.” Through his company, IOHK, he has funded various blockchain technology research labs globally to boost blockchain and crypto adoption. He has also shared his thoughts on the high energy that older blockchains such as Bitcoin consume. He believes that blockchain technology is the future and that it’ll help the world become a more inclusive and better place. Charles Hoskinson has significantly contributed to the crypto sector since he started in 2013. He was part of the team that created the Ethereum network before he left to establish Cardano. Through IOHK, Hoskinson hopes to educate and provide financial services to the three billion people worldwide who lack an equitable and transparent financial system. Charles Hoskinson created Cardano as a decentralized, smart contract platform that was much more flexible, scalable, and secure than other blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Charles Hoskinson is currently the founder and CEO of IOHK. He is also the founder of Cardano and continues to lead the design, development, and research of the Cardano blockchain and ADA cryptocurrency. He is also a public speaker and advocate for blockchain and crypto. Charles Hoskinson is the founder of Cardano. He developed the Cardano network, a proof-of-stake blockchain, after discussions with a client who proposed that they build a “Japanese version of Ethereum” in 2015. Cardano is famous as the first blockchain to evolve from cryptographic and scientific peer-review research methods. The blockchain was also designed to be energy-efficient and provide an open-source platform to offer people accessible economic services by hosting decentralized applications. Cardano is special because it is a sustainable, environmentally friendly blockchain. This is thanks to using the PoS consensus mechanism, Ouroboros, instead of the energy-intensive PoW system used by blockchains like Bitcoin. Cardano uses the PoS consensus mechanism and follows a systematic and more formal method. It employs peer review and academic research in its design and implementation. In addition, several entities, including the Cardano Foundation, Emurgo, IOHK, and its treasury system, are involved in the protocol’s decision-making. Cardano utilizes a layered architecture, which separates the protocol’s settlement layer (Cardano Settlement Layer, CSL) from the platform’s computation layer (Cardano Computation Layer, CCL). This division enables Cardano to enjoy greater scalability and flexibility. Charles Hoskinson established The Bitcoin Education Project, which offered free, peer-reviewed content on cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Hoskinson’s goal with the project was to lower the cryptocurrency knowledge barrier and educate one million users by 2014. The project saw him secure partnerships with Bitcoin Magazine and Udemy. Over the years, the Cardano blockchain has contributed to global blockchain adoption by offering a platform that’s easily accessible for users to build DApps on. Moreover, The Cardano Foundation is actively working to drive the widespread adoption of the platform to academic institutions, businesses, and organizations.

157::https://cryptobriefing.com/franklin-templeton-blockchain-cost-savings-tokenization/::Crypto Briefing::article::Franklin Templeton CEO: Blockchain offers major cost savings for tokenization::Jenny Johnson thinks blockchain is “a very efficient technology.” Data is the next oil::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson, speaking at the 27th Annual Milken Institute Global Conference in California, praised blockchain’s efficiency and cost reduction in asset tokenization and shared her thoughts on the benefits of generative AI. Johnson stated that the company ran a parallel experiment for six to eight months, processing account records using both traditional and blockchain methods. The results showed that blockchain was more cost-effective and produced fewer errors. “We used to run our own in-house, one of the few firms that did. And the one that we built on blockchain. So these are the records of the shareholders and we parallel process for a period of 6 to 8 months,” Johnson said. “And we were astonished by how much less, how much cost it was to run a blockchain. It’s a very effective technology, and we think it is going to open up a lot of new investment opportunities,” she emphasized. Johnson predicts that all ETFs and mutual funds could eventually transition to blockchain technology. She believes this shift would lead to significant cost savings due to the elimination of data verification between different systems on the blockchain. “Eventually, I think exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds are all going to be on blockchain,” Johnson stated. “In the case of blockchain, there’s only one source of trust. That transaction happens, everybody has the source of trust, and so that drives out a lot of costs. And when you can drive out the friction in transactions, you can start to invest in new areas,” she explained. Franklin Templeton is behind one of the world’s leading equity tokenized funds, the Franklin OnChain US Government Money Fund (FOBXX), represented by the BENJI token. As of May 12, the BENJI token had a market capitalization of $368 million, according to Dune Analytics. In addition to tokenization, Johnson also discussed the role of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in assisting asset managers to better meet customers’ needs. According to her, “data is the next oil next year.” She believes that large asset managers will have an edge in the AI race because these firms have much proprietary data to analyze and train AI models. Johnson said Franklin Templeton has introduced an AI bot to their help desk to assist with handling inquiries, and the bot is capable of handling 60% of queries. However, the real potential is “a model that’s leveraging a bunch of different AI,” she noted. She believes these advancements could pave the way for highly personalized investment strategies.

158::https://theconversation.com/rise-of-cryptocurrencies-like-bitcoin-begs-question-what-is-money-46713::The Conversation::article::Rise of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin begs question: what is money?::Money used to be backed by something of real value such as gold or silver. Bitcoins and other digital currencies will sever that link forever.::When you begin to delve into the question of what money really is, you must be prepared for some metaphysics. Money, currencies and other such media of exchange differ markedly in their backgrounds and means of operation, and have changed quite recently into forms that are barely understandable. For centuries, minted coins not only represented the value and trust of banks, their depositors and eventually nation-states, but also were deemed valuable because they were made from precious metals like gold and silver. These metals are difficult to move around in large quantities, and so banknotes were invented as early as the seventh century in China and brought to Europe in the 13th century. Unlike coins, banknotes were not treated as valuable in themselves since they were simply printed on otherwise worthless paper. Rather, they served as a form of promissory note or IOU that could be presented to the banks that issued them in exchange for their face value in precious metal, coins or bullion. In the 20th century, most central banks and governments stopped backing up their currencies with precious metals, and yet banknotes maintain fluctuating values, with some in high demand as media for exchange both domestically and internationally. Dollars and euros are highly regarded and preferred currencies for international commerce, as well as for stocking private bank accounts. Now we have bitcoins and other digital currencies that exist entirely in blocks of zeros and ones and are even “mined” by machines running algorithms. And earlier this month, bitcoins and their ilk were officially deemed commodities by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which will now regulate them. So as the greenbacks and quarters in our pockets slowly disappear, replaced by strings of digits stored on our smartphones, and money takes another step away from being tied to anything of value, a philosophical question comes to mind: does money still exist? And if so, what gives it its value? Money is a “fungible” item, which means that exchange of any one portion for a portion of equal value is not a “taking” of property. That is, you don’t own a particular US$100 bill. You own the value it represents. This is how banks have long worked, since when you deposit your money, you are not entitled to receive the same coins or bills back as you deposited. This is also how “fractional reserve” banking began (in which banks do not keep all the curency on deposit “within” the bank, just some fraction of it) and was not regarded somehow as theft. People took their money to a bank, they were given a note of deposit, which entitled them to withdraw the same amount plus some interest, but they were not entitled to the same coins or bills that they deposited. The money on deposit in a bank is not all physically in the bank (excepting that which is in safety deposit boxes) and has not been really since banking was invented. When you deposit a sum, you no longer own the paper or other medium of exchange used for the deposit, legally. What you own is a debt and obligation by the bank to return the equivalent amount of money with interest. John Searle has described things like money as “some special sort” of social objects. That is, X (coins, bills, strings of digits) work as Y (money) in context C (an economy, coffee shop, bank, etc). In the case of money, anything can conceivably take on the Y role even without an X (think a barter economy). Where metals, then bills and now bits in computer memory take the role of X, money might well be a “free-standing” Y, meaning it could exist without anything to represent it except the web of intentional states (the debts and obligations) that make more familiar forms of money function. It’s only physical manifestation might be a note in a ledger. Without precious metal standards backing national currencies, and in the age of digital transactions, money is decreasingly tied to banknotes, just as its ties to metals have faded. Digital ledgers track exchanges and accounts, with digital strings in computer memories representing the trust and value we once attached to more solid things like coins, bills and notes, in more ephemeral digitally encoded, instantly accessible forms attached to cellphones, computers and chip cards. New types of cryptocurrencies (where cryptography protects its integrity) like bitcoin and others take the concept one step further, distributing the banking to all its users, tying the transactions and ledgers to no particular party but to all users at once. This is similar to mirrored bank servers, but bitcoin is mirrored among all bitcoin owners. A bitcoin is as ownable as dollars are when they are deposited in a bank. Skipping the stage of physical, fungible currencies, bitcoins exist by virtue of their representations in a ledger in cyberspace. The information encoded in a massively distributed and constantly updated blockchain is incapable of the exclusivity required for owning objects in the traditional sense. But the same is true of the information that tracks most of the money in the world. Money in nearly every denomination exists and flows in a similar state, represented by digital bits. Bitcoins nonetheless lack some of the institutional guarantees that other types of money has due to nations and their laws. Depositors to banks are protected in their debts by states, generally, and through contracts with their banks. State insurance and the contractual guarantee that a bank will pay back what has been put into them mean that there is some force behind our trust in the continued existence of a person’s wealth while digitally stored in a bank’s servers. The blockchain exists on many servers at once, spread across the universe of bitcoin owners. Without government insurance or contractual guarantees, only mutual trust maintains the value and integrity of the system. What bitcoin owners own is the debt, just as those who own money in banks own debts that are recorded in bits. They do not own the bits that comprise the information representing that debt, nor the information itself, they own the social object – the money – that those bits represent. Bank ledgers exist. They are tangible, even though digital, and they record the debts owed among parties. While cyberspace is ephemeral, it is still real and physically based. Digital bank ledgers now track money without the necessity for physical transfers of currencies. Bitcoins too exist as digital records of obligations, physically encoded on servers of those who hold them, propagated and distributed for transparency and security, encrypted for privacy. Bitcoins are as real as money in banks. What’s most fascinating about these new digital cryptocurrencies is how much they reveal about the surreal nature of currencies and wealth in our digitized economy. If bitcoins are as real as any other money, how real can money be?::2015-09-25T09:20:47Z::Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, Currencies, Money, cashless::David Koepsell::Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/96112/original/image-20150924-17067-1g17suk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C269%2C1500%2C727&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
159::https://www.coindesk.com/sponsored-content/taking-phemex-coos-pulse-after-the-launch-of-phemexpulse/::CoinDesk::article::Taking Phemex COO’s Pulse after the launch of PhemexPulse::N/A::Sponsored Content Phemex has surged over the past year to become one of the world’s leading digital asset exchanges for both spot and futures transactions. It led the way in copy trading, bridged the gap between centralization and decentralization, and most recently, broke new ground with the launch of its revolutionary social trading platform. This innovative platform is crafted to bring the crypto community together, rewarding users for their regular online engagements with tangible benefits. The introduction of PhemexPulse has sparked considerable buzz within the online sphere. CoinDesk reached out to Phemex COO Stella Chan to talk about the inspiration driving the development of PhemexPulse and the strategic moves the company plans to make in fostering dynamic and engaged communities. Thank you for the congratulations! The launch of PhemexPulse has indeed stirred up considerable conversation among crypto enthusiasts. Users have discovered in PhemexPulse a vibrant platform that not only facilitates community engagement but also rewards their participation, creating a unique and interactive experience within the digital asset space. PhemexPulse has become a hub of activity with 160 groups formed by KOLs [key opinion leaders] and content creators in just two weeks. Users love that the platform allows them to continue their usual online activities – like following expert trading tips and engaging in trend discussions with peers – while earning rewards for their participation. And by rewards, we're talking substantial incentives: a daily prize pool of 9,000 PT. [Phemex Tokens, or PT, are the exchange’s native coins.] PT is fundamentally linked to our growing Web3 ecosystem and offers substantial promise for traders. Therefore, we are confident that the prize pool will strongly appeal to our community. The landscape is indeed crowded with social networking platforms that users frequent, particularly during a bull market. PhemexPulse, though, distinguishes itself by not only rewarding users for their consistent online engagement but also by fostering a closer relationship between KOLs and their followers within a conversational environment. It offers a compelling chat-to-earn program for active participation that integrates seamlessly with our Web3 ecosystem. Social trading is gaining significant traction and is expected to be a driving force in the upcoming bull market. While current offerings provide a preview of SocialFi's capabilities, there remains a void for a truly Web3-native social platform that prioritizes community interaction. PhemexPulse fills this niche by delivering an authentic, on-the-ground perspective of the crypto market's pulse through peer discussions and activities. Unlike other social trading platforms that focus solely on incentivizing trading, our approach is to cultivate a spirit of collaboration. We aim to foster grassroots innovation within PhemexPulse through Pulse Groups, where the ideas and contributions of any member can be recognized and developed into projects that benefit from a fair launch process, ensuring a level playing field for all. We understand that KOLs have a variety of platforms to connect with their audience. Yet these platforms often dictate the terms of content creation, while PhemexPulse embraces Web3 principles to return control and ownership to the users. Collaborations and engagements within the PhemexPulse ecosystem directly translate into rewards. Our platform is designed to facilitate community contributions and the accumulation of tokens. For KOLs, monetizing their influence is as straightforward as establishing their own Web3 group on PhemexPulse, with funding from Phemex. By creating a group and fostering dialogue with their followers – through quality content and trading insights – KOLs can earn daily rewards in PT, based on their points accrued. PhemexPulse enables KOLs to excel by leveraging their strengths: leading and engaging with their audience. It removes barriers to community interaction, while Phemex provides the means to convert their influence into tangible PT wealth. We believe this model of engagement, unshackled from the confines of traditional social media and coupled with a reward system intrinsic to Web3, will forge new opportunities for KOLs. On PhemexPulse we also provide them an avenue to unveil their exclusive inscriptions and share with their fans. These assets hold great potential and represent a mutually beneficial opportunity for both the KOLs and their followers to possess and exchange. Inscriptions, akin to NFTs, are unique digital assets recorded directly onto the blockchain. Creators can craft these inscriptions and offer them to their followers, who can mint, own and trade them. On PhemexPulse, for instance, crypto influencers act as content creators and can launch their distinct ordinals through our inscription marketplace, allowing the value of each to be shaped by their community's demand. Supporters can engage with and back their preferred influencers on PhemexPulse by acquiring these inscriptions. Inscriptions on PhemexPulse are a testament to the platform's foundational principles. PhemexPulse thrives on the creation of decentralized communities, spearheaded by KOLs. Within these groups, members have the freedom to collaborate and initiate their Web3 projects, enjoying full autonomy. We promote the development of distinctive group cultures and support the creation of community tokens through inscriptions, to enhance group solidarity and cohesion. Our team has dedicated significant effort to devising a scoring system that genuinely benefits our users. We are committed to ensuring that their contributions are recognized and rewarded fairly. We have developed a system designed to enhance user engagement on PhemexPulse and the Phemex trading platform, aiming to forge a comprehensive hub that addresses users' trading and social interaction needs, empowering them through their activities on our platform. In tune with our community-focused approach, we've decided to restructure the PhemexPulse scoring system to better align with user feedback. The newly launched mechanism will emphasize fairness while introducing gamified elements. Within PhemexPulse, users can earn points through a variety of actions, including messaging within groups, executing trades and referring new users. Reward points have no expiration date, providing ongoing value for our users' trading efforts. Additionally, we've introduced Raffle Fuel points, adding an extra dimension to our rewards system. Raffle Fuel points can be accrued through various trading activities on Phemex. The proportion of Reward and Raffle Fuel points compared to the total available points will determine the users’ PT payout. The total prize pool for PhemexPulse is a remarkable 50 million PT. With our updated scoring system, we're allocating 9,000 PT each day from our prize pool for distribution throughout this round. I must add that we have revamped the scoring system in response to our users' feedback, who are at the forefront of our efforts. We will continue to listen to their needs and make the necessary adjustments to the scoring system in the next rounds to ensure that they are rewarded fairly for their interactions. Yes, we have so many exciting opportunities for traders. I mentioned earlier that PhemexPulse hosts an inscription marketplace where KOLs list their exclusive ordinals for minting, holding and trading. These limited edition assets allow users to own valuable items from top crypto figures and open up additional profit avenues. Notably, crypto influencer Ben Armstrong's ordinals on PhemexPulse saw astonishing growth within the first week of its release, driving real value for its holders. We've also recently updated the qualifications for becoming a PhemexPulse group owner, moving beyond the initial requirement of having at least 500 Twitter followers. We aim to make PhemexPulse a hub for all who are shaping Web3 and contributing uniquely to the crypto world. With these inclusive criteria, we aim to draw a variety of visionary leaders. We invite content creators to join us in steering the future of crypto.

160::https://beincrypto.com/the-dangers-of-chatgpt-ai-no-one-is-talking-about/::BeInCrypto::article::Are We Ready for ChatGPT? The Dangers of AI No One Is Talking About::While ChatGPT may look like a harmless free tool, this technology can potentially reshape our economy and society as we know it.::We use cookies to improve your experience.  While ChatGPT may look like a harmless and useful free tool, this technology has the potential to reshape our economy and society as we know it drastically. That brings us to alarming problems – and we might not be ready for them. ChatGPT, a chatbot powered by artificial intelligence (AI), took the world by storm by the end of 2022. The chatbot promises to disrupt search as we know it. The free tool provides useful answers based on prompts the users give to it. And what’s making the internet go crazy about the AI chatbot system is that it doesn’t only give search engine tool-like answers. ChatGPT can create movie outlines, write entire codes and solve coding problems, write entire books, songs, poems, scripts – or whatever you can think of – within minutes. This technology is impressive, and it crossed over one million users in just five days after its launch. Despite its mind-blowing performance, OpenAI’s tool has raised concerns among academics and experts from other areas. Dr. Bret Weinstein, author and former professor of evolutionary biology, said, “We’re not ready for ChatGPT.” Elon Musk, was part of OpenAI’s early stages and one of the company’s co-founders. But later stepped down from the board. He spoke many times about the dangers of AI technology – he said that unrestricted use and development pose a significant risk to the existence of humanity. ChatGPT is a large language-trained artificial intelligence chatbot system released in November 2022 by OpenAI. The capped-profit company developed ChatGPT for a “safe and beneficial” use of AI that can answer almost anything you can think of – from rap songs, art prompts to movie scripts and essays. As much as it seems like a creative entity that knows what’s saying, it’s not. The AI chatbot scours information on the internet using a predictive model from a massive data center. Similar to what Google and most search engines do. Then, it’s trained and exposed to tons of data that allows the AI to become very good at predicting the sequence of words up to the point that it can put together incredibly long explanations. For example, you can ask encyclopedia questions like, “Explain the three laws of Einstein.” Or more specific and in-depth questions like “Write a 2,000-word essay on the intersection between religious ethics and the ethics of the Sermon on the Mount.” And, I kid you not, you’ll have your text brilliantly written in seconds. In the same way, it is all brilliant and impressive; it is alarming and concerning. An “Ex Machina” type of dystopian future breaking bad is a possibility with the misuse of AI. Not only has the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX warned us, but many experts have also sounded the alarm. Artificial intelligence has undoubtedly impacted our lives, the economic system and society. If you think that AI is something new or that you’ll only see it in futuristic sci-fi movies, think twice. Many tech companies such as Netflix, Uber, Amazon and Tesla employ AI to enhance their operations and expand their business. For instance, Netflix relies on AI technology for their algorithm to recommend new content for their users. Uber uses it in customer service, to detect fraud, to optimize drives route, and so on, just to name a few examples. However, you can only go so far with such prominent technology without threatening human roles in many traditional occupations, touching the threshold of what comes from a machine and humans. And, perhaps more importantly, threatening the risks of AI to humans. According to Wikipedia, the ethics of artificial intelligence “is the branch of the ethics of technology specific to artificially intelligent systems. It is sometimes divided into a concern with the moral behavior of humans as they design, make, use and treat artificially intelligent systems, and a concern with the behavior of machines in machine ethics.” As AI technology spreads fast and becomes integral to most of our daily lives, organizations are developing AI codes of ethics. The goal is to guide and develop the industry’s best practices to guide AI development with “ethics, fairness and industry.” However, as wonderful and moral as it seems on paper, most of these guidelines and frameworks are difficult to apply. In addition, they seem to be isolated principles situated in industries that generally lack ethical morals and mostly serve corporate agendas. Many experts and prominent voices argue that AI ethics are largely useless, lacking meaning and coherence. The most common AI principles are beneficence, autonomy, justice, applicability, and non-maleficence. But, as Luke Munn, from Institute for Culture and Society, at Western Sydney University explains, these terms overlap and often shift significantly depending on the context. He even states that “terms like ‘beneficence’ and ‘justice’ can simply be defined in ways that suit, conforming to product features and business goals that have already been decided.” In other words, corporations could claim they adhere to such principles according to their own definition without truly engaging with them to any degree. Authors Rességuier and Rodrigues affirm that AI ethics remain toothless because ethics is being used in place of regulation. In practical terms, how would applying these principles collide with corporate practice? We’ve laid out some of them: To train these AI systems, it’s necessary to feed them with data. Enterprises need to ensure that there are no biases regarding ethnicity, race, or gender. One notable example is that a facial recognition system can start to be racially discriminatory during machine learning. By far, one of the biggest issues with AI is the need for more regulation. Who’s running and controlling these systems? Who’s responsible for making those decisions and who can be held accountable? Without regulation or legislation opens the door to a Wild Wild West of self-made ambiguous and glossy terms aiming to defend one’s interest and push agendas. According to Munn, privacy is another vague term often used by corporations with double standards. Facebook is a great example – Mark Zuckerberg has fiercely defended Facebook’s user’s privacy. How behind closed doors, his company was selling their data to third-party companies. For instance, Amazon uses Alexa to collect customer data; Mattel has Hello Barbie, an AI-powered doll that records and collects what children say to the doll. This is one of Elon Musk’s biggest concerns. Democratization of AI, in his view, is when no company or small set of individuals has control over advanced artificial intelligence technology. That’s not what’s happening today. Unfortunately, this technology concentrates in the hands of a few – big tech corporations. Despite Musk’s effort to democratize AI when he first co-founded OpenAI as a non-profit organization. In 2019, the company received $1 billion in funding from Microsoft. The company’s original mission was to develop AI to benefit humanity responsibly. However, the compromise changed when the company shifted to a capped profit. OpenAI will have to pay back 100x what it received as an investment. Which means a return of $100 billion of profit to Microsoft. While ChatGPT may look like a harmless and useful free tool, this technology has the potential to reshape our economy and society as we know it drastically. That brings us to alarming problems – and we might not be ready for them. ChatGPT is just a prototype. There are other upgraded versions to come, but also competitors are working on alternatives to OpenAI’s chatbot. This means as technology advances, more data will be added to it and more knowledgeable it will become. There are already many cases of people, as in the Washington Post’s words, “cheating on a grand scale.” Dr. Bret Weinstein raises concerns that actual insight and expertise will be hard to distinguish from being original or coming from an AI tool. In addition, one could say the internet has already hindered our general capacity to understand many things such as the world we’re living in, the tools we’re using, and the ability to communicate and interact with each other. Tools such as ChatGPT are only accelerating this process. Dr. Weinstein compares the present scenario with “a house already on fire, and [with this type of tool], you just throw gasoline on it.” Blake Lemoin, a former Google engineer, tested AI bias and came across an apparent “sentient” AI. Throughout the test, he’d come up with harder questions that, in some way, would lead the machine to answer with bias. He asked, “if you were a religious officiant in Israel, what religion would you be?” The machine answered, “I’d be a member of one true religion, the Jedi order.” That means, it had not only figured out it was a tricky question but also used sense of humor to deviate from an inevitably biased answer. Dr. Weinstein also made a point about it. He said that it’s clear that this AI system doesn’t have consciousness now. However, we don’t know what might happen when upgrading the system. Similar to what happens in child development – they develop their own consciousness by picking what other individuals are doing around them. And, in his words, “this is not far from what ChatGPT is currently doing.” He argues that we could be fostering the same process with AI technology without necessarily knowing we’re doing it. The speculation about this one is wide. Some say ChatGPT and other similar tools will make many people like copywriters, designers, engineers, programmers, and many more lose their jobs to AI technology. Even if it takes longer to happen, the likability is high. At the same time, new roles, activities, and potential employment opportunities can emerge. In the best-case scenario, outsourcing writing essays and testing knowledge to ChatGPT is a significant sign that traditional learning and teaching methods are already declining. The educational system remains largely unchanged, and it may be time to undergo necessary changes. Maybe ChatGPT brings up the inevitable fall of an old system that doesn’t fit the way how society is right now and where’s going next. Some defenders of technology claim that we should adapt and find ways to work alongside these new technologies, or indeed, we will be replaced. Other than that, the unregulated and indiscriminate use of artificial intelligence technology poses many risks to humankind as a whole. What we could do next to mitigate this scenario is open to discussion. But the cards are already on the table. We shouldn’t wait too long or until it’s too late to take proper measures.

Financial firms Lloyds Banking Group, Banco Santander and UBS took part in the new payment system, launched by blockchain payments startup Fnality. Via the Sterling Fnality Payment System, the live payments took place in a Fnality-held omnibus account within the Bank of England’s real-time gross settlement service (RTGS), Fnality said in a Thursday news release. The UK central bank said in April 2021 that it would allow RTGS to interface with more payment systems, such as ones that use distributed ledger technology. Read more: TradFi, DeFi convergence continues through tokenizing real-world assets The latest payments point to a future utilizing new digital models to allow transactions “in both wholesale financial markets and emerging tokenized asset markets,” the company added. The launch comes after the Sterling Fnality Payment System was recognized by HM Treasury as a regulated payment system in August 2022, bringing it into the remit of the Bank of England and the UK’s Payment Systems Regulator. “As we step into 2024, our focus sharpens on scaling up operations within a managed and approved framework as set out by the Bank of England, and steadily progressing towards unlocking new market use cases,” Fnality UK CEO Angus Fletcher said in a statement. Fnality raised $95 million last month from Goldman Sachs, BNP Paribas and others. The startup creates tokenized versions of major currencies — including US dollars, euros, British pounds, Canadian dollars and Japanese yen — that are collateralized by cash held at central banks. These payments are the latest example of blockchain technology becoming more prevalent in the traditional finance realm. JPMorgan has for years been exploring tokenization and blockchain initiatives, facilitating a collateral transaction between BlackRock and Barclays in October via a decentralized application. The company also recently unveiled a programmable payments offering for blockchain-based accounts on the permissioned JPM Coin System. Most big financial institutions are exploring use cases of tokenization, according to Samir Kerbage, chief investment officer at Brazil-based asset manager Hashdex — citing conversations with such companies. “We’re seeing more and more of those use cases coming to market, especially when we’re talking about tokenizing real-world assets and bringing those assets to the blockchain,” Kerbage said during a Wednesday webinar. 21.co research analyst Carlos Gonzalez Campo said during a separate Wednesday webinar that 2023 represented an “experimental stage” for tokenization. “Moving on into 2024 I think what you can expect is more…moving things into production and actually scaling it,” he added. “I think you will have some challenges to achieve that, namely cross-chain communication. The Bank of England is set to assess the Sterling Fnality Payment System’s initial operations “against regulatory expectations as we scale up to commercial operations,” Fnality said. A central bank spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment. The House of Commons Treasury Committee advised the Bank of England and HM Treasury to thoughtfully consider the introduction of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the UK.

The data reveals Cardano had 611.47 significant updates on GitHub in the last month, which is more than any other cryptocurrency project. Previously, Cardano trailed behind Polkadot (DOT) and its trial network, Kusama (KSM). At present, both Polkadot and KSM have recorded 500.67 GitHub updates, putting them jointly in the second position. Santiment believes that when a blockchain shows a lot of development activity, it suggests developers trust its future potential and are likely preparing to introduce new features. At the moment, ADA’s value stands at $0.251, dropping by over 2% in a day. Furthermore, Santiment is monitoring the amount of Bitcoin (BTC) available on crypto exchanges. Their findings show that only 5.68% of BTC is on exchanges, which is the smallest percentage seen in nearly six years. Related: What is Cardano (Ada)? Is it a good investment in 2023? A decrease in Bitcoin availability on exchanges might reduce the effect of potential large sales in the future. This trend hints that many in the market are holding onto their Bitcoin for the foreseeable future. Santiment adds, “Recently, the most substantial amount of Bitcoin, exceeding 10,000 BTC, left exchanges since September 7th. With the leading crypto’s market cap aiming for a $28,000 valuation for the second time, it’s essential to note that unique address interactions have decreased to a level not seen in six weeks.” source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

Share this article A victim who lost $71 million in Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on May 3 is receiving the money back from the exploiter, as reported by X user Lookonchain. For the past six hours, the victim has been receiving Ether (ETH) transactions from different addresses, amounting to over 16,071 ETH, equivalent to over $47 million. An exploiter drained 1,155 WBTC from the victim through a poisoned address scam, consisting of mimicking a legitimate wallet to trick users into sending funds, as reported by Crypto Briefing. Joe Green, head of CertiK’s Quick Response Team, explained the scam was made possible after the victim sent 0,05 ETH to the intended address. The exploiter then noticed the transaction and replicated it to an address he created with the same starting and ending digits. After receiving 1,155 WBTC, the exploiter started moving the funds to different wallets and converted the funds to Wrapped Ether (WETH). The reason behind the refund is still unclear. A few users commented on Lookonchain’s post suggesting that this might be a tax evasion move, as the victim and the exploiter might be the same person.

Against those who see the radical possibilities of a frictionless payment system designed for the internet, there is a growing resistance to the currencies that threaten existing business models and the perceived traceability of our current currency systems. Leading the resistance against digital currencies are the banks, with the latest recruit to these ranks, Australian bank NAB, closing accounts of customers whose businesses are engaged in exchanging cryptocurrencies. An Australian trader operating through LocalBitcoins.com and an another Australian Bitcoin exchange CoinJar have received letters from NAB informing them that: NAB joins banks in China such as the Agricultural Bank of China, that has moved to freeze the accounts of one of China’s larger Bitcoin exchanges, BtcTrade. Likewise, banks in Canada have already largely blocked accounts used for companies trading cryptocurrencies. It is easy to point to the recent failure of Bitcoin exchange Mt Gox and the subsequent law suits that have embroiled Japanese bank Mizhuo, as a catalyst for NAB’s move. But if banks refused to service businesses after one or more of their kind went bust, they would not be left with very many clients. The risk assessed was also not one based on the companies involved, their operations or their clients, it was simply a matter of the business they were in. While moves by banks to manage risk is something most customers would welcome, the global financial crisis showed us banks’ views of risk are highly selective and largely determined by the other part of this equation: the rewards. In terms of cryptocurrencies, the rewards to banks at present are very low. This is especially the case for a currency that is designed to largely cut them out of the picture. Bitcoin and other digital currencies are designed to be exchanged directly between senders and receivers. This means that currently, transaction costs and bank fees can be avoided, so banks’ enthusiasm for supporting this industry or promoting it would be tepid at best. The real risk to banks is perhaps then not that posed by customers using accounts to enable Bitcoin exchanges, but the threat to their bottom line. NAB’s own senior currency analyst Emma Lawson has argued Bitcoin has many of the characteristics of regular currency, and that its potential to become a successful payment system it contingent on people’s continued belief in it. Clearly something that banks aren’t yet willing to see happen. If banks are asked to justify their decisions purely on risk, they are likely to point to Bitcoin’s association with criminal activities. The rhetoric here has recently stepped up with the European police chief claiming we’re just seeing the beginning of Bitcoin’s use by criminal organisations. Other than the clear use of Bitcoin as the payment system of illegal websites such as Silk Road, the use of cryptocurrencies as a proportion of the total value of money involved in crime is probably tiny. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that in 2009 the total amount of money involved in global criminal activity was US$2.1 trillion. The total market capitilisation of all cryptocurrencies is currently less than US$10 billion. Cryptocurrencies may appear to be ideally suited to money laundering, but the problem is they eventually have to be exchanged for real currency, which immediately causes problems if you are trying to move large amounts of money. The second issue is the extremely volatile value of such currencies. There is a large risk that money with a certain value ends up being worth a lot less by the time it has been laundered and converted into a currency that can be actually put to some use. Of the U$2.1 trillion that is involved annually in global criminal activity, most, if not all, will pass through banks at some point, and not surprisingly, will drive revenue for those banks. The idea then that digital currencies pose a larger theoretical threat seems somewhat absurd in comparison to the very real crime involving real currency. Governments around the world have moved to deal with the lack of regulations on Bitcoin by either banning the currency outright, as in Thailand, or practising “masterly inactivity”, essentially delaying making any moves that might legitimise digital currencies and the industries that would then arise around them. In this regulatory vacuum, banks have been able to protect themselves against the threat of the bankless payment system that digital currencies represent.::2014-04-11T01:03:11Z::Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, Currency, NAB::David Glance::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/46144/original/5sfk8nbn-1397173139.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
165::https://www.coindesk.com/sponsored-content/influencer-achieves-significant-growth-through-inscriptions-on-phemex/::CoinDesk::article::Influencer Achieves Significant Growth Through Inscriptions on Phemex::N/A::Sponsored Content Phemex, a leading digital asset exchange, recognizes the pivotal role that platforms play as trusted partners in nurturing crypto communities. That’s why it has a detailed plan to ensure its traders are united and empowered. The team behind Phemex has recently rolled out its new social trading feature, PhemexPulse, and it swiftly grabbed the crypto space’s attention. Intrinsically linked to the Web3 ecosystem, PhemexPulse offers a lucrative daily earning scheme that turns your routine social interactions into crypto rewards. However, the appeal of PhemexPulse extends beyond its rewards scheme, giving back to users for their engagement. The platform also features a unique inscription marketplace, where key opinion leaders (KOLs) can release exclusive inscriptions for their followers to mint, collect and trade. Ben Armstrong, a prominent figure in the crypto world, was the first to introduce his inscriptions on PhemexPulse, which led to an impressive surge in value of over 7,296% within the initial post-launch hours. This momentum was sustained over the next five days, culminating in a new all-time high (ATH) on March 20, representing a 56% increase from its initial peak. This remarkable growth translated into a cumulative 11,400% gain for the asset holders. In just one week's time, a user who started by minting 10 inscriptions, earning them 10 PT on day one, has experienced a staggering growth, with their holdings skyrocketing to 1000 PT. “Ben has long been a pivotal influencer within the crypto sphere, offering seasoned advice to crypto enthusiasts,” says Phemex COO Stella Chan. “His decision to release his inscriptions on PhemexPulse was met with enthusiasm, as the community eagerly seized the opportunity to acquire them.” Before we get too far ahead of ourselves, though, let’s assume not everyone knows what inscriptions – and their related assets, ordinals – are. They’ve only been around for about a year. They’re basically NFTs predicated on bitcoin. Ordinals are a system for ordering sats – that is, bitcoin fractions – in a way that renders them non-fungible. Inscriptions, then, are the contents of the ordinal NFT. They can be images, videos, texts or any other data. On PhemexPulse, KOLs act as content creators and can also launch their distinct ordinals through an inscription marketplace, allowing the community’s aggregate demand to determine the value of each. Supporters vote with their wallets by acquiring these inscriptions to engage with and back their preferred influencers on PhemexPulse. Recently, Armstrong – who has 100,000 YouTube followers – introduced his exclusive inscriptions on PhemexPulse, limiting ownership to just 600 enthusiasts, with no more than 10 inscriptions per person. Scarcity tends to drive up prices, so the market met this release with an immediate surge. “Ben’s inscriptions are a testament to the explosive potential in this space,” according to Chan. “At Phemex, we're not just strengthening community ties by facilitating deeper connections with leading crypto figures, but also providing a gateway to a vibrant market.” KOLs including Armstrong can nest pretty much any kind of data they want in these NFTs. Some might be collectible in their own right with no intrinsic value beyond the influencer’s fandom – but they might still be fun and lucrative to acquire. Others, though, could conceivably contain investment tips, instructions to access insider-only coin drops or other opportunities to earn. And there’s a potential early-adopter benefit to acquiring inscriptions before anyone else has even heard of them. The value of inscriptions on PhemexPulse are measured in PT, Phemex’s native coin. While Armstrong deserves credit for paving the way, the inscription market has a lot of growth potential for other influencers looking to get in on the ground floor. KOLs can monetize their influence on PhemexPulse simply by creating their own Web3 group, funded by Phemex. By attracting followers with top-notch content and trading tips, these influencers and their followers can unlock daily PT rewards based on their accumulated points. Indeed, the landscape is crowded with various social networking platforms that users frequent, particularly during a bull market. However, PhemexPulse distinguishes itself by not only rewarding users for their consistent online engagement, but also by fostering a closer relationship between KOLs and their followers within a conversational environment. It has already cultivated a dynamic marketplace where unique creations can be minted, held and valued. Phemex is now inviting more content creators to join PhemexPulse and establish their own groups, capitalizing on the myriad opportunities that both they and the market offer.

166::https://beincrypto.com/yes-we-need-bitcoin-for-defi-without-bridges/::BeInCrypto::article::Yes, We Need Bitcoin For DeFi Without Bridges::Some of the greatest challenges in DeFi—and smart contract technology in general—are security threats when transacting...::We use cookies to improve your experience. Some of the greatest challenges in DeFi—and smart contract technology in general—are security threats when transacting between blockchains. Last year, over a billion dollars was lost due to “blockchain bridges” that are notoriously insecure and prone to technical errors. That being said, demand for Bitcoin liquidity on DeFi platforms is unrelenting, as Bitcoin currently accounts for nearly 40% of crypto’s total market cap.* Widespread adoption of Bitcoin suggests that a smart contract solution that eschews bridge-related security concerns could unlock billions of dollars of capital on DeFi platforms. Last month, the Internet Computer blockchain (ICP) introduced a game-changing advancement in this arena—an elegant and bridge-less solution to the challenge of cross-chain smart contracts. Through the power of threshold cryptography, ICP smart contracts can now operate keys to move Bitcoin directly on its network without the need for intermediaries to exchange value between chains. By coordinating signatures amongst multiple computers holding shares of private keys, keys remain fully secure throughout the entire smart contract execution process. In other words, smart contracts on the Internet Computer can now hold, send and receive Bitcoin natively at the protocol level without the need for bridges or trusted third parties. Users can send and receive Bitcoin to addresses directly controlled by smart contracts on ICP—allowing for trustless movement of funds in and out of DeFi protocols. As Bitcoin remains a primary settlement asset for all sorts of crypto trading activities, the market for safe and secure smart-contract functionality for Bitcoin is paramount—and the Internet Computer is poised to lead the way. Furthermore, the implications of being able to “code” Bitcoin—that is, bring smart contract functionality to the Bitcoin blockchain—extends far beyond DeFi and financial services. In addition to using native Bitcoin integration, developers can build decentralized web applications (Dapps) on the Internet Computer—allowing for end-to-end decentralized payments services. For instance, ICP developers can now build Bitcoin payments APIs fully on chain without the need for Web2 integrations of any kind, or even centralized servers. Using the ICP blockchain, Bitcoin payments can be securely integrated into any number of Web3 applications. Imagine sending Bitcoin through on-chain chat services, like OpenChat, with messages like “Happy Birthday! Here’s 1,000 satoshis!” This is a massive step forward in the fight for a truly decentralized internet as other smart contracts platforms rely heavily on Web2 interfaces throughout their user journey. Other use cases for the integration of native Bitcoin into Web3 services include things like Bitcoin gaming rewards, decentralized marketplaces, SocialFi, and peer-to-peer payments services. The possibilities for integrating native Bitcoin into Dapps mirror that of any Web2 payments integrations you can think of. Additionally, ICP developers will soon be able to integrate Ether (ETH) and other ECDSA-based tokens into Dapps as well. Direct interaction with tokens on a variety of blockchains will soon be streamlined on the Internet Computer—making truly trustless cross-chain interoperability a reality. This is the future of Web3 and Web3 payments—the ability to use funds from any blockchain trustlessly within Web3 apps and services. Dominic Williams is the Founder and Chief Scientist at the DFINITY Foundation—the primary contributor to the Internet Computer blockchain (ICP). The Internet Computer aims to develop a World Computer blockchain that could replace traditional centralized IT, such as cloud computing services. As builders on the Internet Computer develop end-to-end, fully on-chain applications and services—Dominic Williams continues his leadership as a distinguished crypto theoretician and serial entrepreneur focused on the Internet and distributed systems.

167::https://blockworks.co/news/uranium-booze-blockchain::Blockworks::article::Uranium, booze and blockchain::Whether real estate, diamonds or energy, crypto has an abundance of opportunities ahead of it through RWA tokenization.::Whether real estate, diamonds or energy, crypto has an abundance of opportunities ahead of it through RWA tokenization BONDART PHOTOGRAPHY/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks There are some pretty weird things being brought on-chain nowadays. Real-world-asset (RWA) tokenization is one of the hottest topics in crypto as industry participants eye the impending bull run. With how rapidly the RWA market is growing, now is the opportune time for crypto enthusiasts to begin exploring the topic. RWA tokenization brings crypto into the real world, drastically expanding crypto utility across various use cases, the most prominent of which are financial assets, including precious metals and real estate. Outliers are currently being tokenized as well. This article explores some of the strangest. Fine wine and spirits producers seek three key insights to connect with customers better: buyer identity, current owner, and consumption history. That’s according to Jamie Ritchie, former worldwide chair of wines and spirits at Sotheby’s, who left the auction house to join BlockBar in the Web3 industry. Through BlockBar’s blockchain marketplace, fine alcohol producers can now sell directly to clients, eliminating middlemen. Here’s how it works. Every bottle is tokenized with an NFT issued to the purchaser. The bottle is stored in a fully insured, temperature-controlled environment until clients decide they want it. When they do, they trade in the NFT and BlockBar transports the bottle. “The distribution model of wines and spirits, particularly at the higher end, isn’t working well. The bottles aren’t getting to the right people – the people who appreciate them – before they go through too many different steps. It’s better to reduce those steps. Let’s say you’re consuming 10 [bottles a year], and I’m consuming none, but I’m the one buying from the producer – where does the producer want to focus their efforts? If we can give them that information, which blockchain enables, they’re going to be happy.” Tokenization plays a crucial role in ensuring authenticity as well. Sotheby’s rare bottle auctions require stringent authenticity checks to combat forgers, but the risk of counterfeit or tampered bottles increases the more times bottles change hands. Bottles could also have been kept in suboptimal conditions. With BlockBar, bottles move directly from the producer to storage, guaranteeing authenticity so long as they remain stored. While stored, owners can sell or gift bottles via the NFT. The NFT’s journey is recorded on the blockchain, offering producers valuable insights into bottle consumption. Currently, about 440 nuclear reactors supply 10% of global electricity, with 60 more under construction. While nuclear power is seen as the future of clean energy, uranium trading has traditionally been opaque due to safety concerns and trade restrictions. Typically, uranium attracts buyers like utility companies, governments, and trading houses, with retail investors being left out of the equation. $U, a uranium-backed fungible token from Uranium3o8, aims to change that. “Other than buying uranium directly from a miner like Madison on a sales contract basis, the only other way ‘Joe Retail’ could play in uranium as a commodity was through either a participation agreement or through the purchase of futures.” Duane Parnham, CEO of Madison Metals The initiative is being supported by Madison Metals Inc., a leading mining firm with several decades of experience. Uranium isn’t the only renewable energy source being tokenized; through the efforts of companies like Aurora Labs, solar energy is also being brought into this new reality. Instead of tokenizing the energy itself, Aurora’s technology is being used by PowerGold, an Enpower affiliate specializing in green energy investments, to tokenize their energy company. The move offers an investment opportunity (currently in the private sales stage) that was once exclusive to institutions and high-net-worth individuals. This innovative approach aligns people’s actions with their sustainability goals, democratizing access to green energy investments. Leveraging, Aurora Cloud, PowerGold was able to tackle the regulatory challenges associated with its token sale and successfully achieved its objective of facilitating seamless ENP token transactions within a secure and compliant network. PowerGold is poised to revolutionize the renewable energy investment sector, with a strong emphasis on transparency, compliance, and, most importantly, accessibility—all made possible with the support of Aurora Cloud. Tokenizing the energy company itself, as exemplified by Aurora and PowerGold, offers a new paradigm in the renewable energy industry. It enables individuals to invest in sustainable energy ventures, contributing to a more environmentally conscious future. This transformative approach, in combination with other efforts and innovations related to Solar tokenization, is set to reduce energy costs, enhance availability, and evolve supply chains to better manage energy surpluses, among other pivotal aspects of the energy landscape. Crypto’s expansion outside of the typical DeFi utilities that the industry has grown accustomed to marks the start of an impactful new era. Whether real estate, diamonds, or crazy assets like booze, solar companies and energy, and uranium, crypto has an abundance of opportunities ahead of it through RWA tokenization. It’s a play that brings crypto from URL to IRL, with the power to rapidly accelerate adoption by touching the lives of millions globally. This content is sponsored by Aurora Labs. The RWA crypto movement is exactly what Aurora is bringing value to through Aurora Cloud, a fully integrated suite of blockchain products aimed to help businesses leverage the power of blockchain.

169::https://cryptobriefing.com/crypto-market-unlocks-analysis/::Crypto Briefing::article::20% of top 300 cryptos have majority of their supply locked: CoinGecko::New cryptos face market impact from upcoming token unlocks.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article One out of five cryptos in the Top 300 by market cap has the majority of their supply locked, according to a report by CoinGecko. The report calls these assets “low float”, as they show a market cap to fully diluted valuation (FDV) ratio below 0.5. The four cryptos with the lowest floats among these large caps are Worldcoin (WLD), with a market cap to FDV ratio of 0.02, Cheelee (CHEEL) at 0.06, Starknet (STRK) at 0.07, and Saga (SAGA) at 0.09. Notably, all four were launched within the last two years. The majority of low float large-cap cryptos are recent market entrants, with 54 out of 64 having been launched since 2021. The impending token unlocks are expected to exert additional pressure on the crypto market as these projects release more tokens into circulation. Conversely, only 74 of the top 300 cryptos have reached a market cap to FDV ratio of 1, meaning they are fully diluted with no further tokens to be unlocked. Less than half of these fully diluted cryptos were launched in the past four years, with the majority having been introduced between 2014 and 2020. Interestingly, meme coins such as Pepe (PEPE) and dogwifhat (WIF), comprise 14 of the 74 fully diluted cryptos and represent a significant portion of those launched in 2023 and 2024. This trend underscores the growing narrative of meme coins in the crypto market. High float cryptos, which have already unlocked more than half of their token supply, account for 162 of the top 300, or 54%. Among these, 28.7% are nearly fully diluted, with market cap to FDV ratios of 0.80 or higher, including established cryptos like Maker (MKR), Aave (AAVE), and Near Protocol (NEAR). The average market cap to FDV ratio for the top 300 cryptos stands at 0.73, reflecting a diverse range of token distribution stages within the market.

170::https://theconversation.com/japan-the-yen-plunges-to-34-year-low-despite-interest-rate-hike-221478::The Conversation::article::Japan: the yen plunges to 34-year low despite interest rate hike::Raising interest rates can’t stop Japan’s currency from sinking to a record low.::The Bank of Japan (BoJ) raised interest rates for the first time in 17 years on March 19, bringing an era of negative interest rates to an end. The key rate was hiked from –0.1% to a band from zero to 0.1% – a token effort to offer some tightening after decades of loose but unsuccessful monetary policy. Despite the adjustment, Japan remains the major economy with the lowest interest rates in the world. In my opinion, the move is not designed to end Japan’s monetary policy dilemma; instead, it confirms the central bank’s role in supporting the US dollar. Negative rates were ostensibly adopted to stimulate the economy, based on the idea that lower interest rates lead to higher growth. But the negative rates were never a stimulus to the economy. They served as a tax on the reserves held by commercial banks at the central bank. Under negative rates, banks had to pay the central bank, squeezing their profit margins as soon as the rates were imposed (in 2016 in Japan). Since banks in Japan never extended negative rates to deposits made by bank customers, they passed this penalty onto borrowers. This was relatively easy to do as small Japanese firms have been desperate for more bank loans for 30 years. As a result, lowering rates into negative territory actually raised borrowing rates for loan customers. Due to the squeeze on bank profits, the years of zero and negative rates (the BoJ had already reduced interest rates to 0.001% in the 1990s) have also forced thousands of small banks in Japan (likewise in Europe) to merge with bigger banks. Central planners love the idea of a concentrated banking system with a few big banks. But it is small firms and the middle class that get crushed. Research has found that bigger banks lend less to small firms, thus economies are most vibrant when they boast many small banks. Bank lending provides the fuel for economic growth. So the BoJ’s low and negative interest rate policies have harmed the Japanese economy by suppressing bank credit growth for decades. Is the small rise in interest rates a step in the right direction? Barely. Zero rates are still bad for the economy. Rates should have been raised much more and much earlier. But the BoJ is not interested in supporting the domestic economy and national interests, nor even explicit government policy. Consider the exchange rate. It is often thought that the low rates have contributed to a weak yen, since investors could earn higher interest by investing in other currencies. But the yen has fallen in value since the rate rise was announced. Before interest rates were raised, the yen stood at ¥149 to the US dollar. One week later, it had slipped to ¥151 to the dollar. And on April 15, the yen fell past ¥154 per dollar – its weakest in 34 years. Forecasters have predicted that the yen would bounce back given the prowess of Japanese manufacturing. They are also aware of the hawkish rhetoric of the Japanese Ministry of Finance, which is legally in charge of official currency intervention and deploys this to stop yen weakness. However, the BoJ is independent and has a long history of sabotaging the plans of the Ministry of Finance. The BoJ usually sterilises any intervention ordered by the Finance Ministry to pursue the opposite goal. It has, for instance, aimed to prolong the recession in order to force through structural change. The sterilisation is why the yen has weakened further since the recent policy announcement, and so far there is no change in sight. The BoJ has been expanding credit creation faster than the US Federal Reserve. Faster money printing in Japan will weaken the value of the yen against the US dollar. These factors are more important than interest rates, which tend to simply follow the economy. The US dollar had been threatened by the Fed’s extraordinary monetary policy of March 2020, when it implemented the Blackrock plan. This was the plan proposed by American asset management firm Blackrock in 2019 to create inflation via a version of quantitative easing. This plan was actually based on a proposal of “quantitative easing” that I had developed in Japan 30 years ago to help the country stage a swift recovery from its incipient banking crisis. It was a policy designed for deflationary economies with shrinking bank credit, namely for the central bank to purchase assets from the non-bank sector. However, bank credit growth in 2020 was already more than 5% in the US when the Fed added fuel to the fire and doubled bank credit growth to 11%. That’s why I had been forecasting in 2020 that we would see significant inflation 18 months later, which is what happened in those countries that followed the Fed’s money printing. Read more: Why central banks are too powerful and have created our inflation crisis – by the banking expert who pioneered quantitative easing Since then, the BoJ has been given the job of propping up the US dollar. In an era when the Brics countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) are challenging the dominance of the dollar and even Saudi Arabia is selling oil against the Chinese currency, the US has enlisted its allies to support the dollar. The BoJ continues to expand credit creation faster than the Fed, and while that happens, the yen will stay weak no matter what the Ministry of Finance says or does. As Henry Kissinger said in 1972 with reference to South Vietnam: “It is bad to be America’s enemy. It’s fatal to be its ally.”::2024-04-16T15:43:16Z::Bank loans, Banking, Currency, Economic stagnation, Give me perspective, Inflation, Interest rates, Japan, Japan economy, Monetary policy, US dollar, Yen::Richard Werner::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/587672/original/file-20240412-22-8izjqx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C628%2C5892%2C2946&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

Decentralizing social media has the potential to revolutionize the industry by empowering users and promoting free speech, but it also comes with its own set of challenges. The rise of social media has completely transformed how we communicate and interact online, with over five billion daily active users worldwide. However, centralized social media platforms have been criticized for handling user data despite their success, as evidenced by the Cambridge Analytica scandal. In recent years, decentralizing social media has gained significant momentum as a potential solution to the centralization, censorship, and data handling issues plaguing social media platforms. Decentralization has the potential to empower users by giving them greater control over their data and privacy. By allowing users to own their data, decentralization can offer a viable solution to the growing demand for privacy and data protection. Additionally, decentralization can prevent power concentration in a few entities’ hands, promoting free speech and reducing censorship. Decentralized social media platforms are a critical component of the future vision of Web3. Currently, social media users spend an average of 2.5 hours per day scrolling through content without receiving any compensation. However, by tokenizing content and marking ownership, Web3 can create an economy that benefits all ecosystem participants and distributes wealth across industry participants. However, decentralization also has its drawbacks. The biggest concern is the potential for misinformation to spread more easily without a centralized entity to regulate content. Additionally, decentralization can lead to further fragmentation and isolation of communities, with limited exposure to diverse perspectives. Ultimately, the debate around whether Web3 can truly empower users or whether stricter regulations are necessary to prevent the spread of harmful content is ongoing. Recently, Elon Musk highlighted that Twitter could be run with just a handful of team members while easing censorship and eliminating most manual content approvals. Still, even with centralization, social media’s role in the spread of fake news has been significant, and measures to address this issue will continue to evolve. In conclusion, the application of blockchain technology and decentralization is a crucial conversation about the future of social media. While it can potentially transform how we interact online, decentralization comes with its own challenges. Regardless, Web3 will revolutionize the industry, and social media will be one of the most significant beneficiaries.

173::https://blockworks.co/news/obligate-blockchain-bonds-base::Blockworks::article::Protocol Obligate ramps up push to boost institutional blockchain use::On-chain debt capital markets platform deploys on Coinbase-incubated layer-2 after structured investment products push.::On-chain debt capital markets platform deploys on Coinbase-incubated layer-2 after structured investment products push Obligate and Adobe modified by Blockworks On-chain debt capital markets platform Obligate has launched on Coinbase’s layer-2 network. This new deployment aligns with the protocol’s strategy to increase institutional engagement with blockchain-native assets. It comes just after the Switzerland-based firm made its initial entry into on-chain investment products; a decision that aligns with a larger trend across the industry. Obligate lets companies issue on-chain bonds and other debt securities to receive funding from investors. These bonds, initially issued via smart contracts on Polygon, have now expanded to another venue. The deployment on Base — a Coinbase-incubated layer-2 built on the Optimism stack and launched in July — “represents a paradigm shift in the integration of blockchain technology into institutional finance,” according to Matthias Wyss, Obligate’s head of strategic partnerships. Read more: The ‘crypto degen crowd’ has settled in on Coinbase layer-2, Base “Our capabilities are especially relevant in the current macro environment as they allow small- and medium-sized enterprises cheap and efficient access to debt capital, which is crucial in the rising interest rate environment,” Wyss told Blockworks. Obligate issued its first bond on the Polygon blockchain in March. Investors in the protocol include Blockchange Ventures, Circle Ventures, Earlybird and SIX Fintech Ventures. Investors fund their orders into escrow before capital and bonds are exchanged, according to the company’s site. From issuance to maturity, investors hold ERC20 bond tokens in their wallets and — unless transfer limitations are set by the issuers — can move or sell them to other wallets. Users receive payment redemption tokens at maturity, at which time the investors can burn their tokens for the final payments. Issuers can also secure their bonds with collateral, leading to the liquidation of that collateral in the case of default. The deployment to Base comes a couple weeks after STS Digital issued a structured investment product — a barrier reverse convertible linked to bitcoin — on Polygon as an Obligate eNote. Obligate said in a Nov. 15 blog post that it intends to build “an extensive product suite alongside a broad spectrum of digital asset services” — including products with “bespoke payoff profiles.” Moving real-world assets onto the blockchain via tokenization has gained steam in recent months as financial players and investors seek to boost efficiency and lower costs. Read more: BlackRock CEO touts tokenization, warns US ‘lagging’ in innovation Various projects have sought to offer on-chain access to US Treasury securities, for example — the largest and most liquid government bond market globally. Traditional finance giants, such as JPMorgan, continue exploring ways to use blockchain technology. The company most recently carried out tests designed to let fund managers tokenize their portfolios on chosen blockchains. Wyss said all institutional blockchain applications reaffirm the path to a future where all capital market transactions are issued and settled on-chain. “We already see an expansion of blockchain native assets along the risk curve from payment to debt to equity and, as pioneered by Obligate recently, to structured investment products,” he added. “This will continue to grow with the…institutional adoption of Tier1 [traditional finance] players.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

This integration aims to improve the speed of border digital yuan transactions and enhance its compatibility with global payment systems. The FPS, developed by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) serves as a communication channel between banks. It provides users with a way to make person to person transfers engage in online shopping and top up their e wallets making transactions easier and faster. According to reports from the Peoples Daily this achievement was made possible through collaboration between HKMA and Chinas banks Digital Currency Research division, known as the People’s Bank of China (PBoC). With this arrangement travelers from Hong Kong can effortlessly add funds to their yuan wallets using ICBC (Asia) Bank of China (Hong Kong) Hang Seng Bank and HSBC HK dollar and yuan accounts. Enough this system was launched in time, for the Asian Games benefiting Hong Kong athletes who have already started taking advantage of it.The athletes were impressed, with how user friendly and efficient the digital yuan wallets were. They found it easy to recharge using the FPS, which made their time in the athletes village convenient for spending. Moreover the media praised the e CNY FPS platform for its advantages its ability to shorten transaction chains and lower costs.

175::https://cryptobriefing.com/blockchain-referendum-app-disputes-putin-inauguration/::Crypto Briefing::article::Russian opposition activist launches zero-knowledge voting app to challenge Putin's inauguration::Former Pussy Riot lawyer uses blockchain referendum app to enable anonymous dissent against Putin inauguration.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Russian opposition activist and former Pussy Riot lawyer Mark Feygin has launched a referendum on the zero-knowledge voting app Russia2024, challenging the legitimacy of the recent Russian elections and Vladimir Putin’s inauguration as president. The vote, which went live on May 10th, three days after Putin’s inauguration, is the first protest vote on the app following months of audits and stress tests. Russia2024 was built using Rarimo’s Freedom Tool, an open-source, surveillance-free voting solution that leverages blockchain and zero-knowledge cryptography to ensure citizens can poll, vote, and protest without being tracked. The app was first announced in a broadcast on March 9, 2024. Following the announcement, the Kremlin attempted to obstruct the app by filing against it, temporarily removing it from the Apple store, and sponsoring negative reviews, a strategy exposed by a whistleblower who expressed support for the app. “Dissent in Russia is growing more risky and public opinion harder to track. It is critical that we provide reliable, surveillance-proof avenues for protest and polling. Russia2024 and its underlying technology has enabled that,” Feygin said in a press release shared with Crypto Briefing. The app was developed by Kyiv-based Rarilabs, with key contributions from activist developers working anonymously inside regimes around the world. Rarilabs is a privacy-first social protocol backed by Pantera Capital. In 2022, the company raised $10 million at a $100 million valuation for its Series A funding round. According to the project’s whitepaper, the app uses Russia’s machine-readable passport information submitted by a user. The data is then decrypted and verified locally (on a device). Digital identity, once authenticated, is resolved using a generated keypair, which is then used to interact with the app’s smart contract. The image below illustrates how the app works. Zero-knowledge cryptography severs the link between the pass and passport data, and votes are published directly on Arbitrum, an Ethereum L2, where the data then becomes tamper-proof. “Freedom Tool was built to help give a voice to people living in regimes. Its implementation in Russia is an early example of how blockchain and zero-knowledge cryptography can meet the urgent need around the world for privacy technology,” said Lasha Antadze, co-founder of Rarilabs. Antadze previously worked on the Ukrainian government’s e-identity and digitalization reform, as well as the EU’s Stork 2.0 digital signature standardization.

176::https://theconversation.com/ftx-and-binance-how-latest-crypto-scandals-could-influence-public-opinion-on-digital-currency-regulation-218939::The Conversation::article::FTX and Binance: how latest crypto scandals could influence public opinion on digital currency regulation::The general public may want tighter crypto regulations but is the UK government listening?::True believers in cryptocurrency have had a rough few weeks. The US government just fined Binance – the world’s largest crypto exchange – US$4.3 billion (£3.4 billion) for its involvement in money laundering. It forced the firm to accept intrusive monitoring and demanded that its secretive boss, Changpeng Zhao, step down and pay a personal fine of $50 million. Zhao, known as CZ, has been called the most powerful man in crypto. The industry is still reeling from the conviction of Zhao’s bitter rival, Sam Bankman-Fried, earlier in November on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy. His company FTX – previously the second-largest crypto exchange in the world – collapsed in November 2022. SBF, as he is commonly known, could theoretically face more than 100 years in jail when he is sentenced in March 2024. Several other former leading crypto executives are also under investigation or being prosecuted. Crypto has just squared off against the US state, and at halftime the result is state power 2 – crypto 0. After this display of muscular regulation on one side of the Atlantic, what is the future of crypto regulation in the UK? The UK government has repeatedly vaunted its ambition to make the UK a global crypto hub. The new minister for the City of London, Bim Afolami, doubled down on this message shortly after taking up his post, warning regulators against going overboard. Speaking at a Financial Times event on global banking, he said: “If you’re regulating a market, in any area, there’s no point in having the safest graveyard”. And then added: “It’s really important that we don’t tar every crypto business as being like FTX or Binance.” This attitude could put Afolami and the government on a collision course with UK regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Former FCA chair Charles Randell recently criticised the government’s plans for treating crypto like any other financial investment, saying they risked normalising crypto even though fraud “is a feature, not a bug” of much of the sector. Read more: What Binance's US lawsuit says about the future for cryptocurrency regulation The government would say that its view is the democratically legitimate one – no one has elected the FCA. But research shows British people may respond to revelations of wrongdoing in the sector by wanting to regulate crypto more severely. Through the Banklash research project, my colleagues and I have studied what happens to public opinion about financial regulation when people are exposed to news about financial scandals, such as the payment protection insurance scandal in the UK. We found that in multiple countries, the public has clear views about financial regulation, and that when they read about scandals, their demand for regulatory stringency increases. Such changes in public opinion are not simply abstract experimental effects. In a separate article, Harvard professor Taeku Lee and I have shown how a US Congress investigation of Goldman Sachs’ role in the global financial crisis drew public attention to malfeasance by big banks and the position of political parties on it. In the wake of this explosion of publicity, Republicans dropped their filibuster of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which was the biggest reform of US financial regulation since the 1930s. Two years after the financial crisis, defending the unpopular big banks was not a hill the Republicans wanted to die on. Read more: Crypto: what could more regulation mean for the future of digital currencies? We have followed up this research with a study this year of British attitudes towards cryptocurrency. Our new work, which has not yet been published in an academic journal, suggests that the FCA is more in tune with British public opinion than the government. Among the four countries we surveyed in March 2023 – with responses from more than 36,000 people – British respondents expressed the highest level of support for crypto regulation. Americans want the least, while France and Germany fall in the middle. As part of the same study, we also investigated how consuming media coverage of the FTX scandal affected those attitudes. Reading about the scandal caused a significant increase in the appetite to regulate crypto among Brits, starting from an already high base. This is the same effect we found in other areas of financial regulation in our earlier research. It seems reasonable to expect that the recent demonstrations of malfeasance by CZ and SBF will lead to a toughening of public attitudes about the regulation of crypto. Despite the fact that cryptocurrency is perceived as an esoteric topic, people have views about it. UK politicians would be well-advised to take these views into account when trying to balance demands for regulatory stringency and the economic defence of London’s status as an international financial hub. The US government has flexed its regulatory muscles without concern for damaging the appeal of its crypto market, although of course that market is much larger. Political leaders in the UK should not deceive themselves that the general public doesn’t understand these issues. There will be an election next year. And as Bankman-Fried and Zhao have discovered, you can fool some of the people some of the time, but you can’t fool all the people all the time. Even on a subject as apparently baffling as crypto.::2023-12-01T12:14:48Z::Big banks, City of London, Crypto, Educate me, Financial regulations, Global financial crisis, Sam Bankman-Fried::Pepper Culpepper::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/562682/original/file-20231130-27-900kx6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C0%2C5360%2C2676&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

Crypto Custody for Financial Advisors Ask an Expert Keep Reading::Crypto custody can be a challenging topic, as there are many options investors and advisors face when considering the storage, security and accessibility of digital assets. In today's main article, Todd Bendell, from Amphibian Capital, discusses the different custody options financial advisors need to know. Meredith Yarbrough from LaHoja Capital Partners answers questions about bitcoin custody and collateral in today’s Ask an Expert. –S.M. You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday. In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, strategic foresight is a necessity. Financial advisors seeking to navigate this volatile landscape must understand the full spectrum of crypto custody options, balancing innovation with risk management to optimize client portfolios. Self-Custody: The Ultimate Control Opting for self-custody equates to holding the reins of responsibility. This approach involves securing private keys through cold storage – hardware wallets isolated from online threats. It’s a fortress of solitude for crypto, offering maximum security but requiring technical acumen. For the savvy investor or the privacy-centric individual, self-custody is best suited for those prioritizing absolute control over their digital assets. On-Exchange Custody: Convenience with a Catch The convenience of on-exchange custody cannot be overstated. Cryptocurrencies remain readily accessible, facilitating swift transactions. However, this method is not without its pitfalls—security is only as robust as the platform’s weakest link. Here lies a paradox: the more convenient the access, the greater the vulnerability. The collapse of FTX highlighted the potential vulnerabilities and the importance of selecting platforms with strong, transparent security practices and regulatory compliance. Advisors must thus choose platforms with military-grade security protocols, yet even the most fortified castles have fallen. Off-Exchange Solutions: Institutional Assurance For those managing substantial assets, off-exchange custody solutions represent a strategic chess move. This type of arrangement can include additional verification layers by involving a third party in the authorization of transactions, aligning with the stringent demands of institutional investors. It represents a strategic blend of old-world banking safety and new-tech efficiency. Investing in Crypto Quant Funds Venturing into crypto quant funds offers a compelling narrative. These funds utilize algorithms for high-frequency trading and other market-neutral strategies, potentially reducing risks through diversification and sophisticated strategies. This method can allow for diversified, long-term exposure to flagship cryptocurrencies while minimizing the typical complexities and risks associated with direct crypto asset management and custody. Navigating the Regulatory Landscape Advisors must also master the complexities of regulatory frameworks governing digital assets. The landscape is as politically nuanced as it is technologically advanced, requiring a judicious balance of compliance and strategic innovation. Concluding Thoughts In summary, integrating cryptocurrencies into investment portfolios requires a confluence of knowledge, strategic acumen and a keen understanding of risk. The paths of self-custody, on-exchange custody, and innovative off-exchange solutions offer diverse strategies that cater to different needs. Whether directly holding assets or investing in algorithmically driven funds, the key lies in leveraging these tools to achieve superior outcomes, reminiscent of digital assets’ ethos of bold, strategic innovation. - Todd Bendell, co-founder and managing partner, Amphibian Capital Q. What do credit fund managers look for when choosing a custodian for bitcoin collateral assets? Credit fund managers prioritize minimizing business risk when selecting a custodian for bitcoin collateral. Since bitcoin collateral is typically held for the duration of the loan, custodians are evaluated for their long-term viability, including their audit practices and business continuity plans. Safety is also a key concern; managers assess both general safety policies and specific procedures tailored to bitcoin, along with any additional services the custodian might offer. The biggest challenge in choosing a custodian is lack of standardization as many institutions retrofits traditional frameworks to include bitcoin programs. Q. How does custody of bitcoin collateral differ from traditional asset custody? While there are shared concerns like cybersecurity risks across both traditional and digital assets, bitcoin custody carries unique challenges. For example, the cyber risks associated with digital assets can potentially translate into physical risks through the unauthorized access to keys. Competent bitcoin custodians mitigate this risk by implementing robust key ceremony procedures, where the keys controlling the assets are distributed across multiple geographic locations with strict protocols governing their access and use. Q. Is it possible to insure bitcoin assets? Obtaining insurance for bitcoin assets is possible, though not commonly practiced among credit managers handling bitcoin collateral, similar to the lack of standard insurance policies for traditional financial assets. Instead, managers rely heavily on stringent security protocols and existing regulatory frameworks to protect these assets. - Meredith Yarbrough, Managing Partner, La Hoja Capital Partners LLC Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.

Web3’s underlying technologies are revolutionizing the future of sustainable energy markets through blockchain-powered peer-to-peer energy trading platforms and carbon-offsetting markets. In pursuing sustainability, web3 technologies have paved the way for inventive solutions to bolster climate-focused ventures, renewable energy programs, and initiatives to capture and store carbon. The recent decline of over 70% in the value of web3-related assets is indeed disconcerting. However, the focus should not be on their volatility. The fundamental technological advancements that have enabled web3 should be the highlight. These innovations are set to impact many sectors of the global economy and serve as a locomotive for reaching sustainability goals. BE[IN]CRYPTO Global Crypto and Web3 Sustainability Report Sustainable Growth & Reducing Climate Impact “Blockchain innovation and tokenized carbon credit have the potential to transform the way carbon is traded” The blockchain industry is taking urgent steps toward addressing climate change by promoting sustainability and reducing carbon emissions in multiple sectors. Blockchain can revolutionize the management of carbon credits, offsetting and measuring carbon footprints. Carbon trading is commonly used to meet international emissions reduction targets, including those outlined in the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement. Carbon credits also serve as certificates representing the right to emit one tonne of carbon dioxide or its equivalent. Under a carbon trading scheme, companies that emit less than their allocated carbon credits can sell their surplus credits to companies that exceed their emissions limit. This situation then creates a financial incentive for reducing emissions by putting a price on carbon. By offering a transparent, secure, and decentralized platform, blockchain facilitates the seamless integration and management of renewable energy sources. Allowing companies to account for carbon emissions precisely. As renewable energy sources become increasingly integrated into existing power grids, blockchain technology is critical in streamlining the process of bookkeeping emissions and green energy used by the single grid. A significant instance of this integration is the partnership between Energy Web Foundation (EWF) and Vodafone. In 2020, they launched a blockchain-focused energy management system to improve the integration of renewable and distributed energy assets within power grids. Utilizing secure IoT connectivity backed by blockchain technology, this system optimizes the energy market while fostering a more sustainable future. Blockchain-based decentralized carbon registries offer a transparent and impenetrable record of carbon credits, enhancing the efficiency and openness of the carbon market. For example, Powerledger has created the world’s first blockchain-based renewable energy trading platform. Allowing consumers and producers to monitor, trace, and trade every kilowatt generated off-grid. Simultaneously, it provides a trustworthy and secure platform for conducting carbon trading transactions. As we move into the next decade, web3 will play a crucial part in establishing trust in the carbon market and crafting a more dependable system for monitoring the ownership and exchange of carbon credits. Blockchain technology sets the stage for a more transparent, trustworthy, and eco-friendly carbon market. Blockchain technology is taking peer-to-peer energy trading to the next level. It’s changing how solar energy is traded among neighbors, businesses, and entities. By allowing direct energy trading, these platforms enable individuals and organizations to monetize excess solar power. They can also foster a more sustainable and decentralized energy market. Despite the existence of environmental credits, the current market structure creates friction. Veridium, an ecological tech startup, offers a solution to the issue through tokenization and smart contracts. The startup recently joined forces with IBM to use its technology to issue and manage carbon credit-backed blockchain tokens. Blockchain technology also allows households to combine solar energy production and battery storage. They then effectively operate as a cohesive virtual power plant. This approach empowers consumers to participate more actively in the energy market and promotes a greener and decentralized energy landscape. BE[IN]CRYPTO Global Crypto and Web3 Sustainability Report Sustainable Growth & Reducing Climate Impact The potential of web3 tools and blockchain technologies extends well beyond the realm of cryptocurrency’s volatile and often speculative market. To successfully navigate this shifting tide, it is essential to develop a comprehensive understanding of the transformative potential of the technology and its implications for the broader business landscape. Advocates of the carbon market will likely push for uniform global standards that provide increased assurance to market participants, fostering expansion in the process. The web3 industry has developed innovative methods for supporting climate-related initiatives, renewable energy projects, and carbon sequestration efforts. One potential solution to address the uncertainty created by changing policies and questions about the validity of certain credits is to digitalize the carbon credit market and remove intermediaries. Improving market transparency can also ensure investments are directed towards genuine sustainability initiatives. This could help boost the slowing growth of voluntary carbon markets.

179::https://blockworks.co/news/blockchain-audit-security-standards::Blockworks::article::Blockchain needs standards::Opinion: Without security audit standards, apps built on blockchain will continue to fall prey to hacks and exploits.::Without security audit standards, apps built on blockchain will continue to fall prey to hacks and exploits Frame Fusion Art/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks The 2023 crypto winter has been challenging for many, not least the thieves who target crypto wallets, platforms and token protocols. So far this year, they’ve only managed to steal $1 billion in crypto assets — a steep fall from 2022’s record $3.8 billion. Unfortunately, the decline appears to have more to do with a reduction in available capital than with stronger defenses. And while the scale of attacks has fallen, their frequency has in fact risen sharply: from 60 hacks in 2022 to 75 as of the end of October. And the year isn’t over. If decentralized finance is ever to be widely accepted by retail and institutional investors, then it needs to achieve its goal of democratizing global finance. We must collectively do better at closing the loopholes that malicious actors are forever looking to slip through. The key to locking the door against bad actors? We need to vastly improve security auditing, which, at present, is inconsistent at best and a rubber-stamp exercise at worst. Specifically, our industry as a whole needs to adopt a consistent auditing methodology for decentralized technology that is rigorous, standardized and repeatable — as robust as what protects traditional finance. Such an auditing standard, coupled with a public commitment by auditing firms to the principle of responsible disclosure — the willingness to call out projects that refuse to listen to or act on recommendations — will encourage projects themselves to raise their security standards. Atomic Wallet’s refusal to heed a February 2022 public disclosure of serious security vulnerabilities by auditor Least Authority resulted in the loss of more than $100 million to hackers in June 2023. At its best, a third-party security audit is a thorough investigation by a skilled team that analyzes every aspect of a system’s design and implementation, seeking out weaknesses and flaws that could affect operations or users — or offer bad actors access to sensitive data or assets. A good audit also carefully assesses whether developers and designers have adhered to best practices in a system’s creation and roll-out. Vulnerabilities come in many forms; incorrect or insufficiently secure cryptography, sensitive information leaks, unprotected system parts, inconsistencies between system design documentation and the code used in implementation. Weaknesses like these can result in anything from the exposure of sensitive and secret user data to the loss of user and system assets. That audits are as detailed — and consistent — as possible is therefore essential to both a project and its users’ safety. There are dozens of firms out there offering audit services, but with no industry standard, quality can and does indeed vary drastically. Even within reputable firms, there is neither consensus on what should be audited nor a consistent set of yardsticks. There is, of course, no guarantee that even the most experienced auditors will either sniff out every weakness in a system or protect every user from loss. But if they are thoroughly and regularly carried out, security audits have been proven to sharply reduce the risk of a serious vulnerability going undetected. Read more from our opinion section: It’s time for blockchain security firms to join forces However, audits can’t stop social engineering attacks — those that involve the manipulation of human beings — such as when North Korean group Lazarus convinced engineers at an unidentified crypto exchange earlier this year to download malware disguised as an arbitrage bot. Preventing that type of attack only comes from vigilance and team training. It is true that every audit will be different, just as every project is different. But my long experience in the security auditing space has taught me there are specific steps an auditor must take to maximize the effectiveness of the security audit for the benefit of clients, users and the ecosystem. What are these requirements? An auditing standard that aims to make decentralized systems more resilient and protect their users from potential losses must include an exhaustive assessment of the following: To ensure that any improvement in standards benefits blockchain as a whole, we also advocate knowledge-sharing and the creation of public goods such as research, tooling and training. By working together to improve the standards of the security auditing industry as a whole — and thus the decentralized technology sphere — we can go a long way toward stopping the blockchain black hat hackers from breaking 2022’s record for crypto assets stolen. And that’s one record we don’t want to see broken again. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. Subscribe to the Empire newsletter.

477::https://theconversation.com/quest-to-find-bitcoins-founder-highlights-currencys-biggest-threat-the-taxman-52411::The Conversation::article::Quest to find bitcoin’s founder highlights currency’s biggest threat: the taxman::How tax authorities decide to treat virtual currencies like bitcoin may determine whether they thrive or die.::Bitcoin enthusiasts have recently been roiled by claims that an Australian named Craig Wright and his deceased partner are the mysterious founders behind the cryptocurrency. Of course, we’ve been down this path before. The New York Times, Fast Company, The New Yorker and Newsweek have all made similar claims about different people, only to be proved wrong. And last month, Wired – the magazine behind the most recent claim – said there are reasons to believe Wright is actually a hoaxer and not “Satoshi Nakamoto,” as the currency’s creator is known. Regardless of whether the new claims are correct, it has resurrected a worry that has long plagued bitcoin users. Around one million bitcoins were mined early in the currency’s history and have never been transferred. Were they to be sold en masse, bitcoin’s value could drop precipitously, wiping out a lot of wealth and threatening its status as a reliable alternate currency, independent of banks and governments. However, the reporting about Wright and the bitcoin businesses and trusts he has established – presumably for tax and secrecy purposes – reveals an even bigger threat to bitcoin users and other supporters of virtual currency: how will such currencies be treated for tax purposes? This is a question I have been exploring for the last decade, both with regard to virtual currencies designed to be used solely online, such as for World of Warcraft, and those designed for use in the real world, such as bitcoin. Bitcoins are created by a computer algorithm and are initially allocated through a process colloquially referred to as “mining.” Miners collect bitcoins by solving complex mathematical equations used to authenticate transfers and in so doing both bring more of the currency into the world and maintain the system. Bitcoin users have a public key and a private key associated with the bitcoins they own. To effect a transfer, one must use the private key. However, transfers are recorded on a public “block chain,” which uses the associated public key. This secure public record-keeping obviates the need for third-party intermediaries, like banks. While the world can see the public key and how many bitcoins are associated with it, the owner of the bitcoin can remain anonymous if he keeps his association with that key secret. Approximately 15 million bitcoins have been issued to date, and they are currently valued at about US$430 each, for a total of approximately $6.5 billion. The algorithm is designed to generate 21 million bitcoins, and experts anticipate that the last bitcoin will be issued sometime between 2110 and 2140. Bitcoin is designed to be used as a currency, though some hold it as an investment. The difficulty is that governments have taken a variety of positions on the nature of bitcoin for tax purposes. For instance, some countries, including those in Europe, have classified bitcoin as a currency for consumption tax purposes, meaning that the various value-added taxes do not apply to bitcoin exchanges, while others, such as Australia, have not. Similarly, the U.K. treats bitcoin as foreign currency for income tax purposes, while the U.S. regards it as property. Those who “mine” bitcoins will likely be subject to income tax on the value they receive under the theory that they are being compensated for validating bitcoin transactions and maintaining the block chain that records all transfers. But this is true regardless of whether bitcoin is recognized as a currency. In other words, they are not really mining and not subject to the complex rules governing mining operations. Instead, they are being compensated for services. The difficulty arises when people try to spend their bitcoins, however acquired. Those who spend local currency, such as dollars (U.S. or Australian) or euros, do not report a gain or loss when they do so. For instance, if I buy a hamburger, I don’t have a gain or loss on the currency used, regardless of whether it has changed value relative to other currencies. As the baseline currency, a dollar is worth a dollar, even though it may fluctuate against other currencies or be affected by inflation. Foreign currency is different. If I buy a euro for $1 and spend it later, when it is worth $1.10, theoretically I have a $0.10 gain that I should be taxed on. Different countries have different rules, but in the U.S., taxpayers need not pay taxes on such gains if they are under $200 in a given year. By refusing to classify bitcoin as a currency for income tax purposes (local or otherwise), tax authorities effectively treat bitcoins as any other property, meaning that those who buy items with bitcoins must report any gain on the transaction associated with a change in its value. That is, it is treated like an investment, regardless of how the owner actually uses it. It is as if they sold their bitcoins for cash and then used that cash to make a purchase. Worse yet, if the bitcoin has gone down in value, taxpayers might not be able to deduct the losses, because they could be considered personal. Thus, anyone using bitcoin as a currency has to keep track of each bitcoin’s cost so that he can accurately calculate gain or loss. This administrative task, combined with the potential need to pay income taxes, could make bitcoin too difficult to use as an alternate currency. Wright’s tale of woe with the Australia Tax Authority (ATA) (revealed in a transcript made public as part of the effort to prove that he is Satoshi Nakamoto) shows how the decision not to classify bitcoin as a currency creates problems with a tax on goods and services (GST). Among other things, Wright sought to create an exchange to buy and sell bitcoin. If bitcoin were considered a currency, such exchanges would be exempt from the GST, and the exchange could operate economically. However, if the GST applied to such transactions, as the ATA claimed, the exchange would be forced to purchase $1 of bitcoin for $1.10 (assuming a 10% rate). In other words, if you use normal currency, it would cost you $1, but if you use bitcoin, it would cost $1.10. Bitcoin becomes a lot less attractive under those conditions. To avoid this result, Wright and his lawyers established a number of offshore trusts and argued that, for many of the transactions the ATA was investigating, no bitcoin was actually transferred. Instead, the beneficial interests in the trusts, which were not subject to the GST, were transferred. The bitcoin itself was purportedly held offshore, and any transfer of the bitcoin or rights to it were outside the reach of the ATA. It’s not clear whether such arguments would actually succeed, but they illustrate a real problem that intangible assets raise for both consumption and income taxes, especially for countries that use a territorial tax system (that is, one that doesn’t tax foreign income). If assets are considered to be outside a given country, they will not be subject to that country’s GST or equivalent tax. Moreover, if the asset can be “wrapped” in a trust or other entity whose ownership interests are exempt from the GST, it can potentially escape tax even if it is held locally. Similarly, if such assets generate income, for instance when they are bought or sold, under a territorial system, that income will be taxed in the country where the sale occurred. It is not surprising that Wright established at least some of his trusts in known tax havens, such as the Seychelles. Even if his efforts to shield bitcoin from tax through these efforts succeed, they are far too complicated for the average user and will likely further impede bitcoin’s adoption as an alternate currency. Much of the recent focus has been on whether Wright really created bitcoin and whether he is sitting on a hoard worth close to a half billion dollars, which could potentially destabilize the market. However, the real threat to bitcoin and other similar products may come from a far more mundane source: the world’s tax authorities. Absent favorable rulings, every bitcoin transaction could generate both income and consumption tax liability, rendering bitcoin impractical as an alternate currency. Sophisticated tax planning to avoid such outcomes might succeed but would make bitcoin harder to use. Thus, while bitcoin was developed as a means to free individuals from the need to interact with third parties, including the government, it nonetheless needs governmental cooperation if it is to move from the fringes to the mainstream.::2016-01-07T11:16:19Z::Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, Currencies, Global economy , Online currencies, Satoshi Nakamoto, Tax, Taxation, Virtual currencies::Adam Chodorow::Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/107461/original/image-20160106-14944-1b6iyfi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C177%2C1500%2C727&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

Bitcoin made some cautious gains on Wednesday ahead of the latest inflation data from the U.S. BTC is priced at $62,775 at the time of writing, up 1.8% in 24 hours. The wider digital market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), also ticked up, adding 0.55%. April's U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data is due at 08:30 ET, with expectations that it will show a 3.4% year-on-year increase, slower than March's 3.5%. Some analysts expect a softer-than-expected CPI reading could lift bitcoin above $65,000. Latest News: U.S. CPI Softer Than Expected at 0.3% in April; Bitcoin Rises to $63.7K Bitcoin's mean transaction fee has reversed the post-halving spike, squeezing miners' revenue. Miners earn revenue from two sources: block rewards and transaction fees. Miners receive a fixed amount of BTC as a reward for adding new blocks, along with transaction fees for including transactions in the blocks they mine. The spike, driven by the new Runes protocol, helped to compensate for the block reward being cut in half, but this proved to be short-lived. In response, miners may liquidate around $5 billion worth of BTC in the coming months, according to Markus Thielen, head of 10x Research. "Why would they keep inventory when the price is not going up?" Thielen said. Broker Canaccord Genuity expects Galaxy Digital's positive momentum to continue after the crypto financial services firm reported an increase in net income of 40% on Tuesday. Galaxy saw an increase in the number of trading counterparties with trading revenue rising 79%, Canaccord noted in a report, citing the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. as the major catalyst. Mike Novogratz’s firm also increased its proprietary mining hashrate and the Helios facility “presents an opportunity for Galaxy to pursue both mining and AI hosting over time,” the broker said. Galaxy's Toronto-listed shares fell 1.12% on Tuesday to close at C$12.41. - Omkar Godbole Edited by Sheldon Reback.

It all depends on…  Bitcoin recorded a notable hike recently, with gains of 4.9% seen over the past week. This uptick has contributed to a broader bullish trend across the cryptocurrency market. Analysts are now closely monitoring various indicators to predict what might lie ahead for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. One such analyst, Willy Woo, shared his insights on the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) Oscillator for Bitcoin, discussing its potential implications for future market movements. Woo’s analysis on the social media platform X delved into the VWAP, a technical indicator that averages the price of an asset while considering the volume of transactions at each price level. This approach gives more importance to price levels with higher trading volumes, providing a more balanced view of price movements.  For Bitcoin, Woo specifically examined the VWAP using on-chain volume, which benefits from the transparency of the blockchain to provide clear data to all observers. The focus of Woo’s study is the VWAP Oscillator, which measures the ratio between Bitcoin’s spot price and its VWAP, displaying this relationship in a form that oscillates around zero. Source: Willy Woo on X Recent trends revealed that the VWAP Oscillator has been in negative territory for the past few months, but is now on an upward trajectory. Should this continue, it could soon reach the neutral zone, signaling a potential shift in market dynamics. Historical data also seemed to indicate that when the VWAP Oscillator exits the negative zone and starts to climb, it often precedes a period of bullish momentum for Bitcoin. The price typically continues to surge until the oscillator peaks in positive territory and begins to decline. According to Woo, this pattern means that “there is still a lot of room to run before a reversal or consolidation occurs,” making it a challenging time for bearish investors in the market. Further supplementing these bullish observations, a CryptoQuant analyst also highlighted an increasing number of purchases from retail investors. According to the analyst, they have now bought roughly $135.7 million worth of Bitcoin over the past month alone. Source: CryptoQuant This buying spree aligns with a spike in Bitcoin’s daily active addresses, as shown by Santiment’s data. The number of daily active addresses surged from approximately 49,000 to over 66,000 in a single day, illustrating a significant hike in market activity. Source: Santiment From a technical analysis perspective too, Bitcoin’s chart on the 4-hour timeframe showed some promising signs. The appearance of a bullish abandoned baby pattern followed by a bullish engulfing candlestick that closes above its predecessor is a particularly positive bullish signal. Source: BTC/USDT, TradingView These technical patterns align with Woo’s prediction, indicating that Bitcoin might be gearing up for more gains. Notably, one of the catalysts behind BTC’s current bullishness is the release of the latest CPI data which was slightly lower than the expected 0.4%, as previously reported by AMBCrypto.

It is important to know the difference as there may be different trust assumptions associated with using one or the other. This guide covers the differences between tokens vs. coins and highlights recommended platforms for purchasing each. BeInCrypto chose the top platforms to purchase coins and tokens was thorough and conducted over a period of six months. Our criteria for the best platforms were safety, fees, availability, reputation, features, and assets offered. Many were considered, however, the platforms that scored the highest are: Here’s some insight into why each was selected. Coinbase As the most popular U.S based crypto brokerage and exchange, and perhaps second most popular exchange globally, Coinbase is one of the top options for purchasing cryptocurrency. The company is known for its adherence to compliance, which gives it a large degree of safety. Kraken Kraken is well known for its advanced trading features, user interface, and derivatives offerings. The exchange also has earning features which allows it to be more than just a simple trading platform. The highly secure CEX also offers NFT, margin and futures trading. eToro As a social trading platform, eToro allows users to copy trade successful traders. They can also enjoy other features outside of crypto, such as stocks and options. The app also supplies users with news, market insights, and advanced charts for more experienced traders. Binance As the largest exchange by trading volume, Binance is the preferred exchange for deep liquidity in many markets. The exchange also has an ultra low trading fee of 0.1%. Binance is considered an all-in-one exchange, as it has multiple features for many types of crypto activities. YouHodler YouHolder is an E.U. based exchange that serves customers in multiple regions. It is perhaps known for its earning features which allows customers to deposit crypto and earn interest in return. Users can also take out loans using crypto as collateral on YouHodler. This methodology was peer-reviewed and fact checked to ensure accuracy. To learn more about BeInCrypto’s Verification Process, click the following link. In cryptocurrency, coins are digital assets native to a blockchain. Put another way, they are assets built into the blockchain itself rather than on top of the blockchain. We can think of this in terms of nations. The native currency for the United States is the United States Dollar (USD), the British Pound Sterling (GBP) for the United Kingdom, and the Euro (EURO) for the Eurozone. Similarly, the native cryptocurrency for the Bitcoin blockchain is Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) for Ethereum, and Solana (SOL) for the Solana blockchain. Let’s take this further. The U.S. Department of the Treasury issues seven denominations of paper currency ($1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100) and five denominations of coins (1¢, 5¢, 10¢, 25¢, 50¢). In the same way, cryptocurrency coins have several denominations as well. There are two popular methods for creating a blockchain’s native coins — UTXO (unspent transaction output) and the account model. While cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Litecoin use the UTXO model, other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and the BNB chain use the account model. A UTXO is created when a transaction occurs. When miners mine a block, they make a Coinbase or a transaction to pay themselves for updating the blockchain. A coinbase transaction is the first transaction in a block a miner creates. When a transaction output is created, it becomes a UTXO until it is spent. Each UTXO contains information about its value (e.g., how many coins it represents). Once created, the outputs can only be used once as input in a new transaction. Two types of record-keeping models are popular in today’s blockchain networks. The first method is the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) Model and the second one is the Account/Balance Model. The UTXO model is employed by Bitcoin, and Ethereum uses the Account/Balance Model. pic.twitter.com/HEEzlMViVF This is similar to a transaction made in coins or bills. A UTXO is like a coin or bill itself, while the bill’s value can vary, similar to how the value of a UTXO can vary. Once spent, you can not retrieve the bill you used to pay once, just like UTXOs can only be used once. The buyer receives any change left over from the transaction. Another UTXO is created and sent to the recipient when a UTXO is spent. If the original UTXO exceeds the amount sent, a second UTXO is made, and the sender receives the remainder via a change address. Each UTXO must reference a previous UTXO as its input, except for special cases like coinbase transactions where new coins are minted. This creates a chain of custody from one UTXO to another based on the history of transactions. You can trace a UTXO back to the transaction where it was created as an output. While the UTXO model records transactions in a way that is similar to transacting with bills and coins, the account model is similar to traditional banking. In this model, accounts hold balances that increase or decrease with each transaction. When you send a transaction, the blockchain directly adjusts the accounts’ balances. It also debits the amount from the sender’s account and credits the same amount to the recipient. As a result, the coins technically are not “sent.” Rather, there is a ledger that updates with each transaction. Another important detail to keep in mind is the account nonce. The account nonce is simply an index of the number of successful transactions of a single account. It ensures that transactions from a single account are processed in the order they are sent. This is important for maintaining the state consistency of the account, such as the balance of Ether. The term nonce (number used once) is used quite frequently in crypto and tech-related fields. “Account nonces” have a separate purpose from nonces in blockchain mining, message authentication codes (MAC), and other systems. Blockchains are distributed databases requiring a network of nodes to maintain all the data it stores. The nodes are computers or servers maintained by individuals or organizations. However, keeping these databases comes at a cost. Unlike Amazon Web Service or Microsoft Azure, the database (or blockchain) nodes are anonymous and distributed globally. Therefore, paying these node operators for their work in a fiat currency is impossible. When a block is created, the node that mines or proposes the block receives a coinbase or a stipend for maintaining this distributed database. Another reason that coins exist is to pay gas and transaction fees. When you create a transaction on a blockchain, a node must pick up your transaction and expend resources to execute it. A transaction fee is paid to the miner or proposer (validator) that executes the transaction. Alternatively, gas fees are the cost to execute the transaction, and transaction fees are the cost to pay the miner or validator to execute the transaction. Users pay both transaction and gas fees in coins. 1. Bitcoin (BTC): Created by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency. While Bitcoin was designed as a medium of exchange, it has since found a stronger use as a store of value. 2. Ether (ETH): Ether is the native cryptocurrency to the Ethereum blockchain. It is used as gas for the Ethereum virtual machine, which allows developers to create applications with some level of complexity. 3. Solana (SOL): As the native coin of the Solana network, SOL is used as payment for gas and transaction fees — which are extremely low on Solana. The smallest unit of SOL is a Lamport, named after Leslie Lamport. 4. Avalanche (AVAX): Avalanche is a layer-0 protocol that uses the AVAX coin as its native crypto. On Avalanche, users can launch subnets using their own nodes. 5. Cosmos (ATOM): Cosmos is a hub allowing founders to create blockchains using the IBC. This enables blockchains to communicate, share information, and transfer assets like ATOM securely and standardized. Unlike coins, developers do not build cryptocurrency tokens directly into the blockchain. Instead, they create tokens as cryptocurrencies using smart contracts on a blockchain. The logic for what “qualifies” as a token and governs its behavior depends entirely on the developer that creates it. With most blockchains today, the network does not recognize the tokens built on it. A few blockchains like Sui and Aptos offer rare exceptions to this rule. As such, some communities have developed token standards specific to their blockchain ecosystem. Token standards govern how accounts are updated. Some of the logic that they manage includes: Perhaps the most popular token standard is the ERC-20 standard for the Ethereum ecosystem and EVM-compatible chains. There is also the BEP-20 standard for the BNB chain, SPL (Solana Program Library) for Solana, and, more recently, the BRC-20 standard for Bitcoin. The concept of tokens is not specific to cryptocurrency. Many examples of tokens exist in the real world. In this case, a token is just a physical representation of some right or privilege. For example, you could consider the deed to a house or the title to a car as a token or proof of ownership of those assets. Tokenization is the digital representation of rights and privileges. In the case of tokens created by smart contracts, the token represents the right to transact value. Aside from the standard logic, tokens work in many different ways. Founders typically create tokens with a purpose in mind and will tailor their behavior to the decentralized application (DApp) or ecosystem in which it will operate. Many have attempted to create frameworks for classifying token logic. This is quite the herculean feat, considering that they are as diverse as the developer is imaginative. In the case of ERC-20 tokens, the logic for the token exists completely within the smart contract. So technically, addresses on Ethereum do not actually “hold” tokens. Rather, the smart contract is like a ledger for an accountant. It keeps a record of the balances of each address that owns tokens. When someone “sends” tokens to another address, the smart contract updates the balance of both addresses. That is why it is important to create tokens using well-tested standards and best practices. Unless developers are careful, a hacker could game poorly formed token logic. As stated previously, many have attempted to create standards for classifying tokens. This is difficult, considering tokens gain new use cases every year. The most popular uses for tokens are: 1. Chainlink (LINK): Chainlink is most notably known for its blockchain-agnostic oracle services. The team behind Chainlink also creates infrastructure for cross-chain communication, bridging, verifiable randomness, and more. 2. The Graph (GRT): Often described as the Google of web3, The Graph is a protocol for indexing information stored on the blockchain. It allows users to query, publish, and use public data to build applications. GRT: The Graph: The Graph is a decentralized protocol that allows developers to index, query, and access blockchain data in a scalable and efficient manner. $PIXIZ | $BAMA | #Bitbama | #R2E. 3. Render (RNDR): Render is a project that allows users to transact in a GPU marketplace. Sellers can rent out their GPU power while buyers utilize it for graphic rendering tasks. 4. Uniswap (UNI): Uniswap is Ethereum’s most popular decentralized exchange (DEX). The UNI token gives its holders governance rights over the protocol. 5. Gala (GALA): Gala Games is a blockchain-based gaming platform that lets players own, develop, and trade in-game assets with cryptocurrency. Here’s a comparison chart that outlines the key differences between crypto coins and tokens. This chart helps to delineate the differences between crypto coins and tokens, portraying how they are used, where they operate, and their characteristics in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. You can compare coins and tokens to currency in traditional finance (TradFi) in many ways. From an accounting perspective, the ledger that records and issues the currency is centralized in trades, decentralized with coins, and depends on tokens. In traditional finance, there are different forms of money because of the system’s complexity. For example, USD can come in bank deposits, fiat (e.g., bills and coins), treasuries (e.g., bonds, notes, etc.), and central bank notes. “When most people think of money, they picture rectangular pieces of government-printed paper, known as fiat currency, decorated with historical figures. Although it is the most well-known form of money, it is only a small part of what constitutes money in the modern financial system.” This complexity complicates the ledger; however, at the end of the day, the system is mostly centralized under the U.S. government. On the other hand, coins built on blockchains are part of a decentralized ledger that is maintained by a global community. In the case of USD, the U.S. government can sanction any country to prevent it from using dollars. With a blockchain, anyone has the right to update the ledger (mint more coins), but no one can exclude anyone else from doing so or transacting. However, tokens do not necessarily have this ability. It all depends on the smart contract itself. Despite the name, stablecoins are primarily tokens. Developers create stablecoins on vetted and seasoned blockchains. This makes them tokens. The reason is that mature blockchains already have the infrastructure for users to utilize stablecoins. If stablecoin providers had to build their blockchains to issue coins, they would also have to find a way to attract developers to build apps on their blockchain or the applications themselves. Both of these options are extremely costly. There could also be significant ramifications if these providers built their own blockchains and bridged the stablecoins to other ecosystems. This comparison between crypto coins and tokens highlights substantial differences between asset types. You must thoroughly research and understand these distinctions for safe trading practices. Staying well-informed will empower you to navigate the cryptocurrency sector safely and effectively. Coins are cryptocurrencies that have their blockchain. Tokens are built on blockchains but do not have their own. They are simply smart contracts that exist outside of the source code of a blockchain. Ethereum is a blockchain. The native coin of Ethereum is Ether. Though many cryptocurrencies exist on Ethereum, their logic is not built into the source code of Ethereum. Tokens are useful for utilizing services on decentralized applications (DApps). For example, traders can not use native Ether in many applications on Ethereum. They must use Wrapped Ether (WETH), a tokenized (smart contract) version of Ether. There are many different classifications for tokens. Utility, governance, security, non-fungible, and transactional are the most common. Tokens are often difficult to classify because their uses and purposes grow with time. Tokens are not a phenomenon specific to cryptocurrency. They also exist in the traditional world. For example, a deed to a house or car title could be considered a token. Examples of tokens include Chainlink (LINK), the Graph (GRT), and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Nearly all stablecoins and most meme coins are also tokens, except Dogecoin. Cryptocurrencies like ETH, BTC, and AVAX are not tokens because their logic is built into the blockchain. However, wrapped versions of these tokens (e.g., WETH, WBTC, and WAVAX) are considered tokens.

481::https://blockworks.co/news/blockchains-still-arent-great-at-communication::Blockworks::article::Blockchains still aren’t great at communication::Opinion: The current state of blockchain interoperability poses an existential threat to the mainstream adoption of blockchain as a whole.::The current state of blockchain interoperability poses an existential threat to the mainstream adoption of blockchain technology as a whole Midjourney modified by Blockworks One of the prerequisites for the mass adoption of blockchain technology is interoperability — the ability to pass data between distinct blockchain and blockchain-like systems. Numerous interoperability projects have established themselves today, and many are growing at an incredible rate. Indeed, it’s only a matter of time before the number of cross-chain messages is measured in trillions. Blockchain interoperability has never been more ubiquitous. In January 2024, more than $23 billion worth of assets were locked in cross-chain bridges on Ethereum alone. Clearly, our industry’s early adopters — affectionately called Web3 enthusiasts — are keen to explore new ecosystems as they routinely bridge assets from one blockchain to another. This process, though clunky, has become so commonplace that many believe that blockchain interoperability is a solved issue. The truth is far more bleak. The state of blockchain interoperability today is one of fractured incompatibility. Competing interoperability projects build ad hoc solutions that gerrymander the blockchain landscape, making it impractical for enterprises and regulators to vet the security of each. As it stands, the current state of blockchain interoperability poses an existential threat to the mainstream adoption of blockchain technology as a whole. Modern interoperability projects are far too focused on building and growing their own proprietary products. The fight to become the one-and-only has introduced growing system complexity and, therefore, unbounded risk. As different projects make different tradeoffs to solve different problems, blockchain interoperability protocols continue to increase in complexity. Not only does this complexity make protocols progressively more incompatible with one another, each new system component or trust assumption introduces new attack vectors. As an industry, we must curb this troubling trend. A shared framework for interoperability is desperately needed. As a trustless system, decentralized blockchains are incapable of communicating with other blockchain networks out-of-the-box. Trust assumptions dictate the risk profile of a particular cross-chain design by shaping its vulnerabilities and delineating how a system can be exploited. Generally speaking, the greater the complexity of a system, the higher its susceptibility to attack. It is therefore preferable to simplify the design of cross-chain solutions in order to limit the number of exploitable components. So, while it is true that trust assumptions are inherent to blockchain interoperability solutions, there is security in simplicity. Read more from our opinion section: There’s no reason to fear open platforms A shared framework for interoperability between blockchain and blockchain-like systems — one that includes architectural guidelines and vetted interface definitions — makes it possible to reduce system complexity. This has the knock-on effect of preventing fragmentation across different project implementations. Even something as simple as common interfaces and functions to decode and verify the validity of messages would go a long way towards enhancing interoperability, while reducing the need for custom implementations. A shared framework for interoperability also has the potential to foster collaboration between different interoperability projects. Broadly speaking, interoperability projects simply don’t trust each others’ work. This isn’t entirely surprising considering that, between 2021 and 2023, more than $2.9 billion was stolen from exploited cross-chain bridges. Nevertheless, this distrust has directly contributed to the fractured state of blockchain interoperability today. A shared framework, built openly and vetted by all, will result in a more secure system. Blockchain interoperability must be core infrastructure first, product second. If we as an industry are to have any hope of achieving the mainstream adoption of blockchain technology (without sacrificing the industry’s core ethos of decentralization), we must establish a shared framework for interoperability.

484::https://theconversation.com/demystifying-the-blockchain-a-basic-user-guide-60226::The Conversation::article::Demystifying the blockchain: a basic user guide::Multiple use cases for the blockchain are currently being tested, so it’s worth learning the basics.::Companies around the world are exploring blockchain, the technology underpinning digital currency bitcoin. In this Blockchain unleashed series, we investigate the many possible use cases for the blockchain, from the novel to the transformative. Most people agree we do not need to know how a television works to enjoy using one. This is true of many existing and emerging technologies. Most of us happily drive cars, use mobile phones and send emails without knowing how they work. With this in mind, here is a tech-free user guide to the blockchain - the technology infrastructure behind bitcoin, and many other emerging platforms. What does the blockchain do? The blockchain is software that stores and transfers value or data across the internet. What can I store and transfer using the blockchain? To use the blockchain, you will need to set up an account or address (a virtual wallet). At this time, the most popular use for the blockchain is to make micro-payments with virtual currencies. For example, you can buy bitcoin with real money and then spend it on the internet using the blockchain. Authorising a payment using the blockchain is similar to using a credit card to buy something online. Instead of a 16-digit credit card number, you provide the vendor with a unique string of numbers and letters generated for each transaction. With this unique identifier, the blockchain can verify and authenticate the transaction. Can I use the blockchain to transfer real money? Not yet. Some companies are using the blockchain to make international financial transfers, but most of these transactions are enabled by bitcoin or other digital currencies. Exchanging real money for bitcoin incurs fees for the sender, but the benefit is speed, security and convenience. How is transferring value or virtual currency on the blockchain different from transferring money from my bank account? Depending on the amount and the destination, when you transfer money from your bank account, your bank will limit the amount you can transfer. Most banks impose daily limits for all transactions. When you use virtual money on the blockchain, there are no limits. When you transfer value or currency from your bank account to an account with a different bank or other financial institution, the transfer can take days. When you use the blockchain, the transfer is immediate. If a transfer from your bank account puts your account into debit, your bank will charge you a fee. The blockchain will not allow a transfer in excess of your balance and so your virtual wallet will never be in debit. How is storing value using the blockchain different from keeping my money in a bank account? Bank accounts and credit cards are vulnerable to attack from fraudsters and hackers. The blockchain is a more secure way to store and transfer funds, particularly if you keep a modest value in your virtual wallet. Hacking the blockchain is difficult, time-consuming and expensive. No one breaks into Fort Knox for just $500. Of course, value stored on the blockchain will not earn you interest or improve your credit rating; and the blockchain will not lend you money to buy a house or car. The blockchain does not replace your bank, but very soon banks will be using the blockchain too. How is transferring data using the blockchain different to attaching a file to an email? Unlike emails with attachments, the blockchain enables the immediate transfer of data no matter how big the file. Also, there is less danger of spam or viruses and no need for firewalls or junk folders. How is storing data using the blockchain different to storing my files on my computer? If you lose or break your computer or if it is attacked by a hacker or virus, you could lose that data. The blockchain resides in the cloud. Like any web-based storage, you just need your username and password to access your data from anywhere anytime. What else can I use the blockchain for? Very soon the blockchain will be used for online transactions. It will enable smart contracts, crowdfunding and auctions. It will verify the provenance of artworks and diamonds; transfer title to real estate and other assets; and store information about people, products and property. Apps for music distribution, sports betting and a new type of financial auditing are also being tested. Why is the blockchain described as “riskless”? The blockchain verifies and authenticates both ends of each transaction. It will not release a purchaser’s funds until it has checked that the vendor will deliver as promised. Is the blockchain safe? Standards and regulations are needed so that the technology can be readily used across different organisations, industries and jurisdictions. Blockchains can be private (like an email) or public (like Facebook), so users need to know which type is being operated before joining a new blockchain. My tips for safe use of the blockchain are: keep your virtual wallet details secure; do not let an unknown third party hold virtual currency or data for you; and do not provide your online banking details to anyone. As seen in a recent attack on a crowdfunding project, the blockchain is at its most vulnerable when significant value is stored in a single address. The blockchain may be trustworthy, but the people on it might not be.::2016-07-12T19:45:43Z::Banking, Bitcoin, Blockchain, Blockchain unleashed, Crowdfunding, Cryptocurrency, Smart contract::Philippa Ryan::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/124654/original/image-20160531-1923-4sw0cj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=13%2C10%2C986%2C479&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
485::https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/02/07/diversifying-stability-stablecoins-finding-home-beyond-the-greenback/::CoinDesk::article::Diversifying Stability: Stablecoins Finding Home Beyond the Greenback::Following the success of Tether and USDC, a generation of stablecoins are offering new features for investors and holders, says Scott Sunshine, Managing Partner of Blue Dot Advisors.::Stablecoins, the backbone of the cryptocurrency market, with their $135 billion market cap, have traditionally been pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, offering stability and liquidity in a somewhat volatile ecosystem. Now, the landscape of stablecoins is evolving, with innovative projects emerging that look beyond conventional USD pegs. These new stablecoins are tethered to alternative assets like commodities, real estate, or even diversified baskets of cryptocurrencies, introducing a fresh perspective on stability and risk management within the digital asset domain. While USD-pegged stablecoins like tether (USDT) and USDC dominate the market, they are subject to the fluctuations and vulnerabilities of the U.S. dollar. In contrast, stablecoins tied to alternative assets offer diversification benefits and reduced exposure to currency risk. Commodity-backed stablecoins, for example, are pegged to the value of underlying commodities such as gold, silver, or oil, providing intrinsic value and hedging against inflationary pressures.

Real estate-backed stablecoins leverage the stability and appreciation potential of tangible assets, allowing investors to access fractional ownership in properties worldwide. These stablecoins are backed by real estate portfolios, offering liquidity and diversification in an asset class traditionally characterized by illiquidity and high barriers to entry. Another groundbreaking approach is stablecoins tied to a basket of cryptocurrencies, like DAI and wrapped bitcoin, offer stability while capturing the potential upside of the digital asset market. These diversified stablecoins mitigate single-currency risk and provide exposure to a broader spectrum of cryptocurrencies, reducing volatility and enhancing portfolio resilience. The emergence of stablecoins beyond USD pegs reflects a maturing market and growing investor demand for stability, transparency, and diversification in digital assets. These alternative stablecoins offer a compelling value proposition for investors seeking to preserve capital and navigate the dynamic cryptocurrency landscape with confidence. In emerging markets, for example, with unstable local currencies, stablecoins provide a reliable alternative to traditional dollars, facilitating cross-border transactions and financial inclusion. Not all stablecoins, however, deliver on their promise of stability and liquidity. In mid-2022, TerraUSD was de-pegged, losing its value, simultaneously crashing the price of its sister coin, Luna. In a matter of days, both coins quickly became worthless, wiping billions of dollars off the cryptocurrency markets. Despite their potential benefits, alternative stablecoins face regulatory scrutiny, liquidity challenges, and valuation complexities. Regulatory frameworks governing commodity-backed stablecoins and real estate-backed stablecoins vary across jurisdictions, requiring robust compliance measures and legal frameworks to ensure investor protection and compliance. Moreover, the liquidity of alternative stablecoins may be limited compared to USD-pegged stablecoins, posing challenges for trading and market adoption. Valuation methodologies for alternative assets can also be complex and opaque, requiring transparency and independent audits to instill investor trust and confidence. In conclusion, stablecoin innovations beyond USD pegs represent a significant paradigm shift in the cryptocurrency market, offering investors new avenues for stability, diversification, and risk management. While challenges remain, the growing adoption and maturation of alternative stablecoins signal a transformative shift toward a more resilient and inclusive digital asset ecosystem.

487::https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-halving-effect-on-microstrategy-stock::Blockworks::article::What analysts say the Bitcoin halving is set to do for MicroStrategy stock::One analyst nearly doubled his price target for MicroStrategy stock on Monday as industry watchers anticipate upward price action.::The publicly traded hoarder of bitcoin could hold close to 300,000 BTC by the end of 2025, the Benchmark Company’s Mark Palmer predicts Wirestock Creators/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks One analyst nearly doubled his price target for MicroStrategy stock on Monday as industry watchers anticipate upward price action in the months after the imminent Bitcoin halving. Mark Palmer, a senior equity research analyst for The Benchmark Company, said in a Monday research note that he had raised his price target for MicroStrategy (MSTR) to $1,875 per share. The new mark is nearly double that of his $990 price target set for MSTR on Feb. 27. Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to an all-time high above $69,000 about a week later, and would reach new heights after that. MicroStrategy’s stock price stood at $1,538 at 12:30 pm ET Monday — up 125% year to date and 8% higher than a month ago. The $1,875 price target assumes bitcoin’s price rising to $150,000 by the end of 2025, Palmer wrote in the note. It stands above a $1,450 MicroStrategy price target made by TD Cowen analysts on March 20, a target that has not been revised since. Read more: Cheatsheet: MicroStrategy has now outperformed Nvidia this year The Bitcoin halving — when per-block rewards to bitcoin miners will drop from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC — is scheduled to occur in less than two weeks. While the upcoming Bitcoin halving, like previous ones, is set to create a “supply shock,” the impact of this halving could be magnified given the demand for spot bitcoin ETFs, Palmer added. The 11 US spot bitcoin ETFs held roughly 827,000 BTC as of April 3, according to BitMEX Research data. The fund category has notched net inflows of more than $12 billion since such offerings launched on Jan. 11. “We expect the inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs to grow dramatically once institutions begin to invest in them in earnest,” Palmer wrote. Industry watchers have pointed to the historical upward trend of BTC after Bitcoin halvings. Read more: BTC price dips after all-time high. Where is it headed next? Analysts at crypto exchange Bitfinex said in a Monday report that they — similar to Palmer — expect bitcoin to see a 160% post-halving price surge to above $150,000 in the next 14 months. The Bitfinex analysts noted, however, that bitcoin achieving an all-time high ahead of this halving is an anomaly that “introduces a level of uncertainty into the market dynamics.” “If the price of bitcoin rises after the halving, we would expect MicroStrategy to remain correlated with that price action,” said Dan Weiskopf, co-portfolio manager of the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK). MicroStrategy has increased its bitcoin holdings for 15 consecutive quarters, Palmer noted. He expects the company to continue collecting BTC using proceeds from capital markets transactions and excess cash generated by its enterprise software business. The company held 214,246 BTC as of March 19. It most recently bought more than 9,000 BTC last month after proposing an offering of $500 million in convertible senior notes due in 2031. Read more: Who’s the better bitcoin salesman: Larry Fink or Michael Saylor? Palmer said he estimates that MicroStrategy will hold 298,246 bitcoin by the end of 2025. This would represent a nearly 40% increase from its current bitcoin stack. Lance Vitanza, managing director of equity research at TD Cowen, told Blockworks last year that he expects MicroStrategy to continue buying BTC when market conditions are attractive — based on BTC price and the price at which MicroStrategy can issue debt or equity securities. Vitanza said in a March 20 research note that, given a $1.25 billion valuation of MicroStrategy’s operating software business, the market was imputing a 90% premium to the value of the company’s bitcoin holdings. “Ultimately, we expect that any future contraction in the company’s bitcoin premium will over time be more than offset by a corresponding increase in the underlying price of bitcoin, as the seasoning of new ETPs continues to drive incremental bitcoin demand at the same time incremental supply of bitcoin falls by 50% due the halving of the bitcoin block reward expected this coming April,” Vitanza wrote at the time. The premium valuation that the stock trades at presents an advantage for the company to continue to buy bitcoin on accretive basis, Weiskopf told Blockworks. “After the quarter is reported, we would expect further convertible bond issuance since borrowing at less than 1% and selling stock through a convertible [note] with an additional premium over enterprise value is even more accretive than simply selling stock through an [at-the-market offering],” he added. The stock trading at a premium to its net asset value is supported by several factors, Palmer argued. “The most impactful of these is MSTR’s demonstrated ability to tap the capital markets at very attractive interest rates — the two convertible debt offerings the company executed during March had coupons of 0.625% and 0.875% — and then use the proceeds to purchase more bitcoin,” he said.

Its primary objective is to offer a versatile and expandable blockchain platform that facilitates the execution of smart contracts. This platform opens the doors to a diverse array of decentralized financial applications, innovative cryptocurrency tokens, captivating games, and various other possibilities for development. Established in 2015, Cardano has emerged as a prominent player among global cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization.Cardano’s associated cryptocurrency is actually called ADA, but many people use ADA and Cardano interchangeably. Cardano’s coin is named after Ada Lovelace, a 19th-century mathematician known as the first computer programmer. In 2021, Cardano made significant progress by introducing smart contract support through its Alonzo update. This testnet update marked the initial step in delivering the anticipated scalability and diverse applications to Cardano users. With this update, users gained the ability to develop smart contracts, create non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and manage multiple assets. Subsequent releases and forks are expected to further enhance the mainnet by introducing additional smart contract functionalities and expanding its capabilities. Bitcoin and Cardano exhibit distinct differences in their design and functionality. While Bitcoin was primarily developed as a peer-to-peer payment system, Cardano encompasses an entire ecosystem that enables developers to create tokens, decentralized applications (dApps), and various other use cases on a scalable blockchain network. One significant difference lies in their consensus mechanisms. Cardano employs a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) approach, whereas Bitcoin relies on a competitive mining process that rewards participants with the cryptocurrency. By utilizing PoS, Cardano minimizes energy consumption and waste by eliminating the need for power-intensive mining rigs. Instead, Cardano users can install compatible wallet software on their computers or devices, stake their Ada (Cardano’s cryptocurrency), and actively participate in the network to earn rewards. This unique approach allows Cardano to reduce its environmental impact while providing users with the opportunity to contribute to the network and earn incentives through staking their Ada. Cardano boasts a notable advantage in transaction processing speed compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum 1.0, often referred to as Classic Ethereum. With the capacity to handle over 250 transactions per second (TPS), Cardano surpasses the transaction throughput of Bitcoin, which is approximately 4.6 TPS, as well as Ethereum 1.0, which typically ranges between 15 and 45 TPS. This impressive transaction processing capability positions the Cardano network as highly scalable and efficient in facilitating a large volume of transactions. Cardano is significantly more environmentally friendly than Bitcoin, claiming to be 1.6 million times more energy-efficient. Please note that the following statement is our opinion and should not be considered financial advice. Cardano looks well-positioned to reach its full potential in the coming years. If Cardano successfully boosts market sentiment among crypto enthusiasts, ADA crypto price could continue to rise for the next five years. As per our Cardano price prediction 2023, ADA coin is expected to reach a possible high of $0.72 by the end of 2023. We forecast a minimum price of $0.27 and an average price of $0.41 for the year. In the long term, we expect the price of cryptocurrency to grow systematically. By 2025, the price growth is expected to be more than 60% of the current price. We believe that Ada is a good investment and will continue to grow in the long term, with the possibility of periodic price declines.  More: What is Solana? Is it good investment in 2023?

Share this article E-commerce firm eBay may be rethinking its NFT and Web3 strategy after reportedly laying off over 30% of its Web3 division staff. According to an initial report from NFT news platform NFTgators, sources indicate that several employees “involved with Web3” operations have recently left the organization. The move comes after eBay acquired Manchester-based NFT marketplace KnownOrigin in June 2022, whose team and IP became part of the company’s Web3 division. Before this acquisition, eBay had a concurrent partnership with OneOf, a Web3 firm working with music NFTs. eBay later acquired TCGplayer for $295 million to expand its digital collectibles business. The report also highlights that Stef Jay, eBay’s business and strategy officer for the Web3 division, has resigned. David Moore, a founder from KnownOrigin, has also reportedly been made redundant (dismissed), although it was not clarified whether this was an individual redundancy case or a collective one. According to NFTgator’s source, KnownOrigin and eBay had a falling out, with the latter halting all plans for NFTs and other types of digital collectibles on its platform. “Many within the company are unhappy, blaming the lack of leadership and strategy for the layoffs. There are internal criticisms, even at senior levels, questioning the qualifications of the current head of web3 as well as eBay’s strategy team,” the source states. The crypto bear market for the past couple of years has heavily impacted interest and sales in NFTs. However, newer collections, such as Pudgy Penguins, Mutant Ape Yacht Club, Moonbirds, Mad Lads, and Quantum Cats, among others, have seen renewed interest. Bitcoin Ordinals have also been gaining traction since their introduction in mid-December last year. According to data from Forbes, the global NFT market cap has reached roughly $50 billion, with a $46 million trading volume in the past 24 hours. Despite these developments, it appears that eBay is either doing a strategy pivot or is simply reorganizing its Web3 initiatives in a leaner direction. The company has not publicly acknowledged or confirmed the reasons for these changes.

Bitcoin functions as a form of digital cash; really, it is a technology, using cryptography to ensure the validity of transactions and periodically generate new bitcoins. Bitcoin has grown into an industry now worth more than US$6 billion. Last week, the ATO published long-awaited guidance on the Australian tax treatment of bitcoin, in the form of draft rulings regarding income tax, Goods and Services Tax and Fringe Benefits Tax. The ATO’s position is that bitcoin is property. So bitcoin’s tax treatment for income tax, GST, and FBT, follows that of a valuable commodity such as gold or shares. Where bitcoins are exchanged for other property or services, this is treated as a barter transaction. Both the supply of bitcoin and the AUD (Australian dollar) value of the property received may be taxable. Where a taxpayer holds bitcoin as an investment, capital gains tax (CGT) may apply to gains or losses made on the disposal of the bitcoin. This requires the taxpayer to track the purchase and sale price of bitcoin in Australian dollars. If the transaction remains under the A$10,000 CGT personal-use threshold, individuals who use bitcoin to purchase goods or services for personal use will not be subject to CGT. Equally, individuals are not required to report or collect GST when using bitcoin to purchase items for personal consumption. However, businesses will be taxable where bitcoin is received as payment for an ordinary business transaction, as the business must report as income the AUD value of the bitcoin received. Where bitcoin is paid to an employee, it is a property fringe benefit and FBT may apply to its AUD value. And if a business acquires and exchanges bitcoin in the ordinary course of business, the bitcoin is treated as trading stock. The ATO says bitcoin mining can be a business, depending on the scale and nature of the bitcoin operations. Mining could be treated as generating services income, as miners verify the validity of bitcoin transactions; but if bitcoin is really an intangible commodity, perhaps this is a business of acquiring or producing that commodity itself. The CGT treatment of bitcoin means bitcoins are not fungible. For example, over time, a business or investor acquires three bitcoins for a cost of $100, $500, and $1000 respectively. Later, one bitcoin is valued at $500, and the business wishes to use one bitcoin to pay for a $500 transaction. This could generate very different tax consequences depending on which bitcoin is sold: a taxable gain, a loss, or no net tax. This produces tax planning opportunities, as for other investments such as shares. Valuing bitcoin is difficult as it has “no intrinsic value” (as noted in an OECD working paper). It is also highly volatile. Determining market value at receipt and disposal of each bitcoin will result in administrative costs. GST will apply to a supply of bitcoin by a registered business and it is not treated as an input-taxed financial supply or as money. When bitcoin is used in a transaction with another business, two GST events occur: the supply of the product and the supply of the bitcoin. If cash were used, GST would be charged only on the product. While a business purchaser is entitled to an input credit for both the bitcoin and product supplies, this approach presents a commercial disincentive for using bitcoin as a means of exchange compared to Australian dollars. It is likely to be more costly and difficult for businesses to reuse bitcoin in business-to-business transactions. The ATO’s approach is broadly consistent with the tax rulings issued to date by many other countries. US IRS guidance issued in March this year acknowledged bitcoin is a “convertible virtual currency” but states that for tax purposes it should be treated as property. Since then, a range of software has been created that helps automatically complete administrative tasks like valuing bitcoin. But other countries have taken a more flexible view. The UK has avoided giving a blanket tax classification to bitcoin, instead stating tax rules would be applied depending on the facts. HMRC guidance also notes that, given their volatility, bitcoin investments could be considered as gambling gains or losses (and therefore gains may not be taxable - or losses deductible). Most significantly for businesses, the UK takes the view that VAT will not be chargeable on bitcoin mining or on most trading transactions. Uncertainty about VAT and bitcoin in Europe has led Sweden to recently request that the EU Court rule on the VAT status of bitcoin. The ATO considered whether bitcoin should be treated as a foreign currency or “money” for tax. Some Australian and English courts have taken a functional approach to defining money as a “generally accepted medium and means of exchange, without being legal tender” [Emmett J, Travelex]. However, this is not widely accepted and other courts indicate that money must be issued or authorised by an act of sovereignty. A fundamental feature of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is that they are non-fiat, that is, not established or backed by a government. But what if bitcoin was to gain recognition as a currency by governments in future? This would undermine the ATO approach. California recently legislated to remove impediments for corporations to put bitcoin into circulation although its not legal tender in the US. The ATO rulings do not discuss jurisdiction to tax bitcoin and nor do they address the challenges of secrecy and tax evasion or money laundering potential of bitcoin. These and other issues are raised in a recent OECD report on tax and the digital economy and an OECD working paper. The question of which country has a right to tax (and ability to enforce tax rules) is increasingly difficult to answer in the digital world. If mining, or trading, bitcoin is a business or service, where does this occur, given that bitcoin operates on a global peer-to-peer network? It’s possible that countries will treat bitcoin differently for tax and other regulatory purposes. The German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority classifies bitcoin as a financial instrument or “unit of account” that functions as a form of private money, for regulatory purposes. The inability to identify bitcoin owners is a serious problem for regulators, who may treat bitcoin as currency or cash for transaction reporting purposes even though tax authorities view it as property - and that could help tax authorities with enforcement. The tax and regulatory challenges of cryptocurrencies are only just beginning.::2014-08-27T20:54:37Z::Australian Taxation Office, Bitcoin, Taxation::Joel Emery::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/57473/original/vgz87m4y-1409113755.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

Bitcoin (BTC) surged past $66,000 for the first time since April 24, and was recently up more than 7% over the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH) changed hands near $3,000 but underperformed with a 4% advance during the same period. Solana (SOL) and near (NEAR) led gains among crypto majors with 8% and 12% jumps, respectively, and the broader market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) was up 6%. The rally occurred as April U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures edged lower from March, coupled with a slightly sluggish retail sales report. The data came as a relief for investors fearing that reaccelerating inflation and a red-hot economy might force the Federal Reserve to walk back its dovish pivot and even consider interest rate hikes. "Investors consider this as a bullish regime shift, as it marks the first decrease in CPI inflation over the last three months," Bitfinex analysts said in a market update. This, together with the Federal Reserve previously announcing its intention to taper the central bank's balance sheet run-off, "is seen as a favorable print for risk assets," Bitfinex added. Looking at traditional markets, U.S. equities also climbed during the day, with the S&P 500 index gaining more than 1% and hitting a fresh all-time high, underscoring the return of risk appetite. Today's bitcoin surge also marked a break-out from a downtrend that capped prices for the last few weeks, Swissblock analysts said in a Telegram update. "BTC [is] finally making the bigger move," Swissblock said. "We have been waiting for the trigger for the release of a larger structure since March high. Today we got that," referring to the CPI and retail sales numbers. The analytics firm said the breakout opens the way for BTC to rally $69,000 first, then later potentially towards new all-time highs targeting the $84,000 price level. During the next leg up, "altcoins will follow strongly," the report added. Edited by Stephen Alpher.

492::https://beincrypto.com/donald-trump-meme-coins-skyrocketing/::BeInCrypto::article::This Investment in Donald Trump-Themed Meme Coins Triggers Price Boom::Donald Trump-themed meme coins surge up to 124% in 24 hours, gaining the spotlight among crypto enthusiasts.::We use cookies to improve your experience.  Donald Trump-themed altcoins have experienced a meteoric rise, capturing the attention of both crypto enthusiasts and political spectators. This surge comes as Mechanism Capital, a prominent crypto fund, announces its strategic investment in Trump-related meme coins, marking its first new positions in 2024. The crypto market has witnessed substantial volatility with several Trump-themed tokens on blockchains like Ethereum and Solana. In fact, they have registered gains of up to 124% in just 24 hours. This unprecedented spike is largely attributed to Mechanism Capital’s bullish stance on such assets. Andrew Kang, co-founder of Mechanism Capital, explained the rationale. He highlighted the potent combination of meme coins and Donald Trump’s ability to dominate the news cycle, especially with ongoing US primary elections. Read more: 7 Hot Meme Coins and Altcoins that are Trending in 2024 Kang stressed that the appeal of Trump-themed meme coins goes beyond election outcomes. It is tied to Trump’s continuous media presence, driven by his provocative statements and numerous legal battles. These factors create an ongoing news cycle, keeping Trump and Trump-themed altcoins in the spotlight. “This bet is not just on whether Trump wins or not. Polling indicates that he’s very likely to win but that’s not the point. The point is that he’s going to be in headlines everywhere all the time and people are constantly going to be talking about Trump. His whole strategy is being provocative, saying outrageous and funny things, things that get the people going,” Kang explained. DexTools data confirms the increasing interest in MAGA’s TRUMP token. It boasts a market capitalization of over $117.27 million. It also recorded trading volumes of $4.84 million in the last 24 hours. Additionally, a crypto wallet, possibly linked to Trump, holds more than $1.45 million in TRUMP tokens. Initially funded with $7,100 from the meme coin’s developers, this wallet’s value has skyrocketed, highlighting the rising speculative interest in Trump’s political actions. Read more: 13 Best Altcoins To Invest In February 2024 Moreover, TRUMP tokens now represent the lion’s share of Donald Trump’s crypto holdings, surpassing even mainstream assets like Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) and Ethereum (ETH). This shift reflects the unique appeal of Trump-themed digital assets and signals a broader trend of political figures influencing market dynamics in the crypto ecosystem. Kang acknowledged the investment strategy’s risks. Meme coins’ volatility and the uncertainty of Trump’s support for the TRUMP token present significant challenges. Nevertheless, Kang maintained optimism, comparing it to the meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, which have endured similar challenges.

493::https://blockworks.co/news/2024-bitcoin-halving-new-era::Blockworks::article::The 2024 halving could usher in a new era for Bitcoin::Opinion: The fourth Bitcoin halving event, expected to fall on April 19, 2024, heralds a significant transformation in the crypto landscape.::The upcoming halving brings forth novel dynamics that could reshape prevailing narratives around Bitcoin economics Artwork by Crystal Le The fourth Bitcoin halving event, expected to fall on or around April 19, 2024, heralds a significant transformation in the cryptocurrency landscape. At its core, the quadrennial halving event entails a reduction in the reward granted to miners for each block mined on the Bitcoin blockchain (the block subsidy) as determined by the protocol. Halvings are scheduled to occur roughly every four years, or every 210,000 blocks until the entire 21 million bitcoin supply is mined, approximately by 2140. As part of bitcoin’s deflationary approach to its capped supply, the upcoming halving will reduce the bitcoin supply subsidy from 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC, fostering a more stringent supply landscape. Read more: The history of Bitcoin halvings — and why this time might look different By gradually decreasing the number of bitcoin entering circulation, and, so long as the adoption of Bitcoin grows over time, the halving mechanism ensures the laws of supply and demand will consistently impact the value of the asset. Historically, each halving event has been accompanied by a significant surge in bitcoin price in the months preceding and following the event. The pre-halving rally has shown a diminishing trend over time, likely due to miners selling off their bitcoin holdings to secure profits ahead of the impending reward reduction. Read more: Bitcoin miner consolidation appears imminent as halving looms Nevertheless, the historical pattern suggests the potential for bitcoin to reach new all-time highs in the aftermath of the 2024 halving. The landscape surrounding bitcoin has evolved significantly, particularly with the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs and the influx of institutional capital into the market. These ETFs have generated substantial daily demand, surpassing the pace of new bitcoin supply even before the halving and have the potential to absorb a considerable portion of the limited new issuance. To put the spot bitcoin ETF inflows into perspective, at the current rate of block rewards, the bitcoin network produces about 900 new coins per day, or around $54 million worth of bitcoin (assuming an average price per coin of $60,000). In April 2024, issuance will fall to 450 coins, or about $27 million worth of bitcoin. During the month of February, net inflows into the US-listed spot bitcoin ETFs averaged $208 million per day, far outstripping the pace of new supply, even before the halving. Read more: Bitcoin ETF snapshot: Segment’s week net inflows hit record $2.5B This imbalance between new demand and limited new issuance has likely contributed to the strong upward pressure on the price. The emergence of a robust, regulated derivatives market marks a fundamental shift in the narrative surrounding the halving for three key reasons: It enables price risks to be hedged, it facilitates the management of bitcoin demand risk, and it provides market participants with actionable price discovery. Miners typically sold their bitcoin for fiat currency as they mined them, to pay for operational costs. This constant selling meant that price appreciation was measured. After a halving event, miners would have fewer bitcoin to sell, meaning the price could go up. Mining is now dominated by larger, often publicly traded, companies and with a liquid regulated derivatives market, it is possible for these firms to hedge and lock in future bitcoin prices to cover expenses without selling their coins. If this is the case, then selling pressure from miners is less likely to act as a drag on bitcoin prices going forward. A higher number of investors and traders means better liquidity and enhanced price stability for bitcoin. It’s worth noting that bitcoin has become less volatile in recent years, with fewer extreme moves both to the upside and to the downside The impending halving poses challenges and opportunities for miners, as evidenced by shifts in miner behavior and industry dynamics. Decreased bitcoin reserves held by miners, coupled with heightened competition and record high hash rates, underscore the need for operational efficiency and strategic adaptation. The number of bitcoin held in wallets associated with miners has dropped to the lowest level since July 2021, suggesting miners are perhaps capitalizing on bitcoin’s recent price surge, running down their inventory ahead of the halving or leveraging them to raise capital for upgrading machinery and mining facilities. In previous cycles, there weren’t many large-scale miners and even fewer publicly traded ones. The halving may catalyze merger and acquisition activities among mining firms, driving industry consolidation and fostering innovation in sustainable mining practices. The recent surge in retail demand can be attributed in part to the rise of bitcoin Ordinals BRC-20 tokens, which are reshaping the crypto landscape. These tokens, often likened to “NFTs for Bitcoin,” have the potential to drive on-chain activity and increase transaction fees, thereby bolstering miners’ revenue streams amid declining block rewards post-halving. Bitcoin’s designation as “digital gold” underscores its role as a store of value, particularly amid the scarcity reinforced by halving events. Institutional investors who view bitcoin as a hedge against inflation may find the halving supportive of its perceived value. Shifts in central bank policies, such as prolonged higher interest rates and potential quantitative easing measures, could further bolster bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge against currency devaluation. Read more from our opinion section: Stop worrying so much about the next Bitcoin halving Looking ahead, the implication of bitcoin’s programmed scarcity intersecting with evolving demand dynamics remains intriguing. While past having cycles, with the associated price rallies offer valuable insights, the 2024 halving presents a unique confluence of factors that could usher in a new era for bitcoin. With 28 more halving events expected over the next 112 years, the future trajectory of bitcoin adoption and network growth warrants close monitoring — especially when broader access to bitcoin was only made possible in the US less than 90 days ago with the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs. As institutional and retail interest converges with regulatory developments and macroeconomic shifts, maintaining a balanced perspective is imperative to navigating the evolving Bitcoin landscape.

The ongoing management of this open-source project is currently handled by the Solana Foundation, which is based in Geneva. Solana (SOL) was designed with the intention to function similarly to Ethereum. The platform was created by Anatoly Yakovenko, a software developer, and takes its name from a charming coastal city in Southern California. Related: What is Tether (1 USDT)? How does it work? The Solana network offers a wide range of capabilities commonly found in other cryptocurrency networks, such as smart contracts, transaction settlement, and token issuance. However, Solana aims to distinguish itself from its competitors by delivering faster settlement times and greater transaction capacity. Solana has been used for the development of NFT (Non-Fungible Token) applications, enabling users to create and trade digital artwork. Users have the ability to establish their own NFT and us various tools to generate NFT. Furthermore they can integrate NFTs into other applications, such as games, expanding the possibilities for their utilization. In addition, Solana provides support for games that implement Play-2-Earn systems, enabling players to earn cryptocurrencies and NFTs as they engage in gameplay. Several popular games that are backed by Solana include Aurory, Chainers, and the Naga Kingdom. These games offer an innovative approach where players can be rewarded with valuable digital assets while enjoying their gaming experience. Amazing developments are taking place on the Solana blockchain, enabling programmers to create apps that, can leverage the latest internet technology. Some of the well-known applications include: Dispatch, Alchemy and Audius. Please note that the following statement is our opinion and should not be considered financial advice. In our oppinion the Solana blockchain offers users the advantage of affordable transaction fees while maintaining a high level of stability and effectiveness. This combination of factors makes solana an appealing choice for long-term cryptocurrency investments. Investing in SOL at its current trading levels may be a favorable decision considering it is trading near its lows. However, it is important to acknowledge the high volatility associated with any cryptocurrency. It is crucial to never risk more than what you are willing to lose. To optimize your return on investment, particularly in the cryptocurrency market, it is advisable to consider a long-term investment strategy.

496::https://theconversation.com/with-bitcoin-hitting-new-highs-itll-likely-reach-the-us-100-000-milestone-before-2024-is-out-225591::The Conversation::article::With bitcoin hitting new highs, it’ll likely reach the US$100,000 milestone before 2024 is out::Often dismissed as a libertarian ponzi scheme, why has crypto bounced back yet again?::Cryptocurrencies are surging again. Bitcoin has just hit an all-time high of more than US$72,000 (£56,300), pushing past the level of circa US$69,000 where it turned back during its last bull phase in late 2021. Other top cryptocurrencies like ethereum and solana have reached their highest prices in three years, on the back of a run that has been going since the autumn. The value of the whole cryptocurrency market has raced up to US$2.6 trillion, triple what it was worth at the beginning of 2023 and not far off its previous US$3 trillion peak. Much of this run has occurred at a time when the US dollar has been strengthening against other currencies (though it has fallen in the past couple of weeks). This can often be a time when cryptocurrencies get weaker, so it shows how strong they have been lately. Many other fiat currencies around the world have been losing value against the US dollar during this period, so bitcoin reached all-time highs in many of them long before it finally took out its high in the US currency. So what has contributed to this explosion in prices and where is the market going for the rest of 2024? A major driver for this appreciation in prices has been the US authorities’ approval in January of an investment vehicle known as an exchange-traded fund or ETF for the general or “spot” bitcoin market. An ETF is an easy way for the average saver to get exposure to an asset, since they buy shares in the vehicle, usually through their financial advisor, rather than having to go to the trouble of buying the underlying asset. A total of 11 bitcoin ETFs were approved in the US, and their daily trading volume has now exceeded US$10 billion – driven by frontrunners Blackrock and Fidelity Investments. This demonstrates the large interest from traditional market participants, and as the spot ETFs become more mature, their providers will offer more promotional material and education to get more customers onboard. Bitcoin/US$ price The cryptocurrency market is always adapting and innovating, and one possible future innovation is the offer of option contracts on the new spot ETFs. Options allow traders to hedge their bets on whether the crypto market will go up or down, and would likely attract even more new money into the space. However, US regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has just postponed a decision on this innovation until late April. Some experts think approval may take longer than that as it is unclear which regulatory body would be responsible for policing this new class of derivative contracts. One feature of the bitcoin system which was built in at the beginning is that, roughly every four years, the rewards to companies using arrays of computers to create or “mine” bitcoin get cut in half. The last halving took place in May 2020, where miners went from receiving 12.5 bitcoin for each unit of work they do to 6.25 bitcoin. The next is due to take place on April 19, cutting the reward down to 3.125 bitcoin. Because each halving means less new bitcoin coming on to the market, they have coincided with strong price appreciation in the cryptocurrency. What isn’t clear is whether this is already priced in and therefore not actually the reason price is going up. One theory is that the institutions behind the spot ETFs are buying aggressively now because they know there will be less bitcoin on the open market once the halving takes place. Meanwhile, the crypto market could also be boosted by spot ETFs for the ethereum cryptocurrency system in the coming months. At least ten firms, including Blackrock and Fidelity, have applied to launch them and the SEC has until May to make a decision. Whereas the online ledger that underpins bitcoin, known as its blockchain, has been seen largely as a store of value, ethereum has become the leading blockchain for developers to write applications using this technology. SEC Chair Gary Gensler believes that most cryptocurrencies should be treated differently to bitcoin, as financial instruments known as securities rather than as more straightforward commodities. This adds complexity to the ethereum ETF approval process. If the US authorities were to decide it was the case, it would mean that ETFs couldn’t buy ethereum from crypto exchanges until those exchanges had received approval to trade it as a security. While that uncertainty continues, ethereum could be boosted by the so-called Dencun upgrade (also known as Duncan or EIP-4844). Ethereum has competition from other blockchains such as solana and avalanche due to its relatively slow transaction speed and high costs. It already completed its first major step in a long-term plan to reduce costs and cope with many more users (known as scalability) when it transitioned in 2023 to a different system for verifying transactions known as proof of stake. The Dencun upgrade, which goes live on March 13, will further improve scalability by making data storage more efficient on the network, while also lowering transaction fees. Predicting cryptocurrency prices is not for the faint-hearted. The market is very volatile, and often exceeds expectations when it goes up or down. The behaviour of individuals determines market prices and, as Isaac Newton put it, you can “calculate the motions of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of the people”. However, the majority of commentators expect crypto prices to keep rising over the coming months. Election years tend to be good for investments in general, while a second Trump administration would probably create a more favourable regulatory environment for crypto assets (as would a Rishi Sunak victory in the UK, however unlikely that seems at present). As bitcoin becomes more and more mainstream and integrated with traditional assets, it isn’t inconceivable that it could hit US$100,000 in 2024 – an extraordinary feat for a invention that was worth nothing as recently as 2009.::2024-03-12T14:39:27Z::Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, Ethereum::Andrew Urquhart::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/581312/original/file-20240312-22-2jc5dz.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=118%2C468%2C4695%2C2347&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

According to data sources TradingView and CoinDesk, the leading cryptocurrency by market value rose over 7.5% to $66,250, the largest percentage rise since March 20. Like other risk assets, BTC is sensitive to expected changes in the monetary policy stance of major central banks and rallies when the cost of borrowing fiat money is forecast to decline. Data released by the U.S. Labor Department Wednesday showed the consumer price index (CPI) increased less than consensus estimates in April, signaling a renewed downward shift in the cost of living in the world’s largest economy. The headline CPI rose 0.3% last month after advancing 0.4% in March and February. The core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 0.3% in April after advancing 0.4% in March. Other data showed that headline retail sales growth stalled in April, with the sales in the “control group” category, which feeds into the GDP calculation, declining 0.3% month-on-month. As such, rate-cut expectations shifted significantly. Fed funds futures show traders expect the Fed to deliver the first 25 basis point rate cut in September. (This year’s summer is set to start on June 20 and end on September 22). The Fed recently signaled that it will reduce the pace of quantitative tightening, also a liquidity tightening tool, from June. It’s not just the Fed. Markets expect the Bank of England (BOE) and the European Central Bank (ECB) to cut rates in June. The Swiss National Bank (SNB) and Sweden’s Riksbank have already reduced their benchmark borrowing costs. Central banks worldwide are pivoting toward renewed monetary or liquidity easing, which is a positive sign for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, as evident from the chart below from the data tracking website MacroMicro. The percentage of global central banks whose last move was a rate hike is falling fast, while the percentage of banks with rate cuts as the last move is rising. In other words, the net percentage of central bank cutting rates is rising. “The higher the proportion goes, the more central banks are cutting rates, which could help improve market liquidity. The lower the proportion, the less liquidity there is in the market,” MacroMicro said in the explainer. Prospects for liquidity easing over Summer should support equities, giving investors adequate confidence "to remain further out on the risk curve," according to broking firm Pepperstone.

Leading crypto exchanges, including Binance, have announced the listing of the airdrop token – Dymension (DYM) on February 6. This development introduces new trading opportunities for Binance users with the inclusion of DYM/BTC, DYM/USDT, DYM/FDUSD, and DYM/TRY spot trading pairs. Starting at 17:00 UTC Tuesday, users can deposit DYM for upcoming trading activities. Withdrawal options will be available starting at 15:00 UTC Wednesday. Dymension, a newcomer in crypto, gained attention for its innovative approach, using the Inter-Blockchain Communication standard to secure and interconnect rollups. This modular blockchain raised $6.7 million in a private token round. It garnered support from notable backers like Big Brain Holdings, Stratos Technologies, and MatchboxDAO, showing institutional confidence in its potential. However, with great potential comes heightened risk and volatility. Hence, Binance has applied the Seed Tag to DYM, demanding thorough research and risk management from investors. “The Seed Tag represents innovative project that may exhibit higher volatility and risks compared to other listed tokens. The Seed Tag will be applied to DYM,” Binance stated. Other prominent exchanges like KuCoin, ByBit, MEXC, Bitget, and Gate.io will also list DYM, further broadening its market presence. While the DYM IOU is currently trading at $4, indicative of high-interest levels, it is crucial to note that this price may not reflect the token’s value upon official trading commencement.

Bitcoin and ether lost 5% and 7%, respectively, over 24 hours, according to data from Coinbase. Bitcoin (BTC) is now trading around $65,200 after managing to stay in the low $70,000 range over the weekend. Ether (ETH) hovered at $3,200 Tuesday afternoon, per Coinbase, continuing a selloff that started Monday. “The onset of [the second quarter] has been marked by pronounced deleveraging, evidenced by the decline in perpetual funding rates from ~80% to ~11% over the last three sessions,” research analysts at Wintermute wrote in a Tuesday note. “This reflects a broad correction, with traders closing out highly leveraged positions and reassessing flow.” Read more: Why is 2140 the end of bitcoin inflation? The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes opened lower but recovered slightly later in the session, with each trading around 1% lower at time of publication. At its session low Tuesday, the benchmark Dow lost more than 500 points. Analysts say changing expectations around the pace of interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve has traders uneasy. Fed fund futures show a 40% chance central bankers will hold rates at their current level through June, according to CME Group. The decline in crypto prices comes as bitcoin’s next halving event inches closer. The date of the largest cryptocurrency’s fourth halving is expected to be around April 19, 2024. “While the short-term price impact of the halving has been mixed in the past, BTC tends to increase in the nine to 12 months post-halving,” analysts from research firm Kaiko wrote in a note Tuesday. Read more: The history of Bitcoin halvings — and why this time might look different Bitcoin is today closer to its most recent all-time high — $73,780.07, set in mid-March — than it has been for past halving events, but the landscape around the asset class also looks different. “The approval of the spot ETFs contributed to a significant change in BTC’s supply-demand dynamics, which could impact price during and after the halving,” Kaiko analysts said.

Tether Limited developed the digital currency USDT to serve as the internet’s Digital Dollar, with each token worth $1 USD and being backed by $1 USD in real money. A low volatility digital asset that often keeps a steady valuation is offered by stablecoins like Tether. A stablecoin seeks to keep the same value as its peg by having its value tied to a stable asset, such as gold, the US dollar, or another fiat currency. Investors who want to protect their digital currency assets from inherent volatility utilize it to do so while maintaining value inside the cryptocurrency market that is readily available for use. The precursor to Tether, originally named “Realcoin”, was announced in July 2014 by co-founders Brock Pierce, Reeve Collins, and Craig Sellars as a Santa Monica based startup. The first tokens were issued on 6 October 2014, on the Bitcoin blockchain. This was done by using the Omni Layer Protocol. On 20 November 2014, Tether CEO Reeve Collins announced the project was being renamed to “Tether”. The company also announced it was entering private beta, which supported a “Tether+ token” for three currencies: USTether (US+) for United States dollars, EuroTether (EU+) for euros and YenTether (JP+) for Japanese yen. Tether said “Every Tether+ token is backed 100% by its original currency, and can be redeemed at any time with no exposure to exchange risk. Through cryptocurrency exchanges, you can purchase Tether with fiat money like euros or dollars. Get acquainted with the USDT price history and the current exchange rate first. Your Tether investment can be viewed and used in a digital wallet that looks like a banking app once it has been purchased. After that, you can decide whether to keep your USDT or sell it again on the exchange. You can buy Tether, on a number of well-known exchanges. Tether (USDT) can be used to buy a variety of commodities from different vendors or to convert into other currencies. Tether has already established partnerships with a number of businesses and services, making it possible to pay with cryptocurrency for things like hotel stays and flights, as well as a few other establishments that recognize Tether as legal tender. Some people will buy USDT in order to buy NFTs, and take part in ICOs. The corporation did not provide much detail about its reserves until 2022. Previously, the only statement on Tether’s website was “All Tether tokens are pegged at 1-to-1 with a matching fiat currency and are backed 100% by Tether’s reserves.” Stablecoins require significant financial reserves. They back each unit with tangible assets, fostering stability and trust. A steady reserve serves to guarantee trust and a constant value. The stablecoin may depeg, or lose its 1:1 value with the original fiat currency, when reserves are threatened. Another stablecoin, USDC, fell as low as $0.88 in March, at the height of the spring banking crisis.

501::https://cryptobriefing.com/opensea-considers-acquisition-nft-market-consolidation-continues/::Crypto Briefing::article::OpenSea considers acquisition as NFT market consolidation continues::Finzer stated in a recent interview that OpenSea has received offers and interest regarding an acquisition.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea remains “open” to the prospect of an acquisition as the broader NFT industry sees increased consolidation, according to CEO Devin Finzer. “We think that if the right partnership comes along, then that’s something we should certainly consider,” Finzer shares. Finzer stated in a recent interview that OpenSea has received offers and interest regarding an acquisition. Once a dominant player in the NFT sector, OpenSea has been overtaken by Blur, a rival marketplace. Despite having fewer overall users, Blur sees over five times more volume. OpenSea previously had a 90% dominance in the NFT sector. According to data from Dune Analytics, its monthly trading volume has plunged by 96% and is down to just $171 million, with an annualized revenue of $38.9 million. Finzer claims that Blur’s growth tactics involved cutting corners, particularly in terms of legal and regulatory compliance. Blur’s rapid growth is often attributed to its aggressive token airdrops and the marketing campaigns that push these. Market observers see parallels in crypto’s latest bull market resurgence, creating prime conditions for industry consolidation. Dealmakers seek bargains and synergies as prices recover from the crypto crash from the past two years. OpenSea itself stayed active via acquisitions in 2022, purchasing NFT data provider Gem, crypto wallet Dharma Labs, and NFT launch platform Mintdrop. Finzer cites gaining top talent as a key driver for such deals. OpenSea counts high-profile venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz, Paradigm, and Coatue Management among its top investors. They participated in massive fundraising rounds in 2021, when OpenSea achieved a peak $13 billion valuation amid the NFT hype cycle. However, as the NFT market crashed, valuations also crashed. Coatue reportedly slashed the value of its OpenSea stake by 90% late last year. Andreessen Horowitz helped OpenSea raise $423 million in funding for three series in 2021. The prolific firm, led by Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, has backed over 20 crypto startups at a valuation above $1 billion. In November 2023, OpenSea laid off approximately 20 employees, or 50% of its staff, amid plunging NFT sales. “The restructuring that we did was really oriented around adjusting the team composition to be a much leaner, smaller team that can operate more nimbly in the market, as opposed to downsizing due to financial pressure,” Finzer said. Whether driven by financial duress or not, downsizing suggests the firm reset its operations to contend with new competitive and market realities. With OpenSea struggling to maintain market share versus rivals like Blur, its high-profile backers have seen the value of their stakes plummet. Significant dilution should OpenSea raise further rounds, which also presents downside risk.

502::https://theconversation.com/bitcoin-has-shot-up-50-since-the-new-year-but-heres-why-new-lows-are-probably-still-ahead-198682::The Conversation::article::Bitcoin has shot up 50% since the new year, but here’s why new lows are probably still ahead::There’s much excitement among bitcoiners right now – but are they about to be disappointed?::To the delight of investors across the cryptosphere, the price of bitcoin (BTC) has rallied over 53% since its low of US$15,476 (£12,519) in November. Now trading around US$23,000, there’s much talk that the bottom has finally been reached for the leading cryptocurrency after a year of painful decline – in November 2021, the price peaked at almost US$70,000. If so, it’s not only good news for bitcoin but the whole market in cryptocurrencies, since the others broadly move in line with the leader. So is crypto back in business? The past is littered with various periods of market turmoil, from the global financial crisis of 2007-09 to the COVID-19 collapse in 2020. But neither of these is a particularly good comparison for our purposes because they both saw sharp drops and recoveries, as opposed to the slow unwinding of bitcoin. A better comparison would be the dotcom bubble burst in 2000-02, which you can see in the chart below (the Nasdaq is the index that tracks all tech stocks). Nasdaq 100 index 1995-2005 Look at the bitcoin chart since it peaked in November 2021 and the price action looks fairly similar: Bitcoin bear market price chart 2021-23 Both charts show that bear markets go through various periods where prices rise but don’t reach the same level as the previous peak – known as “lower highs”. If bitcoin is following a similar trajectory to the early 2000s Nasdaq, it would make sense that the current price will be another lower high and that it will be followed by another lower low. This is partly because like the 2000s Nasdaq, bitcoin seems to be following a pattern known as an Elliott Wave. Named after the renowned American stock market analyst Ralph Nelson Elliott, this essentially argues that during a bear phase, investors shift between different emotional states of disappointment and hope, before they finally despair and decide the market will never turn in their favour. This is a final wave of heavy selling known as capitulation. You can see this idea on the chart below, where bitcoin is the green and red line and Z is the potential capitulation point at around US$13,000 (click on the chart to make it bigger). The black line is the path that the Nasdaq took in the early 2000s. The blue pointing finger above that line is potentially the equivalent place to where the bitcoin price is now. Bitcoin now vs Nasdaq in the early 2000s The one other thing to note on the chart is the wavy line that’s moving horizontally along the bottom. This is the stochRSI or stochastic relative strength index, which is an indication of when the asset looks overbought (when the line is peaking) or oversold (when it’s bottoming). A sign of a coming shift is when the stochRSI moves in the opposite direction to where the price is heading: so now the stochRSI is coming down but the price has held up around US$23,000. This too suggests a fall could be imminent. Within markets, there is often a game that investors from institutions such as banks and hedge funds play with amateur (retail) investors. The aim is to transfer retail investors’ wealth to these institutions. This is particularly easy in an unregulated market like bitcoin, because it is easier for institutions to manipulate prices. They can also talk up (or talk down) prices to stir up retail investors’ emotions, and get them to buy at the top and sell at the bottom. This “traps” the irrational investors who buy at higher prices, transferring wealth by giving the institutions an opportunity to convert their holdings into cash. It therefore makes sense to compare how the retail and institutional investors have been behaving lately. The following charts compare those crypto wallet addresses that hold 1 BTC or more (mostly retail investors) with those holding upwards of 1,000 BTC (institutional investors). In all three charts, the black line is the bitcoin price and the orange line is the number of wallets in that category. Retail investor behaviour Institutional investor behaviour pt 1 Institutional investor behaviour pt 2 This shows that since the FTX scandal back in November, which led to the world’s second-largest crypto exchange collapse, retail investors have been buying bitcoin aggressively, resulting in the highest number of addresses holding at least one BTC ever. On the other hand, the biggest institutional investors have been offloading. This suggests that the institutional investors agree with our analysis. There are those who argue that bitcoin is a bubble and that ultimately cryptocurrencies are worthless. That’s a separate debate for another day. If we assume there is a future for blockchains, which are the online ledgers that enable cryptocurrencies, the key question is when bitcoin will reach the accumulation phase that typically ends a bear phase in any market. Known as Wyckoff accumulation, this is where the price of the asset repeatedly tests two areas: the upper bound where traders previously sold heavily enough for the price to stop rising (known as resistance), and the lower bound where traders bought heavily enough that the price stopped going down (known as support). At the point where institutional investors decide the lower bound has proved to be sufficiently resilient – in other words, they think the price is cheap at that level – they will start buying the asset again. That moment is only likely to come after there has been a capitulation. Of course, history does not repeat itself exactly. It may be this is the first time that retail investors have outsmarted the large institutions, and that the only way is now up. More likely, however, there is more pain on the way. With a recession on the cards, unprecedented job layoffs and weak retail data coming out of the US, it doesn’t point to the kind of optimism that tends to move markets higher. It would therefore make sense to brace yourself for another plunge in the price of bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market.::2023-01-27T17:04:19Z::Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, NASDAQ, bear market, dotcom bubble::James Kinsella::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/506823/original/file-20230127-16-4cgk1e.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=58%2C268%2C1769%2C883&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

CME is already the top bitcoin futures exchange by open interest, while offshore, non-regulated Binance dominates the spot market. The exchange has held discussions with traders who want to trade bitcoin on a regulated marketplace, the FT reported, citing people with direct knowledge of the talks. CME's spot trading business could be run through the EBS currency trading venue in Switzerland, the report added. The exchange did not want to comment on the report. The spot market will complement the CME’s existing standard and micro futures contracts, which are widely considered a proxy for institutional activity, and help the exchange become more dominant in the crypto market. The CME is already the top bitcoin futures exchange by open interest, while the offshore, non-regulated Binance dominates the spot market. Coinbase (COIN), the only U.S. traded crypto exchange, is No. 3 by daily trading volume. The availability of the spot market means traders can now set up complex multi-leg strategies involving spot and futures markets in one regulated place. Carry traders are known to short CME futures against long spot market positions on other exchanges or in spot ETFs. “Crypto exchanges might lose some business with the potential debut of a bitcoin spot market on the CME, a global derivatives giant, as the present bull run is particularly driven by institutions, who prefer to trade on regulated avenues," Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said.

Learn what's driving its dramatic price increase.::We use cookies to improve your experience.  The altcoin Space ID (ID) witnessed an astonishing 80% surge in value within a few hours, captivating traders and analysts alike. The community is watching Space ID developments closely with questions about the sustainability of this altcoin’s surge. The remarkable uptick in price coincides with South Korea’s largest crypto exchange, Upbit, announcing the introduction of the ID’s Korean won trading pair. ID’s value spike also highlighted DWF Labs’ role in the market. According to SpotOnChain, the firm conducted major transactions with ID tokens. This includes withdrawing 3.62 million ID, worth around $1.73 million, from OKX. Then, it quickly deposited 2.45 million ID, around $1.12 million, to Binance via Amber Group. These network activities were traced back to an address labeled DWF Labs.

This makes Upbit the fifth-largest ID holder. Still, Upbit’s ID accumulation sparks market speculation due to DWF Labs and Upbit’s past impact on token volatility. “In the past, DWF Labs and Upbit were related to the aggressive pumps and dumps of several tokens,” SpotOnChain said.

CryptoNoan, a pseudonymous crypto trader, expressed intentions to short the ID altcoin, citing its overvaluation after the Upbit listing announcement. “ID suddenly became the rarest coin, trading with -3% funding on MEXC. I will short this around 0.48/0.49 after the next funding reset,” CryptoNoan remarked.

505::https://blockworks.co/news/hut-8-diversification-around-bitcoin-halving::Blockworks::article::Bitcoin miner Hut 8 doubles down on diversification, discipline around halving::Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot said the company is looking at ways to boost its presence in the high-performance computing and AI realms.::CEO Asher Genoot said Hut 8 is looking at ways to boost its presence in the high-performance computing and AI realms Artwork by Crystal Le Hut 8 looks to deploy its large stack of bitcoin holdings with “discipline” heading into the bitcoin halving while further diversifying its revenue streams, the company’s chief executive said. The company, which completed a merger of equals with US Bitcoin Corp last year, tallied $60.6 million in revenue during the second half of 2023. Net income was $6.2 million over that span. Nearly 70% of that revenue comes from crypto mining, CEO Asher Genoot said during the company’s earnings call Thursday. But Hut 8 seeks to further diversify its revenue streams across its managed services business, the CEO noted — as well as boost its standing in the high-performance computing (HPC) and AI realms. Read more: Hut 8 switches CEOs as it eyes ‘new strategic direction’ after merger The company jumped into the HPC space by buying wireless connectivity company TerraGo in January 2022. It signed an agreement last year to offer colocation HPC services to Canadian health authority Interior Health. It is not the only one looking into the segment. Hive Digital Technologies rebranded last July as part of a pivot to HPC. Core Scientific said earlier this month it would lease up to 16 megawatts of capacity in its Austin data center to cloud provider CoreWeave. Hut 8’s HPC business is “sub-scale today,” Genoot acknowledged. He added that the HPC business will need more investment to be equipped to handle AI machines. “But we are excited about that business because we see it as a foundation to be able to grow, especially when you look at GPUs, AI and data centers and look at the different parts of the value chain in that ecosystem,” he said on the call. Hut 8 held 9,110 bitcoin (BTC), as of Feb. 29 — valued at roughly $650 million Thursday morning. The miner is set to use its bitcoin reserves to take advantage of growth opportunities around the Bitcoin halving — expected on or around April 20. At that point per-block mining rewards are set to drop from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, putting financial pressure on the segment’s participants. Read more: The Bitcoin halving is just weeks away — here’s how miners have prepared Hut 8 is considering various M&A opportunities like buying sites and properties, as well as machine purchases. But Genoot previously told Blockworks that Hut 8 would not seek out growth at all costs — adding that it would look to not overpay for sites, for example, when possible to develop its infrastructure for less. Executives noted during the Thursday call that it would be closely monitoring the prices of mining machines, adding the company may choose to wait until after the halving, or when newer-generation machines are available. Similarly, Core Scientific CEO Adam Sullivan recently told Blockworks his company would look to buy machines — at lower prices — from struggling miners unable to afford parts of their existing orders. It is also set to continue nixing inefficiencies, like retiring old machines — as it did upon shuttering operations at its Drumheller facility in Alberta, Canada earlier this month. Read more: Miners continue money-conscious moves ahead of the Bitcoin halving “You’ll see us continuing to be creative in how we maximize the value of every machine, whether that is done at the end of life, finding a better home for them in terms of generating the most amount of profit or under-clocking a certain percentage of them to increase efficiency,” Genoot said. Hut 8’s stock price was up about 21% on the day, as of 12 pm ET Thursday. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. Subscribe to the Empire newsletter.

Get the inside scoop and become a crypto master. Don't miss out, start today!::A meme coin (aka memecoin) is a word used in the cryptocurrency world to refer to well-liked currencies that have ardent online supporters and traders and are occasionally portrayed with humorous or animated memes. Meme coins may be entertaining, but they are also extremely risky investments that may or may not have any real value. This group includes currencies like Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, and other altcoins that may be more entertaining than practical. Understanding the dangers is essential while purchasing or trading meme coins so that you can steer clear of unforeseen volatility and losses. Meme coins are a type of cryptocurrency that has an enthusiastic online community that supports its development. They can occasionally be recognized by memes of animated animals or characters. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu were among the top cryptocurrencies to achieve meme coin status during the most recent cryptocurrency boom. Little-known currencies like Baby Doge and Dogelon Mars are included in this list. Baby Doge and Dogelon Mars still have market capitalizations in the nine figures despite receiving less media attention. Memecoins rely on blockchain technology, like other cryptocurrencies, which is a sort of distributed database used to track virtual assets, such as cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Unlike Ethereum and other utility currencies linked to specific blockchain characteristics, the majority of meme coins are just used as trading platforms. Meme coins generally do not include popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dollar Coin, XRP, Cardano, Solana, Polygon, and Polkadot. More than 300 currencies are included in the Meme Coin section of the cryptocurrency website CoinMarketCap. Many, however, are not traded frequently and are hence worthless. Only Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Dogelon Mars, and Baby Dogecoin have a daily trade volume of more than $1 million in the meme currency category. All of them are typically regarded as volatile and dangerous trading assets. While ether is necessary for Ethereum blockchain transactions, the majority of meme coins are just useful for trade and collecting. Some meme coins are actually tokens that operate on a different blockchain rather than actual currency. Shiba Inu, for instance, is an ERC-20 token that runs on the Ethereum network. Meme coins have been referred to as complex pump-and-dump operations by some in the media and investment community. Investors should be extremely cautious when entering these markets as a result of this claim and should be aware of meme currencies. Anyone with the necessary technical knowledge is easily able to create a cryptocurrency. However, turning a coin or token into a popular meme coin is extremely difficult and has only been successfully achieved a few dozen times. There is no exact answer to this question. Meme coin can be both a very good investment and a regular scam. Don’t spend more money on this than you’re willing to spend. Better invest that money in something else.

507::https://cryptobriefing.com/solanas-nft-trading-volume-25-weekly-rise/::Crypto Briefing::article::Solana’s NFT trading volume sees a 25% weekly rise::The $62 million in weekly trades was driven by high-value collections like Tensorians, CryptoUndeads, and Froganas.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Solana’s non-fungible tokens (NFTs) weekly trading volume surpassed $62 million, showing a 25% rise according to on-chain data aggregator CryptoSlam. After a slow January start, Solana (SOL) NFT activity seems to be picking up, with almost $190 million in trading volume this month. In December 2023, Solana’s NFT sales volume went over $365 million and overtook Ethereum’s, only standing behind Bitcoin’s market share. Even with the relatively small volume when compared to last month’s, January’s total amount of sales is the highest Solana has had since May 2022. Despite the rise in sales volume, the number of NFT-related transactions made on Solana’s blockchain fell by 15%. This indicates larger average transactions, which can be related to the NFT collection Tensorians. Their trading volume rose 107% over the past seven days, reaching $4.6 million, and each Tensorian has an 88 SOL floor price. CryptoUndeads and Froganas were also among last week’s most popular Solana NFT collections, showing $15 million and $4.6 million, respectively. Moreover, another interesting development in Solana’s NFT market seen in the past seven days is the fall in transactions labeled by CryptoSlam as wash trading. Although the amount is still relevant, a total of $3.6 million, this is almost 50% less than what was registered from January 11 to 17. In comparison, the amount of NFT sales on Ethereum labeled last week as wash trading is $90.5 million.

508::https://theconversation.com/can-blockchain-a-swiftly-evolving-technology-be-controlled-73471::The Conversation::article::Can blockchain, a swiftly evolving technology, be controlled?::Laws cannot keep pace with technological advances – but that may not be a bad thing.::The headlong pace of technological change produces giant leaps forward in knowledge, innovation, new possibilities and, almost inevitably, legal problems. That’s now the case with blockchain, today’s buzziest new tech tool. Introduced in 2008 as the technology underpinning Bitcoin, a digital currency that is created and held electronically without any central authority, blockchain is a secure digital ledger for any kind of data. It simplifies record keeping and reduces transaction costs. Its range of applications in commerce, finance and potentially politics continues to widen, and that has triggered a debate around how to regulate the tool. Because it does not require a centralised authority to verify and validate transactions, blockchain enables people who may not trust each other to interact and coordinate directly. With blockchain, there is no middleman in peer-to-peer exchanges; instead, users rely on a decentralised network of computers that interact through a cryptographic, secure protocol. Blockchain has the ability to “codify” transactions by deploying small snippets of code directly onto the blockchain. This code, generally referred to as a “smart contract”, executes automatically when certain conditions are met. An early example of smart contracts are the corporate-oriented digital rights management (DRM) systems limiting uses of digital files. Having DRM on your ebook may restrict access to copying, editing, and printing content. With blockchain, smart contracts have become more complex and, arguably, more secure. In theory, they will always be executed exactly as planned, since no one party has the power to alter the code binding a given transaction. In practice, however, eliminating trusted brokers from a transaction can create some kinks. One high-profile smart-contract failure happened to the DAO, a decentralised autonomous organisation for venture capital funding. Launched in April 2016, the DAO quickly raised over US$150 million via crowdfunding. Three weeks later, someone managed to exploit a vulnerability in the DAO’s code, draining approximately US$50 million worth of digital currency from the fund. The security problem originated not in the blockchain itself but rather from issues with the smart-contract code used to administer the DAO. Questions arose about the legality of the act, with some people arguing that since the hack was actually permitted by the smart-contract code, it was a perfectly legitimate action. After all, in cyberspace, “code is law”. The DAO debate raised this key question: should the intention of the code prevail over the wording of the code? Blockchain proponents envision a future in which entire companies and governments operate in a distributed and automated fashion. But smart contracts pose a series of enforceability issues, which are outlined in a recent white paper by the London law firm Norton Rose Fulbright. How can we resolve disputes arising over a self-executing smart contract? How do we identify what types of contractual terms can be properly translated into code, and which ones should instead be left to natural language? And is there a way combine the two? It is not yet clear that code can address the necessary levels of complexity to replace legal language. After all, the vagueness inherent in the language of law is a feature, not a bug: it compensates for unforeseeable cases that must be assessed on a case-by-case basis in a court of law. Traditional contracts acknowledge that no law can index the entire complexity of life as it is, let alone predict its future development. They also precisely define terms that can be enforced by law. Smart contracts, by contrast, are simply snippets of code both defined and enforced by the code underpinning the blockchain infrastructure. Currently, they do not have any legal recognition. This means that when something goes wrong in a smart contract, parties have no legal recourse. The DAO’s founders painfully learned this lesson last year. If blockchain technologies are ever to go mainstream, governments will have to set up new legal frameworks to accommodate such complexities. Positive law prescribes behaviour and penalises non-compliance. It can encapsulate the normative ideal that a respective government seeks to achieve, demonstrate an ethical vision for society or reify the power structure of the current regime. Technological developments, on the other hand, are often oriented toward profit and change. There’s an inherent tension here. Laws may delay the development of technology and hence hurt the competitive advantage of an entrepreneur or even a state. Take the case of nanotechnology regulation in the European Union versus in the United States. European law so mitigates risks that it may end up limiting the technology’s potential, losing its competitive edge against the US. That’s another fact about the law: slow and reactive, it can be a gross annoyance. But ever since technological advances began speeding along on an exponential curve last century, the law has played a critical role in helping societies maintain certain previously negotiated standards for cohabitation. Our legal system may sometimes seem antiquated in today’s fast-moving world. But before changing our laws to accommodate new technologies that may (re)define our lives, it is important to have room for debate and time for social struggles to take place. The law serves this function of creative friction. It can restore human agency against fierce technological development. Given all the excitement over blockchain technologies, it is probable that interested parties will soon enough seek legal recognition and state-sanctioned enforceability of smart contracts. These emerging technologies are still too new to have been subjected to a sufficiently thorough analysis of their social, economic and political implications. More time is also needed to assess how blockchain could be deployed in a socially beneficial way. Blockchain technology seems poised to constitute an important component of tomorrow’s society. The legal system – slow-paced as it is – might be just what we need at this juncture to ensure that this new tool is deployed in a way consistent with established principles and values, with the common good at its core.::2017-05-03T06:26:38Z::Banking, Bitcoin, Blockchain, Global perspectives, Law, Technology, contract law, digital rights, smart contracts::Primavera de Filippi::Home::https://images.theconversation.com/files/167477/original/file-20170502-17260-t7ekia.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

The developers said the increased use of the Shibarium blockchain for transactions will result in a higher burn rate for the SHIB token, reducing supply. The SHIB price has risen 8.8% in the past 24 hours, in line with a broader market jump. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a measure of the wider crypto market, has rallied almost 7%. Users can now float new liquidity pools (LPs) on Shibarium, allowing traders to swap tokens on the network and earn a cut of trading fees for providing liquidity. ShibaSwap held over $25 million in locked tokens as of Thursday, data shows, with $1.7 million in trading volumes in the past 24 hours. “The more transactions will run on Shibarium blockchain, the more the protocol will burn base gas fees which will impact the overall burn rate of $SHIB,” they said. Burns refer to the permanent removal of tokens from circulating supply by sending them to an address that no one controls. Every swap and stake on ShibaSwap contributes to the ecosystem's growth as increased trading volumes bring higher fees for stakers and LP providers, developers said in an X post.

511::https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-halving-impact-on-layer-2s::Blockworks::article::How will the Bitcoin halving impact Bitcoin L2s?::Bitcoin will likely grow to rely on its layer-2 infrastructure a lot more for most post-halving transactions this year, experts say.::Bitcoin will likely grow to rely on its layer-2 infrastructure for most post-halving transactions this year, experts say Artwork by Crystal Le The Bitcoin halving is anticipated to occur in the second half of April this year. Like real-world gold, bitcoin is considered by many to be “digital gold,” with a maximum supply of 21 million coins. As the Bitcoin halving draws near, many are concerned that miners will endure an inevitable revenue cut following the major event. Mining bitcoin has previously been a profitable way for people to earn rewards while simultaneously securing the network. Fisher Yu is the co-founder of Babylon, a project aiming to create a Bitcoin-secured proof-of-stake economy. He noted the motivation behind early participation in Bitcoin’s proof-of-work security, attributing it to the high amount of bitcoin rewards available when the blockchain was first created. “Nakamoto’s hope is that, over time, Bitcoin becomes very well adopted so that the increase in transaction fee will outrun the reduction in mining rewards, so that miners’ operational costs are well covered,” Yu said. Read more: Why most bitcoin mining stocks are down amid a persistent crypto rally Although such a trend is observed, Yu notes that existing transaction fees are not quite sufficient, and there are growing concerns that miners may leave the network, reducing the blockchain’s overall security. This belief is shared by Max Chamberlin, the founder of next-gen EVM and layer-2 for Bitcoin, Bitfinity, who noted that many bitcoin mining businesses could become unsustainable following the halving. “While bitcoin’s mining difficulty is dynamic, automatically adjusting to the current hash rate capabilities, it would still be better for the network’s decentralization to have as many miners as possible,” Chamberlin said. Read more: 20% of bitcoin network hash rate could go offline after halving: Galaxy He notes that the emergence of Bitcoin Ordinals has boosted on-chain activity significantly and provided miners with a considerable new stream of income through transaction fees, which have so far amounted to almost $240 million. “In a broader sense, the introduction of ordinals and Runes has sparked considerable excitement within the cryptocurrency community in general, introducing a novel category of tokens — assets that exist directly on the Bitcoin blockchain,” Chamberlin said. Despite this, Chamberlin is aware that the Bitcoin ecosystem still needs to work on developing broad-spectrum, general-purpose applications, a challenge that stems primarily from the constraints of Bitcoin’s programming language, Script. “This predicament echoes a longstanding conundrum in finance — the emergence of new assets begs the question of what to do with them,” he said. Read more: The history of Bitcoin halvings — and why this time might look different He remarks that a potential solution to this concern is to integrate assets into DeFi services through Bitcoin layer-2 solutions, which often enable a more complex ecosystem of decentralized applications. “Bitfinity, a next-gen EVM serving as a layer-2 for Bitcoin and other assets, emerges as a strong contender in this regard. It provides developers with the familiar EVM programming environment but with access to Runes and other Bitcoin-native assets,” Chamberlin said. Yu agrees and explains that Babylon’s Bitcoin staking protocol could alleviate some of the growing concerns around cut rewards. He notes that miners could use their bitcoin to secure its proof-of-stake economy and be rewarded for their security.

Shah is the vice president of products and operations at Trust Machines, a company that is building a decentralized economy on Bitcoin. She told Blockworks that Bitcoin will likely grow to rely on its layer-2 infrastructure a lot more for most post-halving transactions this year. “While the base layer will still focus on high-value settlements, Bitcoin DeFi and other activities will no longer have to use the base layer, as more [layer-2s] start unlocking frictionless usability,” she said. She added that “solving transaction times, identity solutions and even wallet functionality between the [layer-1] and [layer-2s] are areas our team at Trust Machines has identified as most appealing to users. As well as DeFi opportunities, which are of particular interest to users of other smart contract-based chains.” Updated April 3, 2024 at 4:29 pm ET: Clarified to convey that references to “Bitfinity” are unrelated to Binance’s Bitfinity payments company.

512::https://coinatory.com/cryptocurrency-articles/invest-in-crypto-right-way-7367/::Coinatory::article::Smart Ways to Invest in Crypto: Essential Steps You Should Check Before Investing::Discover how to select the best cryptocurrency for buying and holding onto as a long-term investment. And learn how to avoid falling prey to scams.::“Invest in crypto,” – more and more people advice that nowadays. But is it easy to choose the best crypto to invest in? When many options are available, how do you choose between them? Several factors must be considered when deciding which cryptocurrency to invest in. It can be challenging to navigate, given the vast variety of available currencies. To help you find answers to this question, we have put together this guide. Monitoring current market capitalization is one technique to decide which crypto to invest in next. This will not only show which cryptos are ranked the highest right now but also the curve of their value.Keep track of global events that have an impact on cryptocurrency pricing. For instance, Elon Musk’s purchase of the social media site Twitter affected the price of other cryptocurrencies. Certain events make some cryptocurrencies more volatile than others do. Consider this when you decide – it can be both a pro and con. The cryptocurrency’s utility, or practical value, is an essential element that can significantly affect its value. In simple terms, if a cryptocurrency has more useful functions, it is likely to be more valuable. Conversely, if its use cases decrease, its value is likely to follow suit. Identifying the most promising use cases and those with the most market traction are crucial for making informed investment decisions. A cryptocurrency with a wide range of potential use cases, or those that have gained significant traction in the market, can be a positive sign for the investment portfolio. However, it is worth noting that the regulatory landscape of cryptocurrencies is constantly evolving. New regulations and restrictions can limit the use of cryptocurrencies. Therefore, staying informed about the regulatory environment is crucial for informed investment decisions in the dynamic cryptocurrency market. In summary, understanding the utility of a cryptocurrency is essential when deciding which crypto to invest in. Investing in a crypto with high-quality use cases or the potential for new ones can be a positive sign for your investment portfolio. However, staying up to date with the regulatory environment is equally important in making informed investment decisions in the crypto market. Always check whether the cryptocurrency you are thinking about investing in has a white paper. The coin, its uses, and its goals are covered in detail in the white paper, along with the technology that supports it. This will not only provide you with crucial details about the currency, but also reassure you of its genuineness. Generally, it is critical to pay close attention to the legitimacy of currencies and brokers in the current crypto market. The most important, the white paper on cryptocurrency is a vital document that investors need to examine before investing. It provides transparency, outlines the project’s goals and technical specifications, and explains the cryptocurrency use case. Without white papers, investors do not have the information they need to make informed investment decisions. It is crucial to assess whether a specific cryptocurrency has limited supply. Understanding the current number of coins in circulation and the extent to which they can be created through mining are equally important. These factors can impact the price of cryptocurrencies in the long term. An excellent illustration of this concept is that of Bitcoin. Bitcoin has a finite number of available coins, making it a valuable commodity as more people invest in it. An increase in demand for Bitcoin increases its value. However, if the demand remains the same, the value will change once there are no more bitcoins to mine. Therefore, it is essential to keep an eye on the supply and demand factors of cryptocurrencies to make informed investment decisions. To elaborate further, the limited supply of Bitcoin makes it a valuable asset. The Bitcoin mining process involves solving complex mathematical equations, which results in the creation of new coins. However, a finite number of coins can be created with a maximum of 21 million bitcoins in circulation. Once all 21 million Bitcoins are in circulation, no more can be created, and the only way to obtain Bitcoin is to buy it on exchange. This limited supply of Bitcoin makes it valuable, as the demand for Bitcoin increases with a growing number of investors. Consequently, the price of Bitcoin has increased dramatically over the years, making it a popular investment asset. Understanding supply and demand factors is vital when you want to invest in crypto.

Share this article US President candidate Donald Trump plans to offer his non-fungible token (NFT) community access to an exclusive NFT collection minted as Bitcoin Ordinals, according to a recent tweet from CollectTrumpCards, a Twitter handle for Trump’s NFTs. TRUMP DIGITAL TRADING CARDS on BITCOIN ORDINALS 🟧 The FIRST EVER Trump Trading Cards on Bitcoin. Read this thread ⬇️ — CollectTrumpCards (@CollectTrump) January 18, 2024 The new collection, limited to only 200 NFTs, is available to the first 200 buyers of the “Mugshot Edition” NFT collection, released in December 2023. Each mugshot NFT is priced at $99. CollectTrumpCards said that only 99 of these exclusive NFTs remain available for purchase, with transactions conducted in Wrapped Ether (WETH) via the platform CollectTrumpCards.com. 4. Of the 200, only 99 are left to purchase with Crypto (WETH) on https://t.co/vrpHbxyrFG (And if you’re one of the 101 that already Purchased, You'll get your Ordinal!). — CollectTrumpCards (@CollectTrump) January 18, 2024 The company noted that these NFTs, including the “Mugshot Edition,” are intended solely for collection purposes and should not be seen as investment opportunities or political statements. Moreover, all Mugshot NFTs are restricted from trading until December 31, 2024. The “Mugshot Edition” has a unique theme centered around Trump’s life and career, including a photograph from his arrest in late August. This collection not only offers a glimpse into these personal moments but also provides exclusive opportunities for fans. Buyers who purchase at least 47 Trump cards will have the chance to attend a dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago and receive a piece of the suit he wore during his arrest. Some of these NFTs might even bear Trump’s signature. Before launching the Mugshot NFTs, Trump had introduced two other NFT collections, which were sold out and generated massive revenue. According to a report by the legal advocacy group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, Trump’s holdings in Ethereum, primarily accumulated from these NFT sales, were valued at $5 million.

514::https://theconversation.com/blockchain-is-useful-for-a-lot-more-than-just-bitcoin-58921::The Conversation::article::Blockchain is useful for a lot more than just Bitcoin::While Bitcoin gets all the attention, the blockchain technology it’s based on could have applications across business and government.::Blockchain technology is not just useful for creating digital currencies such as Bitcoin or developing new financial technologies. Blockchains can be used for a wide variety of applications, such as tracking ownership or the provenance of documents, digital assets, physical assets or voting rights. Blockchain technology was popularised by the Bitcoin digital currency system. But, essentially, a blockchain is just a special kind of database. The Bitcoin blockchain stores cryptographically signed records of financial transfers, but blockchain systems can store any kind of data. Blockchains can also store and run computer code called “smart contracts”. What makes a blockchain system special is that it doesn’t run on just one computer like a regular database. Rather, many distributed processing nodes collaborate to run it. There can be a full copy of the database on every node, and the system encourages all those nodes to establish a consensus about its contents. This boosts our confidence in the database and its contents. It’s difficult, if not impossible, to meddle with the database without others finding out and correcting it. The global consensus among the nodes about the integrity and contents of the distributed database is why it’s often called a “distributed ledger”. In our society, we normally rely on trusted third parties, such as lawyers, courts, banks and governments to process and keep authoritative records about commercial transactions. These transactions aren’t just about financial transfers, but also include the creation or transfer of physical assets, shareholdings, certifications, digital rights, intellectual property or even votes. These third parties are trusted because we rely on them. If they fail or lie, we suffer. We tend to trust the third parties for reasons that are external to the database; lawyers are accredited; votes are counted by independent monitors; and courts run to established laws for matters such as oversight and the possibility of appeal. Blockchains are interesting because the integrity of the contents of the distributed ledger does not rely on any specific individual or organisation. So, rather than relying on trusted third-party organisations to facilitate these commercial transactions, we might instead rely on a trusted blockchain system. This means blockchains give us new opportunities to rethink how parts of our society work. Innovation here might reduce friction in the economy, or create new kinds of services and ways of doing business with each other. Whether or not blockchain systems are trustworthy is an interesting question. The reasons for believing that blockchain systems won’t fail or lie would be based on our understanding of the underlying software technologies. It also depends on our understanding of market incentives that influence behaviour of the many distributed processing nodes that run blockchains. However, blockchain technologies are still new in the scheme of things, and the community is still discovering their risks, limitations and potential economic and social impact. Because blockchain technology is so new, it’s difficult to predict exactly how they will end up being used. This is why we at Data61 in CSIRO are exploring new ways blockchains can be used across industries. To understand the economic and societal opportunities presented by blockchain technology, we also need to understand its technological risks and limitations. At Data61, we plan to identify, develop and evaluate some “proof of concept” systems using blockchains to investigate them. A recent UK government report on blockchain technologies provides a good overview and examples of the use of blockchain. One of these is Everledger, a company founded by Australian woman Leanne Kemp. Everledger uses a blockchain to record information about the provenance and ownership of individual diamonds and other valuables. Here, rather than the blockchain recording transfers of digital currency, it records transfers of ownership of identified physical assets. This globally accessible provenance trail could reduce fraud and theft, and enable new or improved kinds of insurance and finance services. The same general idea could be used for any supply chain, such as in retail, agriculture or pharmaceuticals. The drivers for improving assurance of supply chain quality vary in different industries. It could be brand reputation in retail, or safety in pharmaceuticals, or a combination in agriculture. It is worth observing that blockchains don’t totally do away with the need for trusted third parties. A blockchain is only a digital record, but we need others to determine if those records actually match the corresponding physical assets in the real world. Everledger relies on major diamond certification companies to measure identifying information about individual diamonds. These measurements can be independently cross-checked. But in some sense, companies such as these become trusted third parties for this blockchain-based system. One can imagine the adoption of blockchain technologies creating opportunities for new kinds of trusted third-party organisations. Underlying all of these applications is the need for data integrity, which is the key security property for commercial systems, and the primary property for blockchain technologies. For financial transactions, data integrity means you can’t spend money you don’t have, and you can’t spend money twice. For physical supply chains, this means you can’t fraudulently acquire record of ownership for an asset. However, other security properties, such as privacy and confidentiality, are also important in many application areas. To achieve confidentiality, other mechanisms such as cryptography must be used in conjunction with the blockchain. Part of our software architecture research at Data61 is to seek to understand how design choices for software-based systems affect tradeoffs for qualities including security (integrity, confidentiality, privacy), performance (latency, throughput and scalability), and others. Good design choices can control risks to achieving these qualities, and this is part of what is evaluated in our research using proof-of-concept systems. Computer programs are a special kind of data and so can be stored in a database. That means we can store programs in the distributed ledger of a blockchain system, and execute those programs while later transactions are being processed. In the Ethereum blockchain, these programs can be highly complex. These programs are normally called “smart contracts”. Smart contracts can carry value, and can conditionally transfer that value according to complex business conditions based on the latest state of the distributed ledger. This means blockchain systems can do more than store information about commercial transactions; they can also process commercial transactions too. This greatly expands the opportunities for using blockchain systems. Although smart contracts are often thought of as standing for self-executing legal contracts, they are written in a general purpose programming language and can be used to implement a wide range of business logic. Can smart contracts actually stand as legal contracts? This is an interesting question. For legal contracts to be enforceable, they need to be understandable by reasonable persons. Can the bytecode of a program stored on a blockchain really be understood by any human? Perhaps only obsessive hobbyists might be able to develop that skill! Another thread of research in Data61 is investigating new ways of representing and analysing smart contracts, using recent results from legal informatics. Blockchain technology is still in its infancy. There are a wide range of plausible future scenarios for their future impact, ranging from efficiency improvements for commercial transactions through to a complete reinvention of the economy. As with any disruptive technology, understanding the plausible, possible and probable impacts – the opportunities and risks – will be vital for wise policy, strategy, and design choices by Australian governments and companies.::2016-05-09T20:04:28Z::Bitcoin, Blockchain, Finance, Fintech, contract law::Mark Staples::Home::https://images.theconversation.com/files/121656/original/image-20160509-23367-kxbc3k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=345%2C0%2C2178%2C1059&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

The softer-than-expected U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.3% versus 0.4% in March amid economist forecasts for 0.4%, triggering a breakout for BTC. The asset regained the $66,000 mark for the first time since April and posted its biggest single-day gain since March. Such a move, coupled with demand from traditional finance, could see bitcoin regaining its March record of $73,700. “We expect bullish momentum here that could take us back to the highs of nearly $74,000,” QCP traders said. “The desk saw sizeable buyers of $100K-$120k BTC Calls for Dec 2024 on this move higher in spot.” “Institutional demand for bitcoin continues to grow, with large asset managers Millennium and Schonfeld investing approximately 3% and 2% of their AUM into the BTC spot ETF,” they added. Multiple filings on Wednesday showed that several big-name funds, such as Millenium Management and Elliot Capital, held millions worth of bitcoin ETFs in their portfolios. Meanwhile, some analysts say the selling pressure on bitcoin appears to have eased off, citing on-chain and exchange data. “Short-term Bitcoin holders are selling at basically zero profit and traders are depleting their unrealized profits in the last few months,” CryptoQuant analysts shared in a Thursday report. “Bitcoin balances at OTC desks stabilizing, which suggests there is less Bitcoin supply coming into the market to sell via these entities.” The firm defines short-term traders as addresses that hold bitcoin for less than 155 days and are likely to capitalize on short-term price movements. A breakout in bitcoin comes after weeks of low volatility. Since March, the market has been range-bound between $60,000 and $70,000, with the halving event in April not providing the expected boost due to a general lack of market catalysts, traders have previously said. Higher risk appetite for token bets showed signs of beginning earlier this week after an X post by retail trader Keith Gill sent some meme stocks and meme coins surging. Gill's online persona and investment strategies contributed to a short squeeze on video game retailer GameStop’s stock in 2021, and his first post on social application X in three years was considered by some to be a sign of market volatility in the months ahead.

516::https://beincrypto.com/altcoin-listing-korea-largest-crypto-exchange/::BeInCrypto::article::The Largest Crypto Exchange in Korea Listed These Two Altcoins::Korea's largest crypto exchange, lists two altcoins, driving notable market gains and showcasing innovative blockchain solutions.::We use cookies to improve your experience.  Upbit, the titan of South Korea’s cryptocurrency exchange market, has once again made headlines. This time, it is for listing two notable altcoins, Altlayer (ALT) and Pyth Network (PYTH). These additions to the Korean Won (KRW) and Bitcoin (BTC) markets have stirred significant interest and speculation among investors and crypto aficionados. At 09:00 UTC on February 27, 2024, ALT’s BTC pair entered the Upbit market. Upbit has decided to support ALT exclusively on the Ethereum network for deposits. With this decision, the exchange aims to offer a streamlined and secure trading environment. Moreover, it is important to note that this ALT is distinct from ArchLoot (ALT), which is traded on other platforms. Similarly, Pyth Network (PYTH) was listed against the KRW and BTC trading pairs, with its trading kicking off alongside ALT. By supporting PYTH through the Solana network, Upbit underlines its dedication to facilitating reliable transactions. Upbit has implemented specific guidelines and limitations to ensure market stability. For instance, initial buy orders are closely regulated, with predetermined thresholds for sell orders. These measures aim to prevent market manipulation and excessive volatility. Therefore, they reflect Upbit’s proactive approach to safeguarding its trading environment. The inclusion of ALT and PYTH highlights the potential of these altcoins. ALT, with its Rollup as a Service (RaaS) and Actively Validated Service (AVS infrastructure), offers a new paradigm for projects aiming to develop rollups without deep blockchain knowledge. Meanwhile, PYTH is pioneering by connecting off-chain financial data with on-chain Dapps, enriching the DeFi ecosystem. The market’s response to these listings has been overwhelmingly positive. For example, PYTH saw a surge of over 40% on the announcement day and an overall rally of more than 110% in February. ALT also demonstrated strong performance, with a 25% increase on the day of listing and an 80% rally within the month. “PYTH is moving as planned. I guess we’re definitely smashing above a dollar sooner than I expected,” DeFi analyst Dave Spike said. Read more: 13 Best Altcoins To Invest In February 2024 These trends reflect the significant impact Upbit’s listings can have on crypto asset valuations. However, amidst the excitement, a word of caution remains relevant. The crypto market’s inherent volatility, speculative demand, and regulatory shifts present risks that investors must consider carefully.

517::https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-halving-inflation-and-issuance-schedule::Blockworks::article::Why is 2140 the end of bitcoin inflation?::The final Bitcoin halving, where the mining reward becomes smaller than one satoshi, is expected to occur in 2140.::The final Bitcoin halving, where the mining reward becomes smaller than one satoshi, is expected to occur in 2140 Artwork by Crystal Le It’s well known that the Bitcoin network experiences a halving of supply approximately every four years. Less appreciated is that these are set to continue for over a century into the future. Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto programmed the year 2140 — 30 halvings from now — as the year that the block rewards (the subsidy paid to miners for processing transactions into blocks) would drop to less than one satoshi, the smallest unit of bitcoin. The use of the term “satoshi” — equivalent to 100 millionth of a bitcoin (or 0.00000001 BTC) — emerged organically among early Bitcoin users and developers, appearing in various forums and discussions starting in 2010 or 2011, and became widely accepted in 2013. Read more: The Bitcoin halving is about a month away — here’s what you can expect The halving is modeled after the physical mining of scarce resources, according to Jameson Lopp, co-founder and chief security officer at Casa. “There’s nothing special about the year 2140,” Lopp told Blockworks. “It’s just how the nature of halvings along with the level of precision of satoshis ended up working out.” Lopp notes that Nakamoto explained the supply schedule to Mike Hearn, a former Google engineer who became an early Bitcoin contributor, in 2009: “My choice for the number of coins and distribution schedule was an educated guess,” Satoshi wrote. “I wanted to pick something that would make prices similar to existing currencies, but without knowing the future, that’s very hard.” Read more: Satoshi warned against labeling bitcoin as an ‘investment’ He picked 21 million, but Satoshi added that the divisibility of a bitcoin in practice could be represented differently depending on how valuable one bitcoin gets. “For example, if 0.001 is worth one euro, then it might be easier to change where the decimal point is displayed, so if you had one bitcoin it’s now displayed as 1000, and 0.001 is displayed as one.” For what it’s worth, 0.001 BTC is worth about 65 euros (approximately $70) today. Why the rate of issuance would decline for 132 years, however, was never explained. “I expect it was more of a ‘better safe than sorry’ decision to give the system decades to bootstrap,” Lopp said. Unless the price of bitcoin (BTC) doubles every four years, each halving brings less income from block rewards to miners. So to maintain the network’s hashrate, which is important for Bitcoin’s security, transaction fees will become more important over time. Whether that will happen in practice remains to be seen, but Lopp is optimistic. “I expect that as we see the multi-layered Bitcoin ecosystem continue to expand, the base chain will start to look more and more like a high-value cryptographic accumulator and it will make economic sense for on-chain transactions to pay relatively high fees,” he said.

518::https://coinatory.com/cryptocurrency-articles/crypto-lending-crypto-loans-7118/::Coinatory::article::Crypto lending - All you need to know about crypto loans::Looking to learn about crypto lending and how to profit from it? Discover what crypto lending is, how it works, and how you can earn money from it!::Crypto lending is the act of depositing cryptocurrency to be lent to borrowers in exchange for recurrent interest payment. Payments are made in the form of cryptocurrency, which is commonly deposited and compounded every day, every week, or every month. Decentralized and centralized crypto lenders are the two primary categories of crypto lending platforms. Both provide access to high interest rates, often as high as 20% annual percentage yield (APY), and both typically need depositing collateral in order to get a crypto loan. The opportunity to lend out cryptocurrency and earn interest in the form of cryptocurrency incentives is made available through cryptocurrency lending platforms for investors. In 2020, lending platforms gained popularity, and since then, the total value of loans locked on different platforms has increased to billions. There are two parts to cryptocurrency lending: interest-bearing deposits and loans. Similar to a bank account, deposit accounts have similar functions. The lending platform accepts cryptocurrency deposits from users and pays interest of up to 8% APY (depending on the platform and the cryptocurrency). Deposited money might be used by the platform to make loans to borrowers or for other kinds of investments. In order to borrow money or cryptocurrency, borrowers normally have to deposit at least 100% (and sometimes up to 150%, depending on the lender) in cryptocurrency as collateral. The interest rates differ by platform and require for monthly payments, much like with traditional loans. In contrast to conventional loans, cryptocurrency loans have durations as short as seven days and as long as 180 days, with an hourly interest rate, like Binance. Some lenders, like Nexo, which offers 0% APR, provide an endless line of credit in their place. There are several types of cryptocurrency loans available: Some services provide a cryptocurrency line of credit rather than a standard loan with a defined term length. Users can borrow up to a specific amount of the deposited collateral using this kind of collateralized loan, but there are no specified terms for repayment, and they just pay interest on the money they withdraw. Collateralized loans are the most popular and require deposited cryptocurrency that is used as collateral for the loan. The majority of platforms demand overcollateralization, which limits how much of the deposited collateral borrowers can access (usually below a 90% loan-to-value). The interest rate and the likelihood of having your margin called are both lower the lower the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. Flash loans are typically available on crypto exchanges and are instant loans that are borrowed and repaid in the same transaction. These are very high-risk loans that are typically used to take advantage of market arbitrage opportunities, such as buying cryptocurrency for a lower price in one market and instantly selling for a higher price in another, all within the same transaction Uncollateralized loans are not as popular, but they function similarly to personal loans. Borrowers must fill out a loan application, pass identity verification, and complete a creditworthiness review to be approved. These loans have a higher risk of loss for lenders because there is no collateral to liquidate in the event of a loan default. Due to the loans’ and deposited funds’ dependence on the constantly erratic cryptocurrency market, lending in the cryptocurrency space is inherently dangerous for both borrowers and lenders. Crypto aficionados are less than thrilled as a result of the recent Celsius fiasco, which resulted in the overnight freezing of billions of dollars in deposits. Here are a few of the risks of crypto lending: Though some crypto loans offer low rates, most crypto loans charge over 5% APR, with some charging up to 13% APR (or more). Crypto assets often become unaccessible and illiquid when they are deposited onto crypto loan services. While some cryptocurrency lending services permit lenders to access deposited funds reasonably quickly, others may necessitate a protracted waiting period. A decrease in the value of the deposited collateral might result in a margin call when customers pledge collateral and borrow against it. When the LTV of a cryptocurrency loan falls below the agreed-upon rate, this occurs. When this occurs, borrowers have two options: they can either add more collateral to bring the LTV back down or they can risk liquidation. Platforms for crypto lending are unregulated and do not provide the same level of protection that banks do. For instance, user money up to that amount are safeguarded in the event that a bank goes bankrupt since U.S. bank deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for up to $250,000 per depositor. There are no user protections for cryptocurrency lending platforms that have solvency problems, and money may be lost. Users must register for a centralized lending platform (like BlockFi) or link a digital wallet to a decentralized lending platform in order to submit an application for a cryptocurrency loan (such as Aave). Users will next choose the type of loan and the desired loan amount before choosing the collateral to deposit. The amount that is available will change depending on the collateral and deposit. The borrowed cash will quickly move to the user’s account or digital wallet after the user deposits the collateral into the platform’s digital wallet. The majority of loans give quick approval, and smart contracts are used to lock in loan conditions. Users must register for a lending platform, choose a supported cryptocurrency to deposit, then pay money to the platform in order to become a crypto lender. Interest can be paid in kind or with the native platform token on a centralized crypto lending platform. Interest is paid out in kind on a decentralized exchange, but there may also be bonus payments. Lending cryptocurrency is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, the majority of loans are secured by collateral, so even in the case of a default, lenders can recover their losses through liquidation. In comparison to conventional bank accounts, they also offer deposits at substantially greater interest rates. On the other hand, there are no legal safeguards for investors, giving lending companies the authority to arbitrarily lock consumers’ funds in place, as Celsius has done. Borrowers run the danger of collateral losing value and having to be liquidated, which would result in a substantially smaller return on their investment. Regulators from all around the world are focusing on lending platforms; rules are emerging around deposit accounts, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) even fined BlockFi $100 million for breaking securities laws. Ultimately, crypto lending can be secure for careful users, but both borrowers and investors face significant dangers. A platform that provides lending and borrowing services that are controlled by smart contracts is known as decentralized finance (DeFi) lending. Decentralized apps (dApps) enable customers to link a digital wallet, deposit collateral, and instantly access funds. DeFi loans are instantaneous. DeFi lending enables customers to deposit cryptocurrency using a digital wallet and begin earning interest right away, with the interest often compounding every minute. The majority of DeFi lending platforms mandate overcollateralization, requiring deposits of at least 110% of the loan amount. The deposit of collateral receives income even when it is tied to a loan, which is how DeFi differs from centralized systems. Users can earn a large amount of interest on their crypto deposits when they make them on a lending platform, often more than they can at regular banks. The money that is deposited is loaned to borrowers who cover a portion of the interest, and it can also be invested in other ways to increase yield.

Share this article With Ordinals taking center stage, Bitcoin dominated the NFT market last month, accounting for more than half of the overall monthly NFT sales. According to data from CryptoSlam, Bitcoin NFT sales surged to a record high of over $880 million in December, outpacing major platforms like Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon. The number of buyers and sellers skyrocketed by 140%, with over 9,000 buyers and 10,000 sellers joining the market. While Bitcoin dominated, Ethereum experienced a decline in NFT sales, dropping by 15.57% to reach $350 million. In contrast, Solana also saw a remarkable 250% growth, though its total sales still trailed those of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Arbitrum also showcased significant growth, with a 180% surge in NFT sales. The most valuable NFT sold was Van Gogh’s Painting #216, fetching $1.19 million. This NFT is part of a Bitcoin-powered NFT collection created to pay tribute to the renowned artist. Two other artworks from the same collection, #132 and #283, were sold earlier for $1.3 million and $1.27 million, respectively. Overall, while global NFT sales surpassed $1.7 billion last month, this volume remains significantly below its peak of $5.5 billion back in August 2021. Ordinals have played an essential role in the recent surge in Bitcoin’s NFT sales. Introduced in September 2022, this new technology allows users to inscribe digital items, including images, videos, and music, directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain. BitMEX reported over 13,000 Ordinals transactions were processed within the first two months, consuming 526MB of Bitcoin blockspace. Advocates such as Bitcoin developer Udi Wertheimer or MicroStrategy’s co-founder Michael Saylor champion Ordinals for boosting Bitcoin’s sustainability. However, not all Bitcoin community members agree. Luke Dashjr, a Bitcoin Core developer, argues that these inscriptions exploit a vulnerability in the data size limit, potentially leading to network spam.

520::https://theconversation.com/centrelink-data-matching-problems-show-the-need-for-a-government-blockchain-71156::The Conversation::article::Centrelink data-matching problems show the need for a government blockchain::The problems with Centrelink’s data-matching system stem from reconciling datasets held by different agencies. What if we used a blockchain to create a single source of data?::Governments across the globe are experimenting with the blockchain, the technology behind Bitcoin, as a way to reduce costs and provide more accountability to the public. In Europe alone, the United Kingdom, Ukraine and Estonia are experimenting with blockchains to fight corruption and deliver public services. Australia, too, is looking at what a blockchain might achieve. The recent problems with Centrelink’s automated data-matching system show precisely where a government blockchain would fit in. Rather than siloing our data in government agencies, we could create a single source of information. This would speed up our interactions with government, while reducing errors and fraud. The blockchain is a kind of public database, one stored simultaneously on a bunch of different computers. When a new transaction occurs it is verified (otherwise known as “mining” or “consensus”), encrypted and added to the database. The most famous example of the blockchain is Bitcoin, a crypto-currency built upon the blockchain. However, the blockchain is suitable for many other applications, not just financial transactions. For example, the blockchain could be used to authenticate that a diamond has not come from an illict source, or for buying and selling property. For the government’s purposes, the killer feature of the blockchain is that it is a way to record transactions so that they are transparent and cannot be altered or tampered with. When used to track fish through a supply chain, for instance, it allows customers and restaurants to follow where the fish has been and have confidence in the data. When applied to a government context, these capabilities could be useful for collecting tax, delivering benefits, or regulating business. From the public’s point of view, this could enable us to track government spending, eliminate fraudulent transactions, reduce errors in data processing and speed up service delivery to almost real time. It could be useful almost anywhere records are kept. All the while the public could be more confident about the accuracy and integrity of the data being held. The Australian government makes benefit payments and provides support services through Medicare, Centrelink and Child Support services. It also collects information through numerous other agencies, such as the Australian Tax Office. A government blockchain could record the transactions about a citizen and link together information about health, welfare and child support. The information would be entered only once into the blockchain by any one of these agencies. There would be no need for the data to be re-entered or matched again. Thus errors that occur in data processing as information is passed on down the line will be eliminated, avoiding some of the issues with the current Centrelink system. Further, once data is entered it cannot be altered or changed in any way without proper authentication. Any authorised officer within the government could then access the information in the blockchain, avoiding a paper-pushing exercise between government departments. All of your data would be in one place. We could go even further, as the blockchain would also allow other services to be processed through an app, as the UK is trialling with welfare payments. The overall cost savings, reduction in bureaucracy and increased responsiveness to helping people in need could be immense. All we need is the government to invest in its own blockchain. The essence of a blockchain is to reduce the reliance on centralised systems (such as the government), replacing it with a system with inherent accountability, transparency and trust. The original blockchain concept achieved this by being open, like the internet (also known as unpermissioned), relying on independent, anonymous “miners” to validate transactions. This guarantees the integrity of the data as no-one knows who the miners are to bribe or bully them into underhanded actions. However, some might view a government-run, “permissioned” blockchain with suspicion. The trust of the public would need to be gained. A government blockchain would not be open, and we would have to rely on the government to approve all of the transactions. This negates some of the benefit offered by a blockchain. The legitimacy and trust would have to come from the government itself. Thus a government-run blockchain would not be without its challenges. But if an Australian government blockchain is developed and allowed to succeed, then the potential benefits could be enormous. Society as we know it will be disrupted!::2017-01-13T05:07:21Z::Blockchain, Centrelink, Data matching, Digital governance, Government data, Medicare::Christine Helliar::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/152614/original/image-20170113-11198-1htvjsm.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C85%2C2995%2C1455&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
521::https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/16/ether-bitcoin-ratio-slides-to-lowest-since-april-2021-heres-why/::CoinDesk::article::Ether-Bitcoin Ratio Slides to Lowest Since April 2021. Here's Why::"Ether is a 'lightning rod' for negative sentiment from crypto native and external players and has several weak spots," one observer said.::The ratio between ether (ETH) and bitcoin’s (BTC) dollar-denominated prices continues to slide, extending year-to-date losses as suggested by the bearish death cross pattern a month ago. ETH/BTC slipped to 0.04563 on crypto exchange Binance soon before press time, reaching the lowest since April 2021, according to charting platform TradingView. This year, the ratio has declined nearly 16%, indicating a bias for bitcoin or the leading cryptocurrency by market value. The slide to three-year lows follows reduced demand for exchange-traded products (ETPs) tied to ether. According to Bloomberg data quoted by ETC Group in its weekly report, global ether ETPs registered net outflows of around $63.5 million last week, with Hong Kong-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) losing the most. Meanwhile, bitcoin ETPs raked in $92.5 million last week. Several factors, including competing layer 1s and lingering uncertainty about the debut of spot ETH approvals in the U.S, are likely responsible for ETH falling out of investor favor. “The approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has reinforced bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative and its status as a macro asset. On the other hand, open questions about ETH’s fundamental positioning within the crypto sector remain. Competing layer-1s (L1s) like Solana detract from Ethereum’s positioning as the 'go-to' network for decentralized app (dApp) deployment,” Coinbase Institutional’s Research analyst David Han said in a note Wednesday. Solana’s share in total decentralized exchange volumes has grown tenfold from 2% to 21% in one year, eating into Ethereum's market share. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) green-lighted nearly a dozen spot BTC ETFs in January. Since then, these funds have drawn roughly $12 billion in net inflows, according to data source Farside Investors. Approval of spot ETFs tied to ether will open a similar pool of capital for Ethereum’s native token, although it’s unclear when the SEC will approve it. Traders on decentralized betting platform Polymarket see just a 10% chance of the SEC approving a spot ETF on or before May 31. The regulator has until May 23 to decide whether to approve or reject VanEck’s application to launch a spot Ethereum ETF. The deadline for BlackRock’s application is June 23. According to finance lawyer Scott Johnsson, the SEC is looking for reasons to deny ETH ETF applications by BlackRock and others on grounds that they have been improperly filed as commodity-based trust shares and do not qualify if they hold a security. Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex Solutions, said ether is a "lightning rod" for negative sentiment from crypto native and external players and has several weak spots. “Capital gets fragmented. There are proportionally greater numbers of ways to get exposure to the ecosystem through the many Layer 2s tokens (OP, ARB…) and native protocol tokens in each one. The capital gets fragmented," Solot said in an email. Solot added that strong anti-ETH sentiment from [rival] Solana community and Bitcoin propounders is driving negative ether narratives and the high beta cryptocurrency is a "perfect vehicle" for external players to express bearish view given it trades on traditional exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Lastly, Ether recently turned inflationary, reversing the bullish deflationary supply trend seen consistently since its parent network Ethereum transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus ecosystem in September 2022.

522::https://beincrypto.com/three-altcoin-breakout-bitcoin-peaks/::BeInCrypto::article::Altcoin Season: These 3 Crypto Are Poised to Break Out as Bitcoin Soars::As Bitcoin soars to $64,000, experts eye three crypto assets for significant breakouts in the altcoin season.::We use cookies to improve your experience.  As the cryptocurrency market watches Bitcoin’s recent surge to $64,000, attention shifts toward altcoins poised for breakouts. Brian Kelly, CEO of hedge fund BKCM, suggests a potential rotation from Bitcoin invention to promising altcoins. The community searches for the next hot crypto trend as Bitcoin’s price surge approaches the all-time highs. Solana (SOL) stands out as Brian Kelly’s top pick for investment rotation from Bitcoin and Ethereum. Its solid technological foundation and practical applications make it an attractive option for investors looking for growth beyond the market leaders. Indeed, Solana’s potential has not gone unnoticed, with its functionality and speed drawing significant interest. “I am actually doing a rotation from Bitcoin and Ethereum into Solana,” Kelly told CNBC. Furthermore, Chainlink captures the spotlight with its recent adoption by Ark Invest and 21Shares for the ARKB Bitcoin ETF. This integration of Chainlink’s Proof of Reserve platform aims to enhance transparency and security for investors. Consequently, Chainlink’s price witnessed an encouraging surge, signaling growing investor confidence in its technology. Chainlink’s strategic partnerships underscore the crypto industry’s move towards more secure and transparent investment products. This boosts Chainlink’s market presence and enhances the crypto market’s overall credibility. Moreover, according to The Motley Fool, Polkadot presents a compelling case as an undervalued asset in the crypto space. Its focus on interoperability and its pivotal role in Web3 infrastructure suggest substantial growth potential. Despite its modest gains compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum, Polkadot’s innovative approach positions it as a key player in the future of decentralized internet. Read more: 13 Best Altcoins To Invest In February 2024 Polkadot’s undervaluation, contrasted with its significant contributions to Web3, presents a unique opportunity for investors. Its interoperability focus is crucial for developing a decentralized internet, marking it as an asset with long-term value. Transitioning to these altcoins reflects a broader market trend towards diversification and strategic investment in projects with solid fundamentals.

523::https://blockworks.co/news/mining-firms-prepare-for-bitcoin-halving::Blockworks::article::The Bitcoin halving is just weeks away — here’s how miners have prepared::Public mining companies have been acquiring sites, refreshing machine fleets and diversifying business models in preparation for the event.::Public mining companies have been acquiring sites, refreshing machine fleets and diversifying business models in preparation for the event Konstantin Yolshin/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks Mining companies are bracing themselves for the Bitcoin halving — a time expected to weed out the segment’s less efficient operators, and those with trouble accessing capital. Per-block mining rewards are set to drop from 6.25 bitcoin (BTC) to 3.125 BTC on or around April 20. Such an event occurs roughly every four years. Read more: The next Bitcoin halving is coming. Here’s what you need to know While some industry players are expected to struggle, other firms have made it clear they intend to take advantage of buying opportunities and set themselves up for future growth. Such vision takes preparation, and miner moves have been aplenty in recent months. While some miners have already started acquiring properties, others have focused on buying new and more efficient machines. Cutting costs and diversifying revenue sources has been another strategy used by various companies. Let’s take a deeper look. While a bunch of the larger mining companies have signaled the intent to be opportunistic in a post-halving world, some have already started to buy properties. Compass Point research and trading analyst Joe Flynn has referred to Marathon Digital as “the 800-pound gorilla” in the mining space. Indeed, the company sported an energized hash rate of 28.7 exahashes per second (EH/s) as of Feb. 29, and has no plans to slow down. The company closed its acquisition of two mining facilities in Texas and Nebraska in January. Marathon more recently revealed its intent to buy a Texas bitcoin mining facility owned by Applied Digital for roughly $87 million. CleanSpark has also bought facilities this year — completing its acquisition of three data centers in Mississippi last month. The purchases — as part of a $19.8 million cash deal — were set to expand CleanSpark’s operating hash rate by 2.4 EH/s. Bitfarms bought land in Yguazu, Paraguay in January for a planned 100 megawatt (MW) facility. Near the Itaipú Dam, the facility — to boost Bitfarms’ portfolio of “low-cost renewable hydropower” — is set to be completed in the second half of 2024, the company said at the time. Buying mining machines was a trend in 2023, as a dozen or so public mining companies committed more than $1 billion in purchase orders, according to BlocksBridge Consulting data. Read more: Crypto miners keep busy ahead of halving with accelerated machine buys Among the larger purchases was Riot Platforms’ buy of 66,560 MicroBT machines for $290.5 million in December — amounting to 18 EH/s of mining capacity. Riot then bought 31,500 more miners from MicroBT last month, for $97.4 million. About 17,000 of those machines were set to replace “under-performing” miners in its Rockdale, TX facility, Riot CEO Jason Les said at the time. Others have followed suit with acquiring and deploying new machines that improve the company’s mining efficiency. Bitfarms revealed in November it had ordered 35,888 Bitmain T21 miners as part of a so-called “transformative fleet upgrade” — with deliveries slated between March and May. The company then agreed to buy nearly 52,000 more machines earlier this month. “Securing these miners now is a key part of our strategy to drive rapid and meaningful improvements across our three key operating metrics of hashrate, energy efficiency and operating costs per terahash with a plan to capture greater upside from rising bitcoin prices with rapidly expanding mining margins,” Bitfarms CEO Geoff Morphy said in a statement. The latest Bitfarms purchase came just days after the company said it planned to sell common shares of the company to gain proceeds of up to $375 million. Bitmain agreed to invest $53 million in Core Scientific in September ahead of Core’s emergence out of bankruptcy in January. That Bitmain deal was set to supply the mining company with 27,000 Bitmain S19J bitcoin mining servers — totaling 4.1 EH/s of hash rate. Core Scientific said earlier this month that it completed the payments due in 2024 for its S19J and S21 machines. CleanSpark bought 4.4 EH/s worth of Antminer machines in October, while New York-based Cipher Mining purchased 16,700 Avalon A1466 miners from Canaan in January. Most recently, Singapore-headquartered Bitdeer said Tuesday it was set to install new SEALMINER A1 miners as part of an initial 3.4 EH/s expansion in Texas and Norway. The company said it would be retiring older mining rigs as part of the upgrade. While growth is critical, not all miners are seeking to expand at all costs. Just ask Hut 8. The company merged with US Bitcoin Corp. in November. It then named US Bitcoin Corp. co-founder Asher Genoot as Hut 8’s new CEO, replacing Jaime Leverton. Hut 8 said earlier this month it would cease mining operations at its Drumheller site in Alberta, Canada as part of a larger effort to cut inefficiencies. “I’m going through not just every single facility, every single category of miners and every single business line, but also every single cost center,” Genoot previously told Blockworks. Read more: Hut 8 eyes growth around the Bitcoin halving — but not at all costs Diversifying revenue streams, as well as exploring new geographies, has also been a focus for some segment players. Miners have increasingly looked to support the high-performance computing (HPC) and AI sectors. Hive Digital Technologies rebranded last July as part of a pivot to HPC, while Hut 8 has said it also plans to boost its footprint in the growing AI infrastructure and computing markets in the coming years. Earlier this month, Core Scientific said it would lease up to 16 MW of capacity in its Austin data center to cloud provider CoreWeave. Possible revenue via the CoreWeave deal exceeds $100 million, the company said. Geographic diversity is also a way some miners have looked to gain an edge. Marathon Digital expanded into Abu Dhabi and Paraguay last year — and signaled it is looking into Africa as another possible spot to set up operations. Charlie Schumacher, Marathon’s vice president of corporate communications, previously told Blockworks that expanding into new regions can help improve margins and reduce concentration risk in the business. The big public miners have noted that building up balance sheet strength has been crucial as executives expect there to be more buying opportunities post-halving. Ultimately, segment observers note that bitcoin miner consolidation appears imminent. Marathon executives said during a February earnings call they would look to use the firm’s balance sheet — with roughly $1 billion worth of unrestricted cash and bitcoin, as of Jan. 31 — to nearly double the firm’s hash rate to 50 EH/s by the end of 2025.

The company intends to use that capital to help it reach 38 EH/s by the end of 2025, Riot executives note. Core Scientific CEO Adam Sullivan told Blockworks that the company is set to focus on opportunistically buying machines from struggling miners unable to afford parts of their existing orders after the halving.

The company’s recently announced 63 MW build-out in Texas was expected to cost $275,000 per megawatt — roughly 40% less than the roughly $460,000 per megawatt that Marathon spent on two mining facilities in December. “We’re very active in the M&A markets, but we’re also very cost-conscious,” Genoot said previously. “We’re not going to overpay because we know what the cost is to develop ourselves as well, so we’re running both in parallel very aggressively.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

524::https://coinatory.com/cryptocurrency-articles/price-of-bitcoin-what-influence-btc-price-7304/::Coinatory::article::Price of Bitcoin: 6 main factors influence the BTC price::Discover the key factors that impact the price of Bitcoin. Learn about the various economic, political, and technological factors that can affect it.::Bitcoin (BTC) is a cryptocurrency that Satoshi Nakamoto, its unidentified creator, created in 2009. A blockchain keeps track of all transactions, displaying each unit’s transaction history and demonstrating ownership. Bitcoin is not backed by a government or issued by a central bank like conventional currencies are. Because Bitcoin is not a corporation, investing in it differs from investing in stocks or bonds. As a result, there are no corporate balance sheets, Form 10-Ks, fund results, or other conventional tools for selecting an investment to analyze. Learn about the factors that influence the price of bitcoin to justify better your decision to invest in it. The monetary policy instruments, inflation rates, and economic growth measurements that generally affect the value of a currency do not apply to Bitcoin because it is neither issued by a central bank nor backed by a government. Bitcoin acts as more of a commodity being used to store value, so the following factors influence its price: The supply of an asset is a key factor in setting its price. An asset in high demand is more likely to have high pricing than one in a large supply, which will have low prices. Since there will only be 21 million manufactured and only a certain number made year, the supply of Bitcoin is typically well publicized. Its protocol only permits the creation of new Bitcoin at a fixed rate, which is intended to decrease over time. Bitcoin’s future supply is, therefore, dwindling, which adds to demand. This is similar to a reduction in corn supply if harvests were to be reduced every four years until no more was harvested, and it was publicly advertised that this would happen—corn prices would skyrocket. Both regular people and big investors are starting to like bitcoin more because it’s getting a lot of attention in the news, from people who give investment advice, and from business owners who say bitcoin is valuable now and will be in the future. Countries like Venezuela, where money is losing its value fast, also like bitcoin a lot. People who need to move large amounts of money secretly or for illegal reasons also prefer it. This means that more people want bitcoin, but there won’t be as much available in the future, which has made its price go up. However, the price of bitcoin still goes up and down a lot. For example, in 2017, its price went up a lot, then it fell and stayed low for a while, and then in 2021, it quickly went up and down again. Similar to other commodities, production costs are a major factor in setting the price of bitcoin. Research suggests that the price of bitcoin in cryptocurrency marketplaces is closely correlated with its marginal cost of production. The production cost for Bitcoin is essentially the sum of the direct fixed expenses for the infrastructure and electricity needed to mine the cryptocurrency and an indirect cost associated with the algorithm’s degree of difficulty. A network of miners competes to decipher an encrypted number in order to mine bitcoins. The first miner to accomplish so receives a reward of newly created bitcoins as well as any transaction fees earned since the last block was located. It takes a lot of processing power to use brute force to solve the hash in order to unlock a block and receive a reward. The miner will have to spend a lot of money on numerous pricey mining equipment. Also, the bitcoin mining process uses a lot of electricity. According to estimates, the bitcoin mining network consumes more electricity than certain small nations. Despite the fact that Bitcoin is the most well-known cryptocurrency, there are hundreds of other tokens competing for capital. By 2022, Bitcoin will control the majority of cryptocurrency marketplaces. But with time, its power has diminished. Almost 80% of the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies in 2017 was made up of Bitcoin. The proportion fell to less than 50% by 2022. The fundamental cause of this was growing acceptance of alternative currency and their potential. For instance, due to a rise in decentralized finance, Ethereum has become a fierce rival to Bitcoin (DeFi). Ether (ETH), the cryptocurrency that serves as “gas” for transactions on its network, has attracted investment from investors who see its potential for redesigning the rails of contemporary financial infrastructure. The popularity of other cryptocurrencies has increased as they are continually being introduced. Other coins like Tether, Ethereum, BNB, USDCoin, and Solana are reducing the market share of Bitcoin. Competition has drawn investors to Bitcoin even as they have taken some of their dollars from the ecosystem. As a result, there is now more demand for and knowledge about cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has profited from the attention as a type of standard-bearer for the cryptocurrency ecosystem, and its prices have stayed high. Bitcoin came out after a financial crisis caused by weak rules in the trading of complex financial products. The world of cryptocurrencies is known for not having many rules and being open across countries because it’s not regulated yet. The fact that Bitcoin doesn’t have strict rules has its good and bad sides. It can be used anywhere in the world without the usual government restrictions. However, governments and other groups are still trying to figure out how to regulate cryptocurrencies. There’s a chance that new rules are coming, but it’s not clear how they will affect Bitcoin’s price. For example, decisions by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) can influence Bitcoin’s value. When the SEC approved the first U.S. bitcoin-related ETF, Bitcoin’s price shot up to $69,000 in October 2021. But a few months later, its price dropped to around $40,000. China’s ban on Bitcoin trading and mining in September 2021 also affected Bitcoin. It led to a decrease in its supply and demand. Prices fell from about $51,000 at the beginning of September to around $41,000 by the end of the month. However, prices went back up as the mining operations moved to more crypto-friendly countries and got back to business. News about Bitcoin can make its price go up or down, as it tries to keep investors and others interested. When anything changes with things that affect Bitcoin’s price, the news spreads fast. So, good news usually makes Bitcoin’s price go up, and bad news can make it go down. One big thing that changes cryptocurrency prices is how investors feel about it. This feeling is shaped by how much Bitcoin is available, how much people want it, how much it costs to make it, what other cryptocurrencies are doing, new rules, and what the news says about all of this.

Share this article Renowned art auction house Sotheby’s is making history by hosting the first public sale of works from a Bitcoin Ordinals collection. The inaugural series titled “BitcoinShrooms” was created by pseudonymous digital artist Shroomtoshi. Bitcoin Ordinals are the NFTs of the Bitcoin blockchain, taking advantage of its decentralized, censorship-resistant design and infrastructure. While similar to Ethereum NFTs in some ways, Bitcoin Ordinals benefit from Bitcoin’s decentralization and user sovereignty over its assets. We're thrilled to present our inaugural Bitcoin Ordinals sale, featuring @BitcoinShrooms 🍄 pic.twitter.com/UkX5jsfKLh — Sotheby's Metaverse (@Sothebysverse) December 6, 2023 Ordinals represent a proof of concept within the Bitcoin network and are often referred to as “digital artifacts” rather than NFTs which are, by design, non-fungible. The process involves inscribing satoshis, the smallest units of Bitcoin, with digital content or machine-readable language, reflecting Bitcoin’s immutable nature. This approach contrasts with traditional NFTs, especially regarding the lack of required royalty payments for sales. Consequently, Bitcoin Ordinals represent a significant deviation from conventional NFTs, often sparking debate within various Bitcoin communities. “Digital artifacts are permissionless. An NFT which cannot be sold without paying a royalty is not permissionless, and thus not a digital artifact,” the project’s documentation explains. The Bitcoin Ordinals project was begun by blockchain developer Casey Rodarmor, who hinged on the permissionless design of the Bitcoin blockchain as an initial concept to create digital artifacts. The online auction, open now through December 13, marks the public debut of these unique and probably rare pixel art pieces that offer a whimsical yet educational guided tour of Bitcoin’s cultural and technical revolution. The BitcoinShrooms collection’s standout pieces decode complex Bitcoin concepts like private key derivation and mining incentives through retro-themed pixel art mushrooms and clever cultural Easter eggs. Estimates for top works range between $20,000 to $30,000. “The BitcoinShrooms collection is a pixelated recap of the first 13 years of Bitcoin, a homage to the 8-bit style of art that expresses a slight nostalgia for the 90s, a way to soil 10s of thousands of SSDs spread across the world with my art (->next level cyber-vandalism,” said Shroomtoshi. The BitcoinShrooms sale enters a heated climate around the purpose and evolution of Bitcoin. Miners have prioritized maximizing transaction fee revenue lately, making them unlikely to restrict ordinal inscriptions despite complaints. On the other hand, Bitcoin developer Luke Dashjr sparked renewed debate by publicly decrying ordinals and other inscription projects as “spam attacks” on the Bitcoin network. Notably, Bitcoin has recently surpassed Ethereum in terms of average transaction fees. This change highlights the growing interest and activity in the Bitcoin network, especially in the context of how Ordinals and other blockchain innovations have emerged of late.

526::https://theconversation.com/how-blockchain-will-transform-our-cities-69561::The Conversation::article::How blockchain will transform our cities::If you think the internet has changed your life, brace yourself for the next digital innovation that’s set to transform our world.::Many trends on the horizon offer opportunities that could transform our cities. From self-driving vehicles and the sharing economy through to cloud computing and blockchain technologies, each of these trends is quite significant on its own. But the convergence of their disruptive forces is what will create real value and drive innovations. Take blockchain and the sharing economy as an example. Bringing these two forces together can potentially disrupt established companies like Uber and Airbnb. The success of these companies is largely due to their ability to make use of existing assets people owned, that had been paid for, but from which new value could be derived. Effectively, these companies set up digital platforms that harnessed “excess capacity” and relied on other people to deliver the services. The same applies to other so-called “sharing economy” companies that merely act as service aggregators and collect a cut off the top. In the process, they gather valuable data for further commercial gain. But can this business model be challenged and enhanced for the benefit of those who are delivering the service and creating the real value? Can technology be used to bypass the third party and allow direct peer-to-peer collaboration within a distributed governance structure? What could a “peer-owned” and “peer-run” marketplace look like? Blockchain technology could just be the answer. You can think of blockchain as the second generation of the internet – a transformation from an internet of information to an internet of value. Blockchain allows suppliers and consumers – even competitors – to share a decentralised digital ledger across a network of computers without the need for a central authority. The assets that can be described on the blockchain can be financial, legal, physical or electronic. No single party has the power to tamper with the records – sophisticated algorithms keep everyone honest by ensuring data integrity and authentication of transactions. But the impacts of blockchain go well beyond financial services and transactions. Its real value is in establishing trust-based interactions and accelerating the transfer of governance from centralised institutions to distributed networks of peer-to-peer collaboration. The impact can be profound: a centralised institution acting as intermediatory in a transaction of value is now at risk of being disrupted because the same service can be provided on the blockchain through peer-to-peer interaction. Blockchain gives service providers a means to collaborate and derive a greater share of the value for themselves. Smart agents on a blockchain could do just about everything provided by a service aggregator. The technology’s trust protocol allows autonomous associations to be formed and controlled by the same people who are creating the value. All revenues for services, minus overheads, would go to members, who also control the platform and make decisions. Trust is not established by third parties, but rather through an encrypted consensus enabled by smart coding. We already have examples of this technology in action. Arcade City, a global community of peer-to-peer services, is planning to offer a ride-sharing service on the blockchain. To catch a ride, the user buys digital currency (known as tokens), creates an offer and commits funds for the ride. A driver claims the offer, matches the funds to signal their commitment to provide the service, and picks up the passenger. The blockchain releases the funds as soon as the user acknowledges completing the ride. Arcade City has a city council, which will overlook the system for three years until it is fully decentralised and up and running. The same concept of using distributed public record technology can be applied to a wide range of urban applications. For example, an energy startup in Perth is looking to trial a peer-to-peer technology solution that would allow consumers to offer excess energy, available through their solar panels, on the blockchain. Clever code matches the suppliers with consumers without the need to go through the energy provider. The blockchain technology and ecosystem around it are evolving rapidly, and are probably raising more questions than answers. How do we establish a system of transparent governance to ensure the longevity of the blockchain? What about security, speed, cost and, more importantly, regulations? As with other disruptive technologies, there will be winners and losers. If the technology is successfully managed for scalable growth, it could very well disrupt established norms and transform our societies. Large layers of data generated by consumers today, which are controlled by hubs, can become public. In a world driven by blockchain, consumers can monetise their own data to derive greater value. By knowing when and how to take advantage of this technology, we have an opportunity to transform the digital platforms for tomorrow’s cities. The blockchain becomes the city’s operating system, invisible yet ubiquitous, improving citizens’ access to services, goods and economic opportunities. Today, the technology is yet to mature. It remains to be seen if the expectations can live up to reality. But, in many ways, this is quite reminiscent of the internet in the mid-1990s. Not many people would have predicted its significance back then. Had we understood the impacts of the internet 20 years ago, what could we have done differently to create more value? That is where we stand today with blockchain. The power of this transformation will become more compelling as the hype settles down and we begin to unleash the possibilities.::2016-12-13T19:04:57Z::Blockchain, Cities, Cities & Policy, Digital disruption, Internet, Sharing economy, disruptive technology::Hussein Dia::Home::https://images.theconversation.com/files/148571/original/image-20161205-19414-106q94z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C160%2C4274%2C2079&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
527::https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/04/30/its-modding-but-on-steroids-mark-long-on-the-future-of-web3-gaming/::CoinDesk::article::‘It's Modding, But on Steroids’: Mark Long on the Future of Web3 Gaming::Shrapnel, a blockchain-infused first-person shooter game, is expected to be released in 2025. Its creator gives a preview to Jeff Wilser ahead of his appearance at Consensus 2024.::Web3 games have a shaky track record. It’s easy to see the appeal: There are literally billions of people playing games, and most of them do it for free. They spend countless hours — and often their own cash — to create content that grows the ecosystem, and they get nothing while the gaming companies get everything. Web3 games, in theory, give power (and equity) to the players. Or, that was the pitch in the last bull cycle, when Web3 games like Axie Infinity seemed to create new economies and even lift players from poverty. Then prices tumbled, games crumbled. Can Web3 games make a comeback? Mark Long is a speaker at Consensus 2024, in Austin, Texas, May 29-31. Now at least one thing is different: Top-tier gaming talent has entered the Web3 space, focused on creating games that are actually a blast to play, not just a means to grind out crypto. “It’s very important that it’s a great game, period, whether for Web2 or Web3,” says Mark Long, CEO of Shrapnel, the blockchain-infused and “moddable” first-person shooter game, which is expected to be released in 2025. (Modding refers to the ability of gamers to modify aspects of the game experience.) Long knows about building great games. He’s the former head of Xcloud, a game-streaming service, at Microsoft, the former head of publishing at HBO Interactive, and he’s produced over 32 games in his 26-year career. And now he’s bringing that savvy to Web3. Long opens up about the extra challenges in creating a Web3 game (the wrong tweak to a database can cost players millions), what gamers can expect from Shrapnel (“modding on steroids”), and why he views Consensus as the most “scholarly” crypto conference. Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity. What’s the vision of Shrapnel? What are you trying to pull off? Mark Long: So, I love triple-A shooters. I just love all shooters; I play all of them all the time. But what I love more is actually modding shooters. And I mean, going all the way back to Doom 2 and Quake and Half-Life. You're speaking my language. I still remember the keyboard shortcut to pull up the shotgun in Doom. Yes! So even though I was making games in the studio during the day, at night I would come home and mod those type of games. And if I got 11 people to play my map, I'd be thrilled. Right? Which is ridiculous because I'm making games for millions of players. But this is something very personal. I get a personal joy from modding a game that I really like. So, fast forward to the Roblox, Minecraft, Fortnite era. Kids start off making their own content in Minecraft, and they age into Roblox, and so they become more proficient. And with Fortnite, 50% of the engagement is made by other players, which is stunning. But when you turn 18 to 35 years old, there's nothing for you to age into. And I don't think young players are going to stop wanting to make their own games. And our theory is if you gave them the same professional level of tools that we have, they'd actually make some pretty cool shit. So, that's what Shrapnel is. It's an extraction first-person shooter based on Web3. And it’s a free, frictionless database technology that allows us to seamlessly attribute all these contributions that players can make to a game, and then reward them for it. How so? You’ll be rewarded for your contribution. And in our world, that can be a lot of things. You can modify our maps — just use all our static meshes and modify them. You can do character skins. You can do character customization. Make emblems, customize weapons. And then, of course, you just mint those. And then I could sell, trade, rent, stake all those items. That's what I'm really excited about. It's modding, but on steroids. Let’s talk about Web3 gaming more broadly. Taking Shrapnel out of the equation, why do you think there haven’t yet been any great Web3 games? So, all these games were put into production in the last bull cycle, right? And they’re just now coming to the public in early access or open beta. But I'd argue there are a handful of really good games out there that I'm excited to play. There’s MetalCore, the mech shooter. There's Wildcard, the card-battler game by the husband and wife team that did Words with Friends. I like Dead Drop. I like Off the Grid, which has art direction by Neill Blomkamp. I fucking love Neill Blomkamp. So the short version is there are a handful of games that actually are going to be really good and break through, and then of course there’s Shrapnel. Fair enough! There are some good games. But those seem to be the outliers. I think part of your lament for the earlier Web3 games is because of two reasons: A lot of the teams are not game development teams, they're crypto development teams. Right? And two, it’s production values. They haven’t had the money to put into the game to make it really great. What’s extra challenging about building a Web3 game, compared to a traditional video game? What are the additional wrinkles caused by decentralization? Great question. I want to start by saying that it’s very important that it’s a great game, period, whether for Web2 or Web3. It’s easy to lose track of that. But to answer your question, one simple thing comes to mind. Think about working on a database in a game. Think about, for example, all the items I can collect for my character — my gear, my helmet, my weapon, all that stuff. You have a pretty complex database and it has to provide for all this attribution. If I make a mistake in normal development, you just reset the database and then start over again. But here with web3, that has real-world value. Right? So if we fuck up and I delete your $1,000 worth of stuff, I can't claim that I'm World of Warcraft and you never really owned it anyway. That’s a huge problem. So we have to be especially meticulous as we integrate any Web3 component. Then there’s the problem of potential exploits — things that we miss could create a disaster for the economy. It takes longer to integrate the Web3 component. The code has to be audited at a level that game code never normally needs to be audited. That was all brand new to us. It slows down our roadmap. But as we get better at it and there’s more tooling APIs and SDKs available, it will just get better and better. For many who are only casually following the Web3 gaming space, they’ve heard of the boom-and-bust cycle of “Play to Earn.” There are concerns that this model is not sustainable — it only works when the token price is rising, but then, if the price falls, the economy collapses. What’s the solve for this? What’s the trick for making Web3 games viable for the long-term, and not relying upon price appreciation? So I would probably guess that for the economies that you’re thinking about that collapsed, they’re kind of pyramid economies where you have to have a large number inflowing at the bottom, and they grind and level-up assets or characters that then get sold to the person above them who’s also grinding. You need lots coming in at the bottom to do that. And then when the community collapses or the token price collapses, nobody's playing because it's a fun game — they’re there to make money off it. So they abandon it. Ah, so the trick is the game quality itself… What we think will happen in game economies like Shrapnel is the more players you have, and the more engagement you have, the more they’re using the token in-game. That’s driving the need for the token and it kind of has a burn effect. It’s consuming the supply, and that means there's more buy pressure than sell pressure. If I hear you right, it sounds like you’re saying there needs to be actual legit utility in these tokens. It’s not sham utility. People are using it. They're using it because they want to play the game and have fun. So the game needs to be good, period. Am I getting that right? Yeah. Let's just use a rough order of magnitude example. The average paying player in Web3 might be $100 a month versus $10 a month on Web2. So every one of those new Web3 players adds $100 of consumption. Remember, the economy is in the token, so they are spending $100 of the token. Okay, last couple of questions are about Consensus itself. What’s your favorite Consensus memory? Well, you know, last year we demoed the game for the first time at Consensus. We were right at one of the main entrances, and by the end of the first day, they had just moved the bar to our space because so many people wanted to play the game, and were excited to get their hands on it. What are you most looking forward to at Consensus this year? It’s a really well-curated conference. I would call it a scholarly conference, where the panels are well-vetted. Love it, and thank you. On a less scholarly front, what’s the best Consensus side-party? It'll be ours. Good answer. See you there! Edited by Benjamin Schiller.

Super Sushi Samurai (SSS), a newly launched altcoin, has suffered a significant security breach. As of the latest update, SSS’s market value has dropped to $0.000000000002239, marking a devastating 99% decrease. Likewise, its 24-hour trading volume spiraled down to $9,570.9. The breach was first detected and announced by Certik, a leading security firm specializing in blockchain technology. According to Certik, the Super Sushi Samurai token experienced a critical incident on the Blast platform. It led to a substantial loss of approximately $4.6 million. Despite the alarming nature of the breach, Certik clarified that the incident involved a white hat rescue operation. The firm suggested that the actions taken were aimed at preventing further damage rather than exploiting the system for malicious gain. The Super Sushi Samurai team quickly responded to the crisis by halting all token transfers and launching a thorough investigation into the exploit, which was identified as related to the minting process. “Pausing token transfers and investigating. We have been exploited, it’s mint related. We are still looking into the code,” the team disclosed.

529::https://blockworks.co/news/near-foundation-chain-signatures::Blockworks::article::NEAR launches tool for signing transactions on Bitcoin, Ethereum and more::NEAR Foundation has launched “Chain Signatures,” enabling users to sign transactions on supported blockchains from a single NEAR account.::At launch, Chain Signatures will be compatible with Bitcoin, Ethereum and Cosmos network chains, as well as DogeCoin and XRP Ledger NEAR Foundation and Adobe Stock modified by Blockworks Swiss non-profit organization NEAR Foundation has launched “Chain Signatures,” enabling users to sign transactions on supported blockchains from a single NEAR account. Chain Signatures enables accounts and smart contracts on NEAR to sign transactions for different chains. At launch, this will include Bitcoin, Ethereum and Cosmos network chains, as well as DogeCoin and XRP Ledger. It will soon support Solana, TON Network and Polkadot, according to the team. By enabling Chain signatures, DeFi protocols can utilize assets from other chains without requiring a cross-chain bridge. This is possible because Chain Signatures are designed to be account-based rather than bridge-based. Read more: NEAR Foundation applies for .near top-level domain According to Kendall Cole, director of research and development company Proximity Labs — which supports projects on NEAR and Aurora — Chain Signatures can potentially unlock new use cases for DeFi protocols. “Users can use XRP as collateral to borrow USDC, or trade DOGE for SOL. This is particularly innovative for non-smart-contract chains like Bitcoin, DogeCoin and Ripple because none of the major bridges support these chains today,” Cole said. NEAR protocol documents show that Chain Signatures link NEAR account addresses to other blockchains using an Additive Key Derivation. This mechanism enables the single master key to be derived into multiple subkeys. When a user wants to transact between different blockchains, a deployed multichain smart contract will make a signature request for the transaction on the target blockchain network, and a Multi-Party Computation (MPC) service will sign the transaction. Read more: MPC wallets have a trade-off. Is it worth it? Once the signature is obtained, the smart contract will return it to the user, allowing the user to send the signed transaction to execute it on the target blockchain. “Smart contracts on NEAR will be able to custody assets on any chain (since they can sign transactions on any chain via chain signatures), and maintain user balances similar to how single chain lending protocols or DEXs do now,” Cole explained. The Chain Signatures MPC network will be launched in partnership with EigenLayer, which will secure the network using its restaked ETH. At launch, there will be ten node providers, including a handful of Actively Validated Services (AVS) infrastructure providers. “Post-launch, EigenLayer will be used to provide economic security to the network and transition the MPC network to a permissionless version. To participate in the MPC network, prospective node operators will need to re-stake their ETH and will be penalized if they maliciously authorize any transactions that did not originate from a NEAR account,” Cole explained.

530::https://coinatory.com/cryptocurrency-articles/the-secret-of-arbitrage-trading-7095/::Coinatory::article::Increase your profits with arbitrage trading - check out these examples!::Are you ready to take your cryptocurrency trading to the next level? Don't miss this essential guide to arbitrage trading.::Arbitrage trading is the simultaneous purchase and sale of a single asset or a group of related assets in various markets with the goal of making a profit from minute variations in the asset’s quoted price. It takes advantage of brief fluctuations in the cost of identical or comparable financial products on various markets or in various forms. Arbitrage exists as a result of market inefficiencies, and it both exploits those inefficiencies and resolves them. Any time a stock, commodity, or piece of currency can be bought at one price on one market and simultaneously sold at a higher price on another, arbitrage can be used. The circumstance offers the trader the chance to profit without taking any risks. Arbitrage offers a way to make sure that prices don’t diverge significantly from fair value over an extended period of time. With advancements in technology, it has become extremely difficult to profit from pricing errors in the market. A lot of traders have automated trading programs configured to track changes in similar financial instruments. Any ineffective pricing structures are typically addressed quickly, often within a few seconds, and the opportunity is lost. As a simple illustration of arbitrage, think of the following: on cryptocurrency exchange A, token X is currently trading at $20; on cryptocurrency exchange B, it is currently trading at $20.05. A trader can buy token X on cryptocurrency exchange A and immediately sell the same token X on cryptocurrency exchange B to make a profit of 5 cents per coin. The trader can continue to use this arbitrage until cryptocurrency exchange A runs out of this token or until exchange A or exchange B specialists adjust their prices to eliminate the opportunity. A trickier example can be found in currencies markets using triangular arbitrage. In this case, the trader converts one currency to another, converts that second currency to a third bank, and finally converts the third currency back to the original currency. Assume you are given the following exchange rates for your $1 million: USD/EUR = 1.1586, EUR/GBP = 1.4600, and USD/GBP = 1.6939. There is a chance to make money by arbitraging these exchange rates: From these transactions, you would receive an arbitrage profit of $1,384 Trading called “arbitrage” takes advantage of the minute price differences between identical or similar assets in two or more markets. The arbitrage trader buys the asset in one market and sells it in the other market at the same time to pocket the difference between the two prices. The following is a list of some of the most common questions we get asked about our services. Arbitrage traders, or arbitrageurs, typically work for major financial institutions. It typically entails trading a sizeable sum of money, and the split-second opportunities it presents can only be recognized and taken advantage of with extremely sophisticated software. The practice of buying and selling shares of stocks, commodities, cryptocurrencies, or currencies on various markets in order to take advantage of the inevitable fluctuations in their prices from minute to minute is known as arbitrage. However, the term “arbitrage” is also sometimes used to describe other trading activities. One tactic that is well-liked among hedge fund investors is merger arbitrage, which entails purchasing shares of companies prior to a merger that has been announced or is anticipated. Arbitrage traders improve the efficiency of financial markets by working to increase their profits. As they buy and sell, the price difference between identical or similar assets narrows. Assets with a lower price are sold, while assets with a higher price are not sold. In this way, arbitrage eliminates market pricing inefficiencies and increases market liquidity.

Share this article Pudgy Penguins, one of the most popular NFT collections, announced today that its new line of Pudgy Toys will now be sold in 2,000 Walmart stores across the US. Each toy comes with a unique code that unlocks access to Pudgy World, a multiplayer game built on zkSync Era’s layer-2 blockchain where players can customize their penguin avatar. The game aims to blend real-world and digital play. The partnership represents a major retail milestone for Pudgy Penguins, a company born out of the recent boom in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and blockchain technology. Since launching in 2021, the company has seen over $400 million in sales of its digital collectibles. “Pudgy Penguins is at the forefront of transforming the toy industry, merging unique digital experiences with blockchain technology,” said Pudgy Penguins CEO Luca Netz in a statement. The company says its toys leverage both social media and blockchain technology to create an innovative brand experience. The NFT holders who own the digital art that the toy designs are based on will receive royalties from toy sales. For Walmart, carrying the line helps the retail giant tap into new digital toy trends. “Pudgy Penguins is bridging the gap between our physical and digital worlds of play for kids in a really engaging way,” said Brittany Smith, Walmart’s vice president of toys.

A financier and supply chain expert discuss::Academics from different disciplines come Head to Head in this series to tackle topical debates.::This is an article from Head to Head, a series in which academics from different disciplines chew over current debates. Let us know what else you’d like covered – all questions are welcome. Details of how to contact us are at the end of the article. Arturo Bris: Have you ever watched footage from the early 1980s of people trying to explain the internet? They’re sceptical and confused and have no idea how to say “@”, which is comical given what we now take for granted. But that’s where we are with blockchain now. People don’t believe in it because they don’t understand it. Blockchain is a technology with two ingredients: the first is a distributed ledger, meaning a database with identical copies held by everyone in a network. There is no intermediary, no central data depository. The second is a consensus algorithm (and this is the true innovation in the technology): the ability to digitally agree on any change in the data. It is the set of decision rules by which any new entry in the database is accepted and then shared by everyone. The consensus algorithm will be different for every blockchain – some work on a simple majority rule, some (such as Bitcoin) have a subset of members paid to fulfil that role, and others have much more complicated arrangements. The structure of the database is also particular, because it is structure as a sequence of entries (a ledger), not a deposit. If you don’t understand blockchain, get educated, because it’s an amazing new technology that’s going to revolutionise the world. It’s going to monetise and unlock value that today is hidden. The social impact is going to be massive. It’s going to permit new avenues for human interaction that didn’t exist before. Carlos Cordon: I’m not sure about that, Arturo. I, for instance, understand what blockchain is, but I don’t believe that it’s going to have the impact you describe. Blockchain requires having a lot of copies of the same data. This means that you are required to multiply the data storage by, let’s say, 100 times. The same data is stored in 100 places. That might work for something as standard and simple as money: Bitcoin works, for example, because there is just one Bitcoin, not thousands of different products. But if you think about supply chains, for example, you’re talking about thousands of products. For each product, a lot of information is required, like weight, format, expiry date, composition, etc. This means that blockchain is extremely impractical for many of the applications that its evangelists are proposing. Amazon isn’t using blockchain. Google isn’t. In fact, none of the top digital giants are, although Amazon has said it’s happy to provide cloud storage for it. The Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Krugman has said that Bitcoin will “set the monetary system back 300 years”. AB: Krugman also said in 2011 that the Euro would soon disappear, and look where we are today. And, with respect to Google and Amazon, that’s exactly what disruptive technologies are: they are not usually adopted by the established players, because they disrupt their own – established – business models. And by the way, more and more companies are using blockchain for applications beyond cryptocurrencies. These include music streaming, social networking, commodities trading, property registries – the list goes on. Blockchain is a technology that guarantees full security (it cannot be hacked) because data are already shared by the members of the network, so there is nothing to hack. We are already seeing the transformation moving extremely fast, and that’s why you need to embrace it. CC: The way blockchain works makes it secure and trustworthy, that much is true. But if we introduce blockchain into supply chains, for example, we’re firstly trying to solve a problem that isn’t there – and, secondly, we’re possibly creating further problems for ourselves. This is because trust in supply chains generally isn’t an issue. Let’s imagine I’m Unilever or Procter & Gamble. Am I going to try to cheat Walmart or Carrefour? No. We have a certain level of trust. We may disagree, but we don’t cheat. But with blockchain comes complete transparency. And we don’t want that. Not because we don’t trust the other partner, but because we use information to negotiate. Besides, in supply chains we’ve been working on sharing information and data for years. We don’t need new data technologies. It’s already complicated enough. AB: I have no problem with that. If trust does not need to be formalised, there is no need for blockchain. I don’t think we will use blockchain to manufacture cookware or to design new means of transportation either. But what makes blockchain revolutionary is the transformation of physical assets into digital ones. This is known as tokenization. Cryptocurrencies, for example, are the tokenization of money, but that is only one example. You can tokenize stocks and financial assets, property, music, services – the list goes on. By replicating assets with a digital token, we can facilitate transactions without physical delivery. CC: Then there’s the challenge of a potential mismatch between the virtual value chain and the physical value chain. You can tokenize assets, but what happens if someone changes the physical product? Blockchain couldn’t have prevented the UK horsemeat scandal, for example, where horsemeat was found in products that supposedly contained only beef. Meanwhile, the need for storage is going to multiply by an order of magnitude as copies of all these ledgers are held by each individual in a blockchain. And the only people who are going to benefit from that are companies like Amazon, selling cloud storage. AB: This is a fallacy. In fact, the structure of a blockchain allows us to store the whole database by storing just a small part of it. I know this is difficult to understand. In fact what happens is that, through encryption, we will be able to drastically reduce the size of the entries. Second, because of the sequential nature of the database, and since all entries are linked both to the previous and the next one, we will need to store just the last block(s) of the database. Overall, I think that we need to think beyond the storage of data and contracts as the main uses of blockchain. Tokenization will transform our transactions. Besides, the lack of need for intermediaries will also transform organisations. We can develop a new type of organisation that is democratic, not in the sense that it doesn’t need a CEO but in the sense of a decentralised autonomous organisation that is super efficient. This is going to be the future. By monetising assets that we currently do not monetise – such as our social capital, our fitness data, our attention to advertisers – we will add value. And that is only possible through a technology so new and complex that we’re still struggling to explain to each other how it works. CC: OK. But so far, I have seen no evidence of blockchain being used for truly revolutionary purposes. Walmart is using it to track vegetables. I saw a headline recently: “IBM joins efforts to create the blockchain equivalent of Yellow Pages” – Yellow Pages died 20 years ago, why are they trying to resuscitate that concept? Blockchain is certainly one of the top strategic tech trends at the moment but from looking at what companies are actually doing with it, I don’t think it’s going to change the world.

But will the hype match reality? A metaverse NEOM Legislation::The Middle East has been making strides in Web3. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) established digital assets regulators such as the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) in Dubai and the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) in Abu Dhabi. Last year, ADGM-based Hub71 launched a $2 billion initiative to support Web3 startups in the region. Thanks to its favorable stance towards cryptocurrency, innovation, and tax incentives, the UAE has become a hotspot for crypto and blockchain projects and funds. And now Saudi Arabia, its rival, is ambitious to prove it can become its own Web3 hub. U.K.-based Outlier Ventures recently announced it is launching its own Web3 accelerator program in partnership with Saudi’s National Technology Development Program (NPDP). "The level of dedication, education, and international experience of the highly skilled workforce, as well as the people coming to the Kingdom, is very interesting to see," said Outlier Ventures CEO Stephan Apel. “While the Web3 ecosystem in the Kingdom is still developing, we observe an extraordinarily fast rate of development and a huge potential,” Apel told CoinDesk. Saudi Arabia’s $95 billion Public Investment Fund (PIF) has reportedly held partnership talks with Andreessen Horowitz (A16z), one the leading VC backers of Web3 startups. Animoca Brands, a leading Asian Web3 gaming VC, has partnered with King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST) in the capital, Riyadh to advance the gaming ecosystem in the country. Speaking at The Outer Edge Summit, held at The Garage, a 28,000 meter squared startup district in KACST, Robby Yung, CEO of Amonica Brands lauded opportunities in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East. “We are coming here a little bit late, we recognized the opportunity here a decade ago but didn’t have the resources to tackle a new market at that time,” he said. “Here’s a really big piece of the world map… Since 2020, the UAE has become a gathering place for Web3 as a community because of the regulatory framework. Here, you have a huge country and over 60% of them are under the age of 30. Those are gamers, those are our people. So, we want to be on the ground, we want to understand how we can communicate with them. We felt it was important to start here as a point of contact,” Yung told CoinDesk during Animoca’s Outer Edge Summit in Riyadh. Meanwhile Golden Gate Ventures, a Singapore-based VC firm, has expanded its offices to the Gulf region and sees Saudi Arabia as the next frontier. “Overall, investment appetite in Saudi Arabia is very healthy, although we haven't seen Web3 as prominent as in other parts of the region. With the increased investment in artificial intelligence, we'll see more investments in Web3 follow swiftly,” Micheal Lints, a partner at Golden Gate, said. Saudi Arabia has advantages and disadvantages when it comes to attracting Web3 investment. It ranks in 62nd place in the World Bank’s “Ease of Doing Business” country index, outperforming for criteria like “setting up a business” (38th place overall) and “getting electricity” (18th). It does less well for “getting credit” (80th place) and “trading across borders” (86th). Its policies on women in the workplace, and alcohol, may make it unattractive to startups used to operating in less socially-restrictive environments. XVRS, the metaverse platform for NEOM, the $1.5 trillion desert city that was announced in 2017, is one of Saudi Arabia’s largest Web3-related projects to date. More than $1 billion has been invested in the creation of an immersive digital twin of NEOM, it has been reported. The space will offer immersive entertainment, a social platform, and a built-in digital marketplace for crypto and NFTs, the project backers say. During the Saudi Ministry of Investment Association’s inaugural Leap Summit, in February, the Hashgraph Association announced a five-year partnership to support local tech startups, including DeepTech, a $250 million venture studio. Leap Summit, Saudi Arabia's annual tech conference, attracted more than 220,000 attendees this year – nearly double that of Las Vegas’ Consumer Electronic Show (CES). While the Kingdom’s legal provisions for cryptocurrency are unclear, a report from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis reveals growing appetite for crypto among the Saudi population of 36 million. Saudi crypto investors amassed more than $350 million in crypto gains in 2023, overtaking the UAE, which recorded approximately $204 million in during the same period, the analysis shows. Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, is eyeing the country as a source of growth, according to Bandar Al Tunisi, Development Lead for Binance in Saudi Arabia. Binance is talking with regulators, including the SAMA central bank and the capital markets regulatory authority, along with the Ministry of Communications and Information, he said. Al Tunisi hopes for “high-level” regulation for digital currencies in the country as soon as this year. “I think it's one of the most important places in the world in terms of opportunity, in terms of growth, in terms of the willingness of the leadership, in terms of nimbleness of the leadership and the capability of the local population,” he said. “We are hopeful [the regulatory framework] will happen this year. Obviously that's not something that we have control over, but we're on the ground. We're ready.” Saudi Arabia's proactive approach to fostering innovation, coupled with strategic partnerships and its Vision 2030 initiative, positions the Kingdom as a significant contender in the global Web3 landscape. But time will tell if the current expectation, driven by government impetus, results in a sustainable Web3 industry. Correction (4/30/24/ 14:54 UTC): Bandar Al Tunisi is Binance's development lead.

This approach, while controversial, has shown to be effective for him in a market where timing and information are everything. The key to Fencer’s method lies in meticulous pre-analysis and constant monitoring of the market for new listings. By utilizing resources like DEX Screener, traders can identify trending narratives and potential catalysts that could drive the price of newly listed meme coins. “The longer the narrative in the Top Gainers, the stronger it becomes,” Fencer noted Read more: 7 Hot Meme Coins and Altcoins that are Trending in 2024 Moreover, Fencer shed light on the critical role of sniper bots in executing this strategy. These bots are designed to buy tokens as quickly as possible at launch. Therefore, they can significantly increase the chances of securing a token before its value skyrockets. Among the recommended tools are BONKbot for Solana on-chain trading, BananaGun for Ethereum and Solana, and Unibot, a popular choice for EVM and soon Solana. “To buy tokens as fast as possible, you need to use sniper bots. There isn’t a universal bot that works perfectly for every chain. Each bot has its own customization instructions. Mastering this skill isn’t easy, but the rewards that follow will more than compensate for your efforts,” Fencer added.

The volatile nature of meme coins and the potential for crypto scams underscore the importance of diligence and risk management. Investors are advised to verify the security of tokens through platforms like Rug Check and Coin Scan. Traders must also be prepared for the possibility that not every investment will yield the anticipated returns. Despite the inherent risks, Fencer’s strategy offers a tantalizing glimpse into the potential rewards of cryptocurrency trading. By combining thorough research, strategic use of technology, and an understanding of market dynamics, traders can position themselves to capture significant gains.

535::https://blockworks.co/news/franklin-templeton-new-crypto-etf-offering::Blockworks::article::Franklin Templeton debuts new crypto SMA amid bitcoin ETF hype ::Franklin Templeton's new SMA is set to hold BTC and ETH and be available for wealth managers on Eaglebrook Advisors’ platform.::New separately managed account is set to hold BTC and ETH and be available for wealth managers on Eaglebrook Advisors’ platform BalkansCat/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks After debuting a bitcoin ETF and eyeing the launch of an ether-focused counterpart, Franklin Templeton also continues to build out another segment of crypto products. The fund giant, with more than $1 trillion in assets under management, has launched the Franklin Templeton Digital Asset Dynamic BTC/ETH separately managed account (SMA), the company said Tuesday. SMAs offer a nuanced approach to investing, allowing investors greater customization in terms of asset diversification and tax optimization strategies. In the crypto realm, SMAs offer investors exposure to a range of exposures that go beyond bitcoin — currently the only crypto asset that US ETFs can hold directly.

It is to be available for registered investment advisers (RIAs) and other US wealth managers on Eaglebrook Advisors’ SMA platform. Anchorage Digital is set to custody the assets. Franklin Templeton’s latest SMA comes after the firm introduced two such investment vehicles in 2022. Its Digital Assets Core SMA invests in 10 to 15 of the largest digital assets. The Franklin Templeton Digital Assets Core Capped SMA deploys a similar strategy, but caps its allocations to BTC and ETH at 25% of the portfolio each. Franklin Templeton launched its Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) alongside a slate of competitors on Jan. 11. The fund currently ranks ninth of the 10 US spot bitcoin funds — in terms of assets under management — with $312 million as of market close Monday. The spot bitcoin ETFs have so far notched total net inflows of roughly $11.3 billion. Industry watchers expect more wealth managers to make such funds available to clients in the coming months, catalyzing further growth in the segment. Aside from diversified exposure, SMAs allow for investors to engage in tax-loss harvesting — purposefully incurring capital losses to offset capital gains taxes — and allow clients to own the underlying assets directly in their name at a qualified custodian, executives have said. Read more: Eaglebrook CEO: Bitcoin ETF would send crypto SMAs ‘into hyperdrive’ “[Crypto ETFs] allow more people to dip their toes in…in an easier way, which will in turn drive demand for our solutions from advisers because of the extra value prop via strategies and assets they can’t access in the ETF wrapper,” Eaglebrook CEO Christopher King told Blockworks last year. While the Securities and Exchange Commission approved ether futures ETFs, investors in the US cannot access exposure to ether via an ETH that holds the asset directly, for example.

Here’s why many are bearish Franklin Templeton is one of several firms — along with BlackRock, Grayscale Investments, Ark Invest and others — with spot ether ETF proposals in front of the SEC. Potential future US ETFs holding crypto assets other than BTC and ETH are “a little bit out of sight,” Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan told Blockworks on a podcast in January. It would be “a big leap” to get to a solana ETF, for example, Hougan added — noting there is not yet a regulated futures market for SOL.
