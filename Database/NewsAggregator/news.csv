On the 19th of May, AMBCrypto observed that Ethereum’s [ETH] average transaction size had fallen to $2,767. This was a 54.13% decline from the metric when the month began. At that time, the average transaction size was $5,893, according to data from IntoTheBlock. For the uninitiated, the average transaction size checks in dollar terms the mean transaction value for an asset on a particular day.  Historically, spikes in this metric signal high user activity—Especially from large investors and institutions. But when it decreases, it implies an absence of institutional interaction. As such, the recent state of Ethereum implies a presence of more retail users. Apart from that, this indicator identifies potential tops and bottoms. From the value mentioned, it was obvious that ETH seemed closer to its bottom than the top. At press time, ETH’s price was $3,106, indicating that it had swung around the same range in the last 24 hours. Source: IntoTheBlock Going by the analysis above, the price of the cryptocurrency could be set to hit a higher value in the short term. However, other metrics need to be considered. As a result of this, AMBCrypto looked at the Ethereum Exchange Net Position Change. According to data obtained from Glassnode, the Exchange Net Position Change has been in the negative region for most of the last 30 days. This metric tracks the 30-day change of the supply held in exchange wallets. A positive value indicates that more coins are in exchanges. On the other hand, a negative value indicates increased withdrawals from exchanges. One thing we noticed was that the metric suddenly became positive on the 18th of May. As of this writing, the ETH net position change was 81,715. This increase could be a sign that Ethereum participants are taking profits off the 6.50% increase within the last week. If this number continues to increase, then ETH’s price might decrease below $3,000 before the potential rally happens. Source: Santiment However, if exchange withdrawals intensify once more, the price might begin a slow increase toward $3,500. In a highly bullish situation, an increase to $4,000 could be an option. On Friday, the 17th of May, AMBCrypto reported how options traders were expecting ETH’s price to hit $3,600 between May and the end of June. At press time, Glassnode data showed that the sentiment had not changed. This is because of the signals from the Put/Call Ratio (PCR). Is your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator If the PCR is over 0.70, it implies a bearish sentiment and there are more puts than calls. However, a reading below 0.50 implies otherwise. At press time, Ethereum’s Put/Call Ratio was 0.35, meaning that most traders expect the value of the cryptocurrency to increase in the coming weeks.  ::2024-05-19T12:00:42::N/A::Victor Olanrewaju::Ethereum::https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ethereum-news-and-price-size-1000x600.webp

Ethereum [ETH] caught investors off guard as its price gained bullish momentum on the 17th of May. While the token’s price moved up, it broke above a bullish pattern that could allow the king of altcoins to touch $4k in the coming days or weeks. CoinMarketCap’s data revealed that ETH investors enjoyed profits last week, as the token’s price had surged by more than 6%.  Things heated up in the last few hours as ETH’s value increased by over 2.6% over the last day. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $3,108.31 with a market capitalization of over $373 billion. The bullish price action had a positive impact on the token’s social metrics, as its Social Volume remained high last week. Its Weighted Sentiment also entered the positive zone, meaning the bullish sentiment around ETH became dominant in the market. Source: Santiment Thanks to the price uptick, ETH broke above a bullish pattern that hinted at a price rise towards $4k. World Of Charts, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet highlighting that ETH broke out of a falling wedge pattern. The pattern appeared on ETH’s chart during the beginning of March, and since then, ETH has consolidated inside it. The tweet mentioned that the breakout could result in a 50% price rise, in turn allowing Ethereum to reclaim $4k once again. AMBCrypto then analyzed ETH’s metrics to see whether they support the possibility of it touching $4k anytime soon. Our analysis of CryptoQuant’s data revealed that ETH’s net deposit on exchanges was low compared to the last seven days’ average, signifying less selling pressure. Source: CryptoQuant Another positive metric was the Coinbase premium, as it indicated that buying sentiment was dominant among U.S. investors. However, not everything looked bullish for the king of altcoins. AMBCrypto’s look at Glassnode’s data revealed that ETH’s Network To Value (NVT) ratio registered a sharp uptick. A rise in the metric suggests that an asset is overvalued, hinting at a price decline. Source: Glassnode Ethereum’s Money Flow Index (MFI) also indicated a possible price correction as the indicator registered a decline. Nonetheless, the MACD displayed a bullish crossover. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also supported the bulls as it went northward. Source: TradingView Read Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2024-25 To see what targets it might reach if its bull rally sustains, AMBCrypto analyzed Hyblock Capital’s data. We found that ETH’s liquidation would rise near the $3.2k zone. A successful breakout above that would allow it to reach $3.5k in the coming days before it targets $4k. However, if ETH’s price turns bearish, then its value might plummet to $2.85k.

Bitcoin [BTC] network fees have fallen to a record low as the Layer 1 (L1) transaction volume continues to decline. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), on-chain data provider IntoTheBlock noted that transaction fees on the Bitcoin network plunged to their lowest level in three months this week. Recording a weekly transaction fee totaling $12 million, the network saw a 45% decline from the previous week.  This week’s decline in the Bitcoin network’s fee is due to the decrease in its transaction volume. According to Santiment’s data, the aggregate amount of BTC across all transactions completed on the network fell steadily during the week. Between the 11th and the 17th of May, Bitcoin’s transaction volume plummeted by 5%. Source: Santiment The average fee paid per transaction dropped as the network saw a decline in demand. According to Messari, this decreased by 17% during the period under review. At press time, the average cost of executing a transaction on the Bitcoin network was $2.56. The miners on Bitcoin’s network are the primary victims of its low network fees. After the percentage of miner revenue derived from transaction fees rallied to a year-to-date high of 75% on the 20th of April, post-halving event, it has since declined significantly. Source: Messari As of this writing, only 4% of miner revenue is derived from the fees paid by Bitcoin’s users. This marked a 95% decline from the YTD high, per Messari’s data. Low revenue and BTC’s recent price troubles have forced some miners to sell their holdings. AMBCrypto assessed Bitcoin’s Miner Supply Ratio and found that it has fallen by 0.21% since the halving event. This metric measures miners’ BTC holdings relative to the coin’s total supply. When it declines this way, miners are selling a larger portion of their mined coins. This is often due to capitulation from high operational costs, the desire to take profit, or a lack of confidence in the coin’s price. Is your portfolio green?

::The memecoin sector has experienced remarkable growth since the beginning of the year.  The memecoin space has seen the highest growth across all crypto sectors. According to recent data provided by Artemis, the sector is up by 114% YTD. The popularity and growth of WIF, PEPE and DOGE has had a lot to do with the growth of the memecoin sector. Notably, this sector beat Centralized Exchange tokens, DePIN tokens, and even AI tokens. Source: Artemis However, things could take a turn for the worse for these memecoins in the future.  AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that the social volume for WIF and DOGE had declined significantly over the past month. A fall in popularity could mean a fall in price for these tokens. As other memecoins such as TRUMP and BODEN begin taking center stage on social media platforms, tokens such as WIF and DOGE risk losing market share. These memecoins would need to regain popularity on social networks to keep their price momentum positive. PEPE, on the other hand, did witness a spike in Social Volume over the past few days, which suggested that it had managed to stay relevant on social media platforms despite other entrants in the market. Source: Santiment In terms of sentiment, there was a similar pattern observed. The Weighted Sentiment for WIF and DOGE declined materially, indicating that criticisms of these tokens across social media platforms were on the rise. However, PEPE continued to show consistent growth in this department, indicating that the overall perspective around the memecoin was positive. Source: Santiment In terms of network growth, PEPE showed improvements as well over the last few days, indicating that new addresses were starting to show interest in the coin. DOGE saw a surge in velocity over the last few days, implying an uptick in the frequency of transactions, whereas WIF observed a similar uptick in terms of transaction volume.

Bitcoin’s [BTC] whale activity has cratered to its lowest level since the beginning of the year. This, as the crypto developed resistance and support levels around the $65,000-price level on the charts. In fact, data obtained from Santiment revealed that over the past week, only 60,193 BTC transactions exceeded $100,000, marking its lowest count since the final week of 2023. Also, the number of BTC whales that hold over 100 coins has dropped by 0.48% in the last two months – An update possibly signifying a steady uptick in profit-taking activity among this investor category.  Source: Santiment Since it rallied to an all-time high of $73,750, BTC’s price has fallen on the charts. In doing so, BTC hit a string of lower highs to form a descending triangle. Now, although it breached the upper trend line of this triangle in April when it reclaimed the $70,000-zone, the king coin’s price has traded within this triangle over the past three months. Source: BTC/USDT on TradingView This price decline might be why BTC whales have reduced the volume of their transactions over the past few weeks. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $65,696, sitting above the upper trend line of the triangle. When an asset’s price breaks above the top of a descending triangle, it is considered a bullish signal. This suggests a shift in buying power as the bulls step in to overcome the existing selling pressure. Confirming the shift in attitude towards BTC, its weighted sentiment returned a positive value of 0.99 too. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-25 The shift in trend might have been precipitated by the fact that despite BTC’s recent price troubles, daily traders continue to record profit on their investments. AMBCrypto assessed the daily ratio of BTC’s transaction volume in profit to loss using a 30-day moving average and found that it returned a value of 1.21. This means that for every BTC transaction that ended in a loss over the past month, 1.21 transactions returned profits.

::Short-term BTC holders have started accumulating at a massive level.  Bitcoin [BTC] witnessed a massive bump in price over the last few days, causing a surge in optimism amongst traders. But it wasn’t just traders that were showing optimism around BTC. In the last few days, the Short Term Holders (STH) supply saw a net increase of over 20,000 Bitcoin. U.S. ETFs accumulated 11,000 Bitcoin during the same period, even when considering outflows from the Hong Kong ETFs. This suggested significant demand from other sources, as reflected in the price movement.  This increased demand from STHs creates a positive feedback loop. As more people buy in, the price goes up, attracting even more buyers. This can accelerate price increases. However, it’s important to remember that STHs are typically more likely to sell quickly on price dips, potentially leading to higher volatility. So, while STH accumulation is a positive sign for Bitcoin’s short-term momentum, it could affect BTC’s long term growth. Source: glassnode Another indicator of the rising number of Short Term Holders would be the declining Long/Short ratio. A falling long/short ratio suggested that the number of long-term holders accumulating BTC were declining. These long-term holders are more likely to keep their holdings during violent price fluctuations, which could also impact BTC negatively in the long run. The MVRV ratio for BTC had surged in the last few days, indicating that a large number of addresses holding BTC had turned profitable. This could add selling pressure on BTC, as STHs may be incentivized to sell their holdings for profit. Source: Santiment Whale behavior would also play a great role in determining the price of BTC in the future. In the last few days, whales have been stagnant in terms of accumulation of BTC. They have not sold any of their holdings, but have shown no interest in accumulating BTC at this price level. Is your portfolio green?

It all depends on...::Bitcoin’s price can head in so many different directions as the year goes on. It all depends on…  Bitcoin recorded a notable hike recently, with gains of 4.9% seen over the past week. This uptick has contributed to a broader bullish trend across the cryptocurrency market. Analysts are now closely monitoring various indicators to predict what might lie ahead for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. One such analyst, Willy Woo, shared his insights on the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) Oscillator for Bitcoin, discussing its potential implications for future market movements. Woo’s analysis on the social media platform X delved into the VWAP, a technical indicator that averages the price of an asset while considering the volume of transactions at each price level. This approach gives more importance to price levels with higher trading volumes, providing a more balanced view of price movements.  For Bitcoin, Woo specifically examined the VWAP using on-chain volume, which benefits from the transparency of the blockchain to provide clear data to all observers. The focus of Woo’s study is the VWAP Oscillator, which measures the ratio between Bitcoin’s spot price and its VWAP, displaying this relationship in a form that oscillates around zero. Source: Willy Woo on X Recent trends revealed that the VWAP Oscillator has been in negative territory for the past few months, but is now on an upward trajectory. Should this continue, it could soon reach the neutral zone, signaling a potential shift in market dynamics. Historical data also seemed to indicate that when the VWAP Oscillator exits the negative zone and starts to climb, it often precedes a period of bullish momentum for Bitcoin. The price typically continues to surge until the oscillator peaks in positive territory and begins to decline. According to Woo, this pattern means that “there is still a lot of room to run before a reversal or consolidation occurs,” making it a challenging time for bearish investors in the market. Further supplementing these bullish observations, a CryptoQuant analyst also highlighted an increasing number of purchases from retail investors. According to the analyst, they have now bought roughly $135.7 million worth of Bitcoin over the past month alone. Source: CryptoQuant This buying spree aligns with a spike in Bitcoin’s daily active addresses, as shown by Santiment’s data. The number of daily active addresses surged from approximately 49,000 to over 66,000 in a single day, illustrating a significant hike in market activity. Source: Santiment From a technical analysis perspective too, Bitcoin’s chart on the 4-hour timeframe showed some promising signs. The appearance of a bullish abandoned baby pattern followed by a bullish engulfing candlestick that closes above its predecessor is a particularly positive bullish signal. Source: BTC/USDT, TradingView These technical patterns align with Woo’s prediction, indicating that Bitcoin might be gearing up for more gains. Notably, one of the catalysts behind BTC’s current bullishness is the release of the latest CPI data which was slightly lower than the expected 0.4%, as previously reported by AMBCrypto.  ::2024-05-18T04:00:32::N/A::Samuel Edyme::Bitcoin::https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/News-Articles-FI-Editors-2-1000x600.png

Funnily enough, however, AMBCrypto found that assertion to be untrue. We realized this after examining the metric in question. At press time, development activity on the network was flat. This has been the case since 24 April. However, DOGE has also been consistently consolidating between $0.13 and $0.16 during this very period. Development activity measures the rate at which engineers publicly improve a project’s network. Looking back, the metric jumped from 0.39 to 16.24 back in February.  At the time, DOGE’s price skyrocketed from $0.08 to $0.14 to correspond with the aforementioned uptick. Something similar transpired between October and November 2023 too, with both the price and development activity moving hand in hand on the charts. Source: Santiment Therefore, it might not be out of place to assume that a hike in the metric might offer a price hike too. Also, if development activity falls, so will Dogecoin’s price. Now, DOGE could face a hard time reproducing its performance in February and March. Still, it is important to assess other metrics too. This would tell if the prediction is valid or not. One indicator AMBCrypto looked at was the liquidation levels. This indicator shows estimated price levels where liquidation events might occur. A liquidation event occurs when a trader’s open position is forcefully closed. Most times, this happens because the trader can no longer meet the requirements of keeping the position open. At press time, we noticed that the only possible liquidation points between $0.15 and $0.16 were scanty. This lack of liquidity could put DOGE’s price at risk. This could be the case because Dogecoin’s price might not move to the upside as the zone is not magnetic. Hence, a possible move for DOGE could be a potential sideways movement. In a worst-case scenario, the price might drop to $0.12. Apart from this indicator, AMBCrypto looked at Dogecoin’s Cumulative Liquidation Levels Delta (CLLD) as well. Source: Hyblock Positive values of the CLLD indicate more long liquidations. On the other hand, Negative values suggest that there are more short liquidations. At press time, the CCLD was positive. From a price perspective, the reading indicates that Dogecoin might undergo a full retrace. If this remains the case, the $0.12 bearish prediction might be validated. In addition to the analysis above, AMBCrypto also evaluated active addresses. At the time of writing, DOGE’s 24-hour active addresses were 54,600. Three months ago, this same figure was over 250,000. Simply put, the decline was proof of decreasing network activity. Beyond that, the one-day circulation was 325.94 million as well. Source: Santiment Is your portfolio green? Check the Dogecoin Profit Calculator Concerning the price, this fall in activity could stop DOGE from exponential growth on the charts. However, if things change for the better, DOGE might make a move towards $0.12.  ::2024-05-18T01:00:32::N/A::Victor Olanrewaju::Dogecoin::https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/dogecoin-news-and-price-correlation-1000x600.webp

Bitcoin [BTC] surprised investors last week as its price rallied by double digits. The trend sparked excitement in the market as expectations of BTC reclaiming $70k increased. In fact, if the latest data is to be considered, this possibility doesn’t seem to be a long shot. CoinMarketCap’s data revealed that BTC’s price rallied by more than 10% in the last seven days, allowing it to sit above $67k.  At the time of writing, the king of cryptos was trading at $67,115.81 with a market capitalization of over $1.32 trillion. While BTC’s price action favored the bulls, Titan of Crypto, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet highlighting an interesting development. As per the tweet, BTC was targeting the upper line of its realized price. If this translates into reality, then investors might witness BTC run above $100k in the coming weeks. The possibility of that happening was likely, as similar episodes happened in the past. To be precise, Bitcoin has touched the upper line of its realized price during each and every cycle in the past. Things in terms of on-chain metrics also looked pretty optimistic for Bitcoin. AMBCrypto’s analysis of CryptoQuant’s data revealed BTC’s net deposit on exchanges was dropping, hinting at low selling pressure. Its MPI was green, meaning that miners were selling fewer holdings compared to its one-year average. However, at press time, BTC’s aSORP was red, suggesting that more investors were selling at a profit. In the middle of a bull market, it can indicate a market top. Source: CryptoQuant Apart from aSORP, a few other metrics also raised red flags. For instance, AMBCrypto’s analysis of Glassnode’s data revealed that BTC’s accumulation trend score had a value of 0.0107. The accumulation trend score is an indicator that reflects the relative size of entities that are actively accumulating coins on-chain in terms of their BTC holdings. A value closer to 0 means that investors are distributing or not accumulating BTC. Source: Glassnode Apart from this, BTC’s fear and greed index had a value of 72. This meant that the market was in a “greed” phase, which often results in price corrections. So, AMBCrypto analyzed BTC’s daily chart to see which direction it was headed in the short-term. We found that BTC was testing its resistance at the $67.3k mark at press time. Likewise, its price remained above its 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-25 Additionally, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) also registered an uptick, suggesting that BTC might flip its resistance into its support.

In fact, the token’s price had reached a critical level, and a breakout above could result in a massive bull rally in the coming days. According to CoinMarketCap, XRP’s price has risen by more than 3% in the last seven days. In the last 24 hours, the token has witnessed a 1.5% rise in its value.

Thanks to the recent price increase, the token’s price was moving towards the upper trendline of the pattern, hinting at a possible breakout. A successful breakout could result in a 40% rally, allowing XRP to reclaim its March high. But before it reaches that level, it must go above resistance zones at $0.55 and $0.6. AMBCrypto then analyzed Santiment’s data to find whether metrics supported the possibility of a breakout. As per our analysis, buying pressure on XRP was high as its exchange outflow spiked. Its Supply on Exchanges dropped, further proving that investors were buying. Source: Santiment Whale activity around the token was high, as evident from the rise in its whale transaction count. In fact, AMBCrypto reported earlier that whales accumulated XRP worth over $55 million. However, the derivatives market metrics looked pretty bearish on the token. For instance, Coinglass data revealed that XRP’s long/short ratio dropped in the last 24 hours. A decline in the metric suggests bearish sentiment in the market, where there is more interest in selling or shorting assets.

It all depends on…  Bitcoin recorded a notable hike recently, with gains of 4.9% seen over the past week. This uptick has contributed to a broader bullish trend across the cryptocurrency market. Analysts are now closely monitoring various indicators to predict what might lie ahead for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. One such analyst, Willy Woo, shared his insights on the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) Oscillator for Bitcoin, discussing its potential implications for future market movements. Woo’s analysis on the social media platform X delved into the VWAP, a technical indicator that averages the price of an asset while considering the volume of transactions at each price level. This approach gives more importance to price levels with higher trading volumes, providing a more balanced view of price movements.  For Bitcoin, Woo specifically examined the VWAP using on-chain volume, which benefits from the transparency of the blockchain to provide clear data to all observers. The focus of Woo’s study is the VWAP Oscillator, which measures the ratio between Bitcoin’s spot price and its VWAP, displaying this relationship in a form that oscillates around zero. Source: Willy Woo on X Recent trends revealed that the VWAP Oscillator has been in negative territory for the past few months, but is now on an upward trajectory. Should this continue, it could soon reach the neutral zone, signaling a potential shift in market dynamics. Historical data also seemed to indicate that when the VWAP Oscillator exits the negative zone and starts to climb, it often precedes a period of bullish momentum for Bitcoin. The price typically continues to surge until the oscillator peaks in positive territory and begins to decline. According to Woo, this pattern means that “there is still a lot of room to run before a reversal or consolidation occurs,” making it a challenging time for bearish investors in the market. Further supplementing these bullish observations, a CryptoQuant analyst also highlighted an increasing number of purchases from retail investors. According to the analyst, they have now bought roughly $135.7 million worth of Bitcoin over the past month alone. Source: CryptoQuant This buying spree aligns with a spike in Bitcoin’s daily active addresses, as shown by Santiment’s data. The number of daily active addresses surged from approximately 49,000 to over 66,000 in a single day, illustrating a significant hike in market activity. Source: Santiment From a technical analysis perspective too, Bitcoin’s chart on the 4-hour timeframe showed some promising signs. The appearance of a bullish abandoned baby pattern followed by a bullish engulfing candlestick that closes above its predecessor is a particularly positive bullish signal. Source: BTC/USDT, TradingView These technical patterns align with Woo’s prediction, indicating that Bitcoin might be gearing up for more gains. Notably, one of the catalysts behind BTC’s current bullishness is the release of the latest CPI data which was slightly lower than the expected 0.4%, as previously reported by AMBCrypto.  ::2024-05-18T04:00:32::N/A::Samuel Edyme::Bitcoin::https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/News-Articles-FI-Editors-2-1000x600.png

Dogwifhat [WIF] has been the darling memecoin for the cryptocurrency sector since quite some time. With a large number of investors backing up the memecoin, the token witnessed massive growth. However, due to recent price fluctuations, traders have suffered significantly when it has come to WIF’s price action. Over the last 24 hours, more than $1 million worth of long positions have been liquidated. This has occurred due to the significant price decline that WIF saw during this period.  The price of the memecoin fell by 7.26% and was trading at $2.59 at the time of writing. This decline wasn’t a momentary correction and was part of a larger trend. Since the beginning of May, the price of WIF had declined. During this period, the token showcased multiple lows and lower highs, indicative of a bearish trend. The CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) also fell significantly during this period, implying that the overall flow of money into the token declined. Coupled with that, the RSI (Relative Strength Index)also fell, indicating that the bullish momentum around WIF had waned materially. If WIF’s price continues to face this kind of selling pressure, it could move past the $2.4794 level soon. Source: Trading View Due to this decline in price, traders had turned skeptical. AMBCrypto’s analysis of Coinglass’ data indicated that the percentage of short positions taken by the bears had increased to 52% over the last few days. The overall sentiment of the traders could further drive down WIF’s price going forward. Also, AMBCrypto’s examination of Santiment’s data revealed that Social Volume around WIF had declined significantly. This meant that the number of negative comments around the token had surged. The declining Social Volume coupled with the declining Weighted Sentiment can add significantly high amounts of selling pressure. Source: Santiment Is your portfolio green?

Yet, BTC was at a local resistance level. BONK could reach a supply zone soon. A BONK technical analysis by AMBCrypto earlier this month predicting a 15% drop and a subsequent 30% rally proved right. What could come next for the meme coin?  Source: BONK/USDT on TradingView In the past two months, BONK has traded within a range (purple) that extended from $0.0000286 to $0.0000136. The mid-range mark (dotted white) at $0.0000212 has also served as a support level. This formed a range within a range, and BONK saw a bounce from the mid-range level on the 13th of May. This came during the GME hype period, the token has performed well since then. Despite the 28.6% gains in the past six days, the CMF showed a negative reading of -0.11. This indicated significant capital outflow from the market. Hence, even though the RSI reflected bullish momentum with a reading of 61, it appeared that the selling pressure and the range high resistance could reject the meme token bulls. Source: Hyblock The one-month look-back period of the liquidation heatmap highlighted what the technical analysis already laid out. The $0.00002 and $0.00003 levels have the highest concentration of liquidity levels nearby. Realistic or not, here’s BONK’s market cap in BTC’s terms Therefore, it is likely that we see a move to $0.00003-$0.0000315 to collect this liquidity before a bearish reversal. To the south, the $0.0000186-$0.0000201 level could provide a stable demand zone.

Binance Coin’s [BNB] momentum declined over the last week as the coin didn’t showcase much volatility. However, this might be the prelude to a massive rally, as BNB’s price was sitting at a crucial level that could allow it to reach a new all-time high. The last week remained relatively less volatile, as the coin’s price moved down by just 1.5%. In fact, in the last 24 hours, the coin didn’t move much.  According to CoinMarketCap, at the time of writing, BNB was trading at $580.59 with a market capitalization of over $85.6 billion. But investors must not lose hope, as the coin has a trick up its sleeve. AMBCrypto’s analysis of the coin’s price chart revealed a bullish pennant pattern. BNB entered the pattern in mid-March and, since then, has consolidated inside it. At press time, the coin was close to breaking out of the bull pattern. A successful breakout could translate into a massive bull rally, allowing it to go above its March highs. If things fall into place, then the coin might as well go above its ATH of $661 in the coming weeks or months. Source: TradingView A few of the on-chain metrics also looked pretty optimistic for the coin, as they supported the possibility of a breakout of the bullish pattern. For instance, BNB’s Funding Rate remained low. Generally, prices tend to move the other way than Funding Rates, hinting at a price uptick in the coming days. Source: Santiment Another good news was that the coin’s trading volume declined over the last few days, while its price action remained bearish. This meant that investors were not actively trading BNB, suggesting that the bearish trend might last longer. However, sentiments around BNB remained bearish, as evident from its low Weighted Sentiment. Another concerning metric was the coin’s Long/Short Ratio, which dropped at press time. A low ratio denotes a bearish sentiment, in which there is a greater inclination to short or sell assets. Source: Coinglass AMBCrypto then analyzed BNB’s daily chart to better understand whether the coin is expecting a breakout. As per our analysis, BNB’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) moved sideways near the neutral mark. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also followed a similar trend. Is your portfolio green?

Cardano [ADA] has surged back to the $0.48 price point, which is a major turnaround as billions in investments move from loss to potential profit. This comeback comes at an important time for holders who bought at or above this threshold, changing the sentiment from red to a promising green. Investors who placed their bets on ADA at the average price of $0.48 are now seeing their patience pay off. With the token reclaiming that value, those previously underwater are finally breaking even.  A predominantly bullish sentiment is showcased by IntoTheBlock’s data, which indicates a “Mostly Bullish” outlook by investors at press time. This upswing is underpinned by a modest 0.11% net network growth and a 3.08% increase in holders ‘In the Money,’ meaning that a larger number of investors are seeing profits. Source: IntoTheBlock However, investors should remain cautious, as the dashboard also reveals a -7.46% drop in large transactions, suggesting a decrease in major institutional activities. Furthermore, a notable bid-ask volume imbalance (-16.57%) points towards potential selling pressure. This means it is necessary to be vigilant of market dynamics in order to ascertain the sustainability of this rally in ADA’s price. The one-hour ADA trading chart showed an uptick in price movement, briefly touching the $0.48 mark before consolidating around $0.4776 at press time. The volume spike accompanying the price rise confirmed strong buyer interest at lower price levels. But the bulls are still not in full control. This consolidation indicates a balancing act between the bulls and the bears, with neither side taking definitive control. Source: TradingView Read Cardano’s [ADA] Price Prediction 2024-25 Given the current consolidation pattern and the observed trading volume, ADA may continue to test the $0.48 resistance.

A significant decrease in its daily trading volume has put Polkadot [DOT] at risk of another decline. Volume is not necessarily an indicator of a price increase. If the trading volume increases, it means that there is a lot of exchange going on with a token. Conversely, a decline in the metric suggests that interest in a cryptocurrency has decreased. For Polkadot, data from Artemis.xyz showed that the volume was $137.80 million. This was one of the lowest the project has seen since the second quarter of the year began.  However, the price of DOT has increased by 6.61% in the last seven days. But a massive decline in the volume could be a stumbling block to that hike. Source: Artemis Previously, there have been predictions that DOT could ride back to $10. If the volume pumps as the price increases, then this forecast might become a reality. But that was not the case, as rising prices and decreasing volume indicate weakness in the trend. As such, DOT could swing between $7.15 and $7.60 in the short term. Furthermore, AMBCrypto looked at Polkadot’s development activity as this was one aspect the project has dominated. According to Santiment, development activity on the network was 2.92. Two days ago, the reading of the metric was 2.20, indicating that more codes have been committed to ensure that Polkadot functions properly For some projects, a rise in development activity is a bullish sign for the price. But for DOT, it is not always the case. Sometimes, DOT’s price rises with the metric. Other times, the price does not follow. Therefore, this network improvement cannot be said to be a propeller to drive the token’s value higher. Apart from this, AMBCrypto checked the social volume. When social volume increases, it implies that the search for a project is increasing. On the other hand, if the social volume dwindles, it suggests that arbitrary text linked to DOT is on the decline. Source: Santiment At press time, Polkadot’s social volume jumped on the 17th of May. On the 18th, the metric fell. For the price, this means that demand for DOT was low. Hence, a 25%+ price increase might be unattainable in the short term. Meanwhile, the metrics discussed here are not the only one that has the potential to influence DOT’s price. Is your portfolio green? Check the Polkadot Profit Calculator To get a full understanding, other on-chain indicators like network growth can also impact the value. If the network growth rises, demand for DOT could lead the price to increase. However, that has not been the case, indicating that DOT’s potential to hit double-digits might not be an option this month.  ::2024-05-19T09:00:37::N/A::Victor Olanrewaju::Polkadot::https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/polkadot-news-and-volume-1000x600.webp

As the market condition started to get exciting with several cryptos registering green, Cardano [ADA] also didn’t disappoint. In fact, ADA bulls entered the market as the token’s price broke above a critical resistance zone, hinting at a massive bull rally ahead. CoinMarketCap’s data revealed that Cardano’s price had increased by more than 8% in the last seven days, as it gained bullish momentum on the 15th of May.  At the time of writing, the token was trading at $0.4848 with a market capitalization of over $17.29 billion, making it the 10th largest crypto. However, the recent price pump wasn’t enough to allow the majority of ADA investors to earn profits. As per our look at IntoTheBlock’s data, over 58% of ADA investors were out of money. But this scenario might change soon as ADA broke above a bullish pattern. World of Charts, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet highlighting that ADA’s price broke above a bullish flag pattern that formed on its 8-hour chart. As per the tweet, ADA was almost running on 10% profit, and the pump could allow the token’s price to surge by 100%. If that happens, then investors might witness Cardano touching $1 in the coming weeks. The $1 target might be pretty ambitious in the short term. Therefore, AMBCrypto assessed ADA’s metrics to find where it is headed this week. As per our analysis of Santiment’s data, ADA’s MVRV ratio improved, which can be inferred as a bullish indicator. Its trading volume also remained high while its price surged, acting as a foundation for the bull rally. However, Cardano’s velocity dropped last week. This meant that ADA was used less often in transactions within a set timeframe. Source: Santiment Most market indicators also hinted at a continued price uptick. For instance, ADA’s price remained above its 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). The MACD displayed a clear bullish advantage in the market. On top of that, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) registered a sharp uptick, indicating a further price hike.

Our analysis revealed that Cardano would witness a massive hike in liquidation near the $0.492 mark.

However, if it manages to break above that, then its price might touch $0.5 or $0.528 this week.

Seeing a positive outlook of GBTC among investors, an X (formerly Twitter) user, @osf_rekt said, Source: OSF/X This transition has resulted in over $17 billion in withdrawals, largely due to higher fees than other options. Additionally, a series of bankruptcies within the crypto industry over the last two years compelled companies to withdraw funds to meet creditor obligations. Interestingly, on the 15th of May, all spot Bitcoin ETFs, apart from BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), reported inflows. Simultaneously, on a similar day, Grayscale’s GBTC notably recorded its first inflows in a week, drawing in $27 million. This highlights that institutional investors are showing interest in Bitcoin, bringing liquidity, while crypto whales remain less enthusiastic. Data from Santiment, analyzed by AMBCrypto, indicate that while whales slowed accumulation, retail investors are increasing, promoting network decentralization. Source: Santiment This trend of retail accumulation could benefit Bitcoin in the long run by promoting greater network decentralization. Highlighting May’s positivity for spot Bitcoin ETFs, Eric Balchunas, Senior Analyst at Bloomberg, noted, “The bitcoin ETFs have put together a solid two weeks with $1.3b in inflows, which offsets the entirety of the negative flows in April- putting them back around high water mark of +$12.3b net since launch.

But it also depends on the money and exchange flow.::The golden cross suggests potential bullish trend for SHIB. But it also depends on the money and exchange flow.  Shiba Inu [SHIB] posted an 11.69% increase in the last seven days. However, the token has been struggling to maintain that momentum over the last two days. Irrespective of that, some technical indicators suggest that the price could get back to its rally. One of the signals AMBCrypto observed was the golden cross on the 4-hour SHIB/USD chart. To get a golden cross, traders look at the Exponential Moving Average (EMA). This pattern forms when the shorter EMA crosses above the longer EMA.  At press time, the 20 EMA (blue) had crossed over the 50 EMA (yellow)—A golden cross, indicating a bullish trend. Furthermore, SHIB’s price had not slipped below the 50 EMA, meaning the thesis has not been invalidated. However, the Money Flow Index (MFI) was down to 30.21. This decrease indicates that a lot of capital has flowed out of the SHIB market. In a bearish situation, this could lead the price to $0.000022. However, the MFI might likely hit the oversold point, which could be around 20.00 or below. Should this be the case, the price of the Shiba Inu native token might rebound. Sustaining the golden cross if (when) this happens could take the price higher. Source: TradingView The likely first stop could be $0.000027, after which, SHIB’s value could rise to $0.000030, which was close to the ceiling it hit in March. For this, considering the technical aspect alone might be enough. Hence, AMBCrypto took things from the state of the token on-chain. In doing this, we assessed the exchange inflow and outflow. If the exchange inflow is higher than the outflow, it means that the token involved could face selling pressure, and the value could drop. On the other hand, a higher exchange outflow favors a price increase. As of this writing, SHIB’s exchange outflow was 53.20 billion. The inflow, at the opposite end, was 50.55 billion. Historically, the 3 billion difference between the metrics might not be enough to support a one-directional movement. As such, SHIB’s price might consolidate in the short term. Source: Santiment From our outlook, the price might move between $0.000023 and $0.000025. Going forward, traders might need to keep an eye on the netflow. In a case where the outflow doubles the exchange inflow, then we might see SHIB’s price move upward slowly. If sustained, a breakout to $0.00030 could be achieved. Read Shiba Inu’s [SHIB] Price Prediction 2024-2025 A summary of the analysis suggested that this rise could come to pass before the end of May. However, there is a likelihood that this prediction could be invalidated. Thus, traders might need to watch for changes in the status of Shiba Inu on-chain, and from the technical perspective.  ::2024-05-19T06:00:59::N/A::Victor Olanrewaju::Shiba Inu::https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/shib-news-and-price-in-may-1000x600.webp

::Short-term BTC holders have started accumulating at a massive level.  Bitcoin [BTC] witnessed a massive bump in price over the last few days, causing a surge in optimism amongst traders. But it wasn’t just traders that were showing optimism around BTC. In the last few days, the Short Term Holders (STH) supply saw a net increase of over 20,000 Bitcoin. U.S. ETFs accumulated 11,000 Bitcoin during the same period, even when considering outflows from the Hong Kong ETFs. This suggested significant demand from other sources, as reflected in the price movement.  This increased demand from STHs creates a positive feedback loop. As more people buy in, the price goes up, attracting even more buyers. This can accelerate price increases. However, it’s important to remember that STHs are typically more likely to sell quickly on price dips, potentially leading to higher volatility. So, while STH accumulation is a positive sign for Bitcoin’s short-term momentum, it could affect BTC’s long term growth. Source: glassnode Another indicator of the rising number of Short Term Holders would be the declining Long/Short ratio. A falling long/short ratio suggested that the number of long-term holders accumulating BTC were declining. These long-term holders are more likely to keep their holdings during violent price fluctuations, which could also impact BTC negatively in the long run. The MVRV ratio for BTC had surged in the last few days, indicating that a large number of addresses holding BTC had turned profitable. This could add selling pressure on BTC, as STHs may be incentivized to sell their holdings for profit. Source: Santiment Whale behavior would also play a great role in determining the price of BTC in the future. In the last few days, whales have been stagnant in terms of accumulation of BTC.

Chainlink [LINK] has gained much traction of late as its price rallied substantially during the last week. Interestingly, the token’s popularity rose while Bitcoin [BTC] dominance witnessed a slight drop in the recent past. Let’s take a closer look at what’s actually going on. Source: CoinStats IntoTheBlock recently posted a tweet highlighting quite a few interesting developments related to Chainlink.  The tweet first mentioned that there was a significant rise in LINK search trend data, reflecting newfound interest in the token. The rise in popularity had a positive impact on the blockchain’s network activity, as its number of transactions started spiking. To be precise, LINK recorded 5.82k transactions during the last day, which was near its monthly high. However, it was interesting to note that the rise in transactions didn’t help attract more users, as there was not a major change in its new address graph. But things looked good in terms of investors’ interest as accumulation increased. As per the tweet, there were mostly net withdrawals from exchanges, hinting at accumulation behavior. Apart from that, whales were also stockpiling LINK, as its addresses holding over 0.1% of the supply show a net accumulation of 25 million LINK over the past month. The rise in accumulation actually helped the token begin a bull rally. According to CoinMarketCap, LINK was up by more than 20% in the last seven days. At the time of writing, it was trading at $16.22 with a market capitalization of over $9.5 billion. Thanks to that, LINK’s MVRV ratio registered a massive increase, suggesting that more investors were in profit. Its Open Interest also increased along with its price, hinting at a continued price rally. Source: Santiment Interestingly, Santiment recently posted a tweet highlighting that bullish sentiment around the token increased. In fact, Chainlink was witnessing the most bullish sentiment in over a year. However, these positive metrics didn’t help LINK sustain its bull rally, as the token’s price dropped by nearly 2% in the last 24 hours. To see whether this was the end of LINK’s double-digit bull rally, AMBCrypto analyzed its daily chart. As per our analysis, the MACD remained in the buyers’ favor. Is your portfolio green?

This indicated that the latest price correction might be short-term and that LINK would resume its rally soon. However, the token’s price had touched the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands, which looked concerning.

Toncoin [TON] has witnessed a spike in whale activity on its network in the past few weeks, CryptoQuant analyst Joao Wedson found in a new report. According to Wedson, whale transactions between 100,000 and 1 million TON on the network recently surpassed $1 billion, “Indicating significant activity among the largest addresses on the network.” Wedson added that while the smaller transactions under 100 TON make up the vast majority of the total activity on the Toncoin network, although,  “Their impact is relatively low, moving only around 4 to 5 million TON on the blockchain.” In contrast, large transactions between 100,000 and 1 million TON account for more than half (53%) of the network’s total volume. Further, transactions exceeding 1 million TON currently represent 30% of Toncoin’s total volume. Despite the surge in whale activity on its network, TON is poised to breach the lower line of its ascending channel, which formed a key support level since the beginning of the month. When an asset’s price trends this way, it signals that selling pressure is overcoming buying pressure, and a price decline might be imminent. TON’s recent fall below its 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) increases the likelihood of its price decline. Readings from the coin’s price movements on a daily chart showed that TON’s price crossed below its 20-day EMA on the 17th of May. This marked the first time this has happened since the month began. This crossover is significant because it suggests that TON’s press time price has fallen under its average price of the past 20 days. It marks a shift toward selling momentum and a possible decline in the coin’s price. Since then, TON’s value has dropped by 3%. According to CoinMarketCap, the altcoin traded at $6.45 at press time. Confirming the rise in bearish sentiments, TON’s MACD line was about to fall below its signal line at the time of writing. Source: TON/USDT on TradingView Is your portfolio green? Check out the TON Profit Calculator When this happens, it would mean that the coin’s short-term moving average has crossed below its long-term moving average, signifying a loss of upward momentum. If TON breaches support, its price might fall under $6 to trade at $5.70. However, if this is invalidated, a rally toward $6.7 is in the books.  ::2024-05-19T02:00:23::N/A::Abiodun Oladokun::Altcoin::https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/TONCOIN-1000x600.png

It is generally believed that the U.S. SEC will not approve any applications for the spot Ethereum [ETH] ETF due to several factors pointing to the fact that the agency’s new crypto enemy is Ethereum. But still, no real confirmation has been gotten from the agency itself on what it’s planning. So there is still a chance, no matter how slim, that the SEC would approve these ETFs. However, if they do, is the market ready for that impact? How would Ethereum’s price react?  Coinbase institutional research analyst David Han suggests there could be a surprising upside. In Coinbase’s monthly outlook report published on the 15th of May, Han mentioned that the odds of approval are between 30-40%. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has similarly set his approval odds at 35%. Meanwhile, the crypto community took a survey from Polymarket and the general estimate is 7% odds of approval. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, echoed the somewhat optimistic sentiment during an appearance on CNBC, saying that the SEC might approve spot ETH ETFs even if it does consider Ethereum a security Should the SEC approve an Ethereum ETF, the market could see an unexpected surge. However, Ethereum’s dominance and recent performance are trending toward their lowest point ever. Its SEC-proclaimed status as a security has negatively impacted investment sentiment. No one expects an approval, so Ether prices could likely see very little action in the near future. Bitcoin’s [BTC] price hardly reacted to its ETF approvals earlier this year. And the community were actually looking forward to it. Recently, the Funding Rate has been relatively low or negative, which could imply a cooling off of bullish momentum or increased caution among traders, especially during price dips as it happened in mid-April. Source: Coinglass Moreover, the increase in Open Interest despite lower trading volumes suggests that traders might be preparing for significant price moves ahead, as positions are being built up. But Ethereum’s trading chart shows a consistent bullish trend over a two-day period. The highest price point just above $3,160 could act as a short-term resistance level.

Dive in, HODLers, and discover BONK’s potential (and pitfalls) in 2024! Bonk Coin (BONK), the meme-tastic token of the Solana (SOL) blockchain, has captured attention with its explosive growth and vibrant community. But with meme coins notorious for volatility, investors are left asking: Is Bonk Coin a good investment gem or a fleeting pump-and-dump? This guide dives deep into BONK’s intricacies, exploring its potential, risks, and price analysis to help you navigate the hype and make informed investment decisions. Buckle up for a journey into the wild world of meme coins, where barking loudly doesn’t always guarantee success. BONK is self-termed as the “first Solana dog coin for the people by the people.” But how does that reflect on the investment front? Let’s find out! Is Bonk Coin a risky investment? – Image via Bonk Coin BONK was launched amid low sentiment in the Solana community due to the FTX collapse. The initial development of the project kicked off in the middle of 2022. On December 25, 2022, half of the total supply of BONK was distributed as an airdrop to the community members of the Solana ecosystem. Over the short time it has been live, BONK has quickly gained momentum, attracting over 619,000 unique holders. Currently, it is listed on more than 30 exchanges. This demonstrates its appeal and growing influence within the cryptocurrency space. BonkSwap was launched in April 2023 as an independently owned automated market maker (AMM) decentralized exchange (DEX) platform to expand the ecosystem further. It has a current total value locked (TVL) of 2.8 million, as reported by DefiLlama. BONK has established itself as the third-largest meme coin in the cryptocurrency market, trailing behind the renowned Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), according to CoinMarketCap data. It also holds a position among the top 100 cryptocurrencies globally, highlighting its significant presence within the digital asset landscape. As of the latest figures, BONK boasted a market capitalization of $811,705,546. The 24-hour trading volume stood at $85,783,812, showcasing considerable activity and investor interest. In terms of its token metrics, BONK revealed a circulating supply of 63,333,513,043,628 tokens, accounting for approximately 67.72% of its total supply. Bonk Coin price history – Image via TradingView Since the onset of 2024, BONK has navigated through significant bearish challenges. It was initially undervalued in the first week of January. This suggested a potential for price appreciation. Subsequently, a surge propelled the price to its peak resistance at $0.000016 within the analyzed timeframe. However, this peak was followed by a rejection, initiating a downtrend that persisted until the price found support at $0.0000098, preventing further declines. As February progressed, there was another bullish attempt to elevate the price beyond the resistance at $0.000012. Despite crossing this threshold, the price failed to sustain above the higher resistance level of $0.000013, resulting in another dip. At the time of writing, BONK was trading at $0.0000128, edging closer to its support level at $0.000012. Over the past week, BONK’s price has declined by 1.4%, with an approximate 3% decrease observed in the last 24 hours. This indicated that selling pressure has intensified, potentially due to investors taking profits or reacting to broader market conditions. The asset’s performance was reflected in its indicators. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) exited the oversold territory in the second week of January, staying below the midpoint of 50 until after the first week of February. The February rally marked a positive shift in the market, evidenced by the RSI reaching 61.03 mid-month, coinciding with the price momentarily surpassing $0.000013. However, the RSI fell to 51.52 following the price decline, suggesting a weakening of bullish momentum. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator also showed interesting movements, entering positive territory as BONK tested its peak resistance. Despite a dip below zero by the end of January, it rebounded in February, with its current value at 0.08. The trading volume mirrored these market dynamics, starting low and increasing with the price surge in January. However, it declined following the downturn and, despite a slight recovery in February, has not reached the peak levels observed during the initial surge. The recent price rejection was again accompanied by a decrease in trading volume, indicating a cautious market sentiment. Should I buy Bonk Coin? – Image via TradingView Reviewing the overall performance of the BONK, it reached its all-time high (ATH) in December 2023, a milestone that aligned with its listing on Coinbase—a phenomenon often referred to as the “Coinbase effect.” This event significantly boosted the token’s price, underlining its legitimacy and expanding its visibility due to Coinbase’s extensive user base. Despite this peak, the token’s value has seen a decline since. However, the market still showed a hint of bullish sentiment. Over the last month, the token appreciated by approximately 10%, and it has seen an impressive year-over-year increase of about 1300%. This performance is considered favorable for the token. Looking ahead, as BONK approaches its current support level, the asset’s ability to sustain or rebound from this point could signal its short-term trajectory and investor confidence in its value stabilization or potential for recovery. Moreover, if the bulls can sustain a rally and break through the resistance level at $0.000016, BONK could potentially be closer to approaching its ATH once more. Achieving this would necessitate a significant shift in market dynamics alongside positive developments that could foster a strong buying sentiment within the market. For 2024, a speculative yet optimistic target price for BONK could be $0.00002, assuming the sentiment in the market shifts favorably. Conversely, a reversal to bearish sentiment could see the price falling back to its lowest support level, posing a critical challenge for the bulls to uphold the support level and avert further declines. While initially dismissed as a mere memecoin, BONK is actively building an ecosystem to increase its utility. This includes: Factors to consider before investing in BONK Since its debut, the project has been progressing with significant development and engagement from the core BONK contributors. You’re encouraged to delve into all the features this memecoin project offers by visiting the website provided.

Bonk stands out with several distinctive features: As we conclude our exploration of Bonk Coin’s potential as a long-term investment in 2024, it becomes evident that while it presents certain opportunities, it also carries inherent risks. Its technological innovations, market dynamics, and community support all play pivotal roles in shaping its trajectory. However, the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies underscores the importance of conducting thorough research and exercising caution. Ultimately, whether Bonk Coin is deemed a good long-term investment hinges on individual risk tolerance, investment goals, and the ability to adapt to the ever-changing landscape of the digital asset market. In the realm of cryptocurrencies, informed decision-making remains paramount, paving the way for a resilient and profitable investment journey.

::Mission Moon or Woof Gone Wild? Unleash the secrets of Shiba Inu’s 2024 price trajectory with expert predictions, hidden risks, and explosive potential revealed. Don’t miss the ride! Shiba Inu (SHIB) took the crypto world by storm in 2021, with its meme-fueled popularity propelling it to astronomical heights. But many are asking: How high can Shiba Inu go in 2024? Can it recapture its former glory and reach even greater heights, or is it destined to remain a fleeting trend? In this blog, we delve into price predictions, key market influences, and potential roadblocks to uncover the possible trajectory of SHIB in the coming year. So, buckle up, SHIBArmy, as we embark on a journey to answer the burning question. Adopting a comprehensive approach is crucial to grasping the potential future of the memecoin. So, we’ll delve into the market dynamics and observed price trends of SHIB, offering insights into its performance and prospects. Shiba Inu market SHIB’s weekly chart over the past year painted a picture of a cryptocurrency grappling with bearish pressure. However, bulls were not entirely absent from the market. It all began in February 2023, when the price was rejected from a peak resistance at $0.000014. This triggered a series of declines. A number of bullish rallies were observed throughout the year. However, a significant barrier for these rallies was established at $0.000010. According to data from CoinMarketCap, SHIB’s value depreciated by approximately 22% over the last year, marking a significant downturn. Notably, since October 2023, there has been a slight bullish momentum in the market. Entering the new year, the price trajectory of SHIB has hovered close to its current support level of $0.0000087. At the time of analysis, SHIB was trading at $0.0000095. But all is not bad for SHIB. Over the past seven days, the token has appreciated by around 8%, with a moderate 0.2% increase over the last 24 hours. This recent performance suggests a tentative recovery in the short term. Estimate your potential earnings from SHIB investments with our Shiba Inu Profit Calculator. SHIB price analysis – Image via TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) fell below the 50 line towards the end of February 2023. In August, it reached as high as 55.58 but quickly retracted. It crossed above the 50 line again in November, aligning with price movements, and reached a peak of 64.19 in mid-December as the price re-tested its resistance at $0.000010. However, following the price’s rejection, the RSI also fell. There was a brief period at the end of January when it dipped below 50, but it has since recovered to its current value of 54.58, indicating that bullish momentum is still present in the market and that bulls are fighting to keep their gains. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) moved into negative territory between June and September, indicating selling pressure. However, there was a temporary move above the zero line in August, and since October, it has risen continuously. As the analysis concluded, it stood at 0.19, suggesting a shift towards bullish sentiment, albeit within a volatile market context. The trading volume, reflecting market dynamics, decreased significantly amid increased bearish influence. However, recoveries in volume were observed coinciding with bullish activity, indicating active engagement from traders during these periods. However, since January, the volume has remained on the downside, reflecting the ongoing challenges. Looking ahead, the future prospects of Shiba Inu face a significant challenge at the current resistance level of $0.000010. Overcoming this hurdle is crucial for any positive momentum, with the next key resistance set at $0.000014. This level has been difficult to surpass, with the price failing to maintain momentum above it since May 2022. A breakthrough could propel SHIB to as high as $0.00002 by 2024, contingent on significant developments within the SHIB ecosystem and the emergence of positive catalysts. If SHIB reaches this price level, it could set the cryptocurrency on a trajectory toward attaining its all-time high (ATH). Currently, the price of SHIB is 88.81% lower than its ATH, indicating a substantial gap to bridge for a full recovery. Shiba Inu future value – Image via TradingView The current support level is closely monitored by bears, and although there have been moments when the price momentarily dipped below this threshold, bulls have successfully maintained it. The most bearish scenario could see SHIB’s price falling to as low as $0.0000056. Despite this potential downside, the general sentiment within the industry and market remains optimistic regarding SHIB’s performance, suggesting a belief in the token’s resilience and potential for recovery.

If any of these key institutions were to go bankrupt, they would likely take sizable market chunks down with them. This guide explores some of the most impactful crypto bankruptcies, which have changed how the industry considers compliance, security standards, risk management, and the associated economic consequences. Over the years, numerous failed crypto projects have led to eventual crypto bankruptcies. While we shall discuss a number of these in detail, here’s a quick summary of some of the key events. In 2014, the Mt.Gox bankruptcy was led by a host of security breaches and resulted in a loss of 850,000 BTC. Then, there was the QuadrigaCX bankruptcy, which resulted in sizable investor losses due to financial mismanagement and lack of proper risk management strategies. Perhaps the most well-known crypto bankruptcy, however, was the FTX collapse in late 2022, led by the now-convicted Sam Bankman Fried. Companies in #crypto that have gone bankrupt Three Arrows Capital Celsius Network Terraform Labs Voyager Digital Core Scientific Babel Finance Hodlnaut Genesis BlockFI Zipmex FTX Blockchain Global And these are only a handful of failed crypto projects. Read on as we thoroughly explore the notable crypto bankruptcies, with the most recent events explained first. Did you know? Investigative sleuthers and handles like CoffeeZilla can help you track the status of both new and established crypto projects. This can help you navigate the space better and stay informed about possible scams, rug pulls, and other crypto bankruptcies. Genesis Global, a popular crypto trading and lending firm, imploded due to the severe liquidity crisis. Let us delve deeper into the aspects that impacted the positioning of this Digital Currency Group subsidiary. Genesis Global was overexposed to several less-than-transparent firms, including FTX and Three Arrows Capital. So when those institutions imploded, the entire machinery of Genesis Global felt the ripple effect. Genesis Global even kickstarted the Barry Silbert-led DCG group’s downfall as the extensive lending operations backfired. Here’s how on-chain metrics could have saved investors: Before Genesis Global filed for bankruptcy protection, the Genesis Trading OTC address transferred: – 50,000 $ETH($77.6M) #Coinbase; – 20,000 $ETH($31M) to #Bitstamp; – 5,000 $ETH($7.76M) and 3.9M $USDT to #Kraken; – 7.7M $FTM ($2.35M) to #Binance; – 36M $USDC to new address. pic.twitter.com/cMMKpLdVJs Eventually, the company filed for Chapter 11 (bankruptcy protection), listing liabilities to the tune of $11 billion. Over 100,000 creditors, per the company details, were impacted. The bankruptcy proceedings are ongoing, and a number of investors are still waiting to receive any compensation. In terms of recovery plans and asset sales, Genesis intends to sell shares to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and other establishments to raise approximately $1.6 billion. The FTX crisis was the primary bear market event, where most cryptocurrencies bottomed out. As we know, Solana (SOL) was one of the majorly impacted cryptocurrencies. Uncle Sam Bankman Fried. FTX balance sheet is like US bank balance sheets. Assets valued on what they were bought for, not what they can be sold for. “FTX is fine” is like the assurance that “the US financial system is resilient”. We don’t hear this except when it’s not fine. https://t.co/FRXHwSv8QJ pic.twitter.com/kEKAw6j08v FTX was one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. However, in November 2022, a series of investigative insights highlighted that this firm was working too closely with sister firm Alameda Research, also founded by Bankman-Fried. Customer deposits on FTX were being misused to cover Alameda’s losses. As the news broke, FTX experienced a bank run with many users trying to withdraw funds at the same time. As the exchange couldn’t meet the massive bankruptcy requests, it was forced to file for bankruptcy on Nov. 11, 2022. FTX and the concerned affiliates reported having assets and liabilities in the $10 billion to $50 billion range. Following the meltdown, a new CEO, John Jay Ray III, was appointed to navigate and oversee the restructuring process. Andrew Dietderich, an FTX Lawyer, stated in January 2024 that FTX creditors and customers will be paid in full. This process is still in the works. At present, the now-defunct organization plans to distribute $9 billion to cover some compensation claims. BlockFi, a leading crypto lending firm, was impacted by the financial distress experienced by FTX. It is known that BlockFi extended a $400 million credit line to FTX in addition to several direct investments. Crypto failures are interconnected: A judge is still yet to sign off on a settlement that will see BlockFi receive $874.5 million in claims against FTX and Alameda Research, while FTX will drop its claims against BlockFi. https://t.co/YQiIhqzd5V When FTX experienced a liquidity crisis, the perils of financial mismanagement rubbed onto BlockFi. The company had exposure to FTX and Alameda Research, which ensured that most of the assets were unrecoverable after the FTX collapse. While filing for bankruptcy, BlockFi reported assets and liabilities in the $1 billion to $10 billion range. These included $355 million worth of locked cryptocurrency on FTX and a defaulted loan worth $671 million to Alameda. The recovery efforts associated with BlockFi are ongoing. There has been a judicial decision concerning a repayment of $300 million to the creditors. Recovery percentages vary anywhere between 39% and 100%. This Singapore-based crypto hedge fund shut shop in June 2022. Here is what went down and how the market was impacted. The fund had heavy exposure to volatile crypto strategies and assets. Plus, there was significant leverage involved. Also, when the TerraUSD debacle led to LUNA’s death spiral and a major correction across multiple cryptocurrencies, the liquidity crisis for 3AC became harder to manage. The fund couldn’t meet margin calls associated with its leveraged positions and went bankrupt. OPNX, the crypto exchange and claims trading platform set up by the founders of Three Arrows Capital, will cease operations and shut down this month. @tikta_ reportshttps://t.co/QUAqcw6mpk 3AC filed for Chapter 15, securing assets from U.S. creditors amid liquidations. The total creditor claims reached as high as $3.5 billion, whereas the estimated assets, as of July 2023, stood at $1 billion. While the bankruptcy proceedings are ongoing, it is believed that 46% of the credit claims could be responded to. Celcius was a leading firm in the staking and lending space. The company declared bankruptcy in July 2022. The collapse of the Terra-Luna ecosystem was one of the major reasons that Celsius was forced to file for Chapter 11. The company was over-leveraged, made a series of poor investment decisions, and was pushed to the brink by a rapid withdrawal of funds by nervous investors. The recovery efforts seem to have concluded, and in January 2024, the company distributed assets worth $3 billion to creditors. Plus, the company has also revealed its plans to establish a Bitcoin mining entity to generate compensatory revenue further. So I finally got my distribution yesterday in the @CelsiusNetwork #Bankruptcy case. What's crazy (aside from how long it took & still no word on the shares) is that I'm getting some seriously convincing #phishing emails. The phishing emails are ones that are specifically related… pic.twitter.com/1OJfpEqGAH Voyager, a brokerage and lending firm, entered bankruptcy proceedings in July 2022. Voyager’s implosion followed the TerraUSD crash. As 3AC went down, it defaulted on a large credit line extended to 3AC, which caused unrest and negatively impacted Voyager’s health. At the time of filing — July 2022— Voyager reported liabilities worth $5.7 billion. Voyager initially planned to sell its assets to FTX U.S. for $1.4 billion, a move that would have helped creditors recover almost 72% of the claims. However, before this could happen, FTX collapsed, too, leaving the deal to fall through. As of 2024, the company has managed to return funds worth $270 million to the clients, and it even entered a deal worth $1 billion with Binance U.S. 1/ As soon as the news that #BinanceUS was preparing to bid for the bankrupt lending platform Voyager Digital came out, the price of $VGX rose from $0.288 to $0.442, an increase of 53.5%.https://t.co/6VLPn2t9zH pic.twitter.com/fBG33te8rP This means Voyager customers could potentially expect 35.72% of their claims to get addressed. The collapse of the Terra ecosystem didn’t only impact the U.S-based firms. The ripples were felt globally. Hodlnaut, a Singapore-specific lending platform, was also forced to shut shop following these events. The company faced severe liquidity issues and halted swaps, withdrawals, and even deposits in August 2022. It had allowed users to borrow against crypto deposits, a use-case that eventually made it vulnerable. When the market began correcting, the value of Hodlnaut’s collateral started dipping, leading to a massive liquidity shortfall. The company is going through a restructuring phase led by judicial inputs. This Southeast Asia-based cryptocurrency exchange catered to Thailand, Indonesia, Australia, and Singapore before going bust in 2022. The financial distress surrounding Zipmex amplified when two of its biggest borrowers, Celsius Network and Babel Finance, started facing a liquidity crisis. The loans were defaulted, exposing Zipmex’s erroneous financial stance. Marcus Lim, CEO and co-founder of Zipmex, denied that the firm was facing insolvency issues just days prior. https://t.co/fr2eI2Wc8X The company is still involved in a restructuring process presided over by the Singapore court. During the bankruptcy filing, Babel Finance and Celsius owed $48 million and $5 million to Zipmex, respectively. It isn’t only about lending firms or exchanges impacted by bankruptcies. Core Scientific, one of the largest Bitcoin miners in North America, filed for Chapter 11 in December 2022. An extended bear market followed by rising energy costs, increased mining difficulty, and piled-up debts were some of the reasons that Core Scientific had to shut shop. As of 2024, Core Scientific has emerged from the bankruptcy hit, mining 19,274 BTC in 2023 alone. Its post-bankruptcy reorganization process is complete, and it is also currently trading on NASDAQ (as of April 23, 2024) at close to $3 per share. Today @Core_Scientific have released their production for the last 24 hours and it appears they have taken full advantage of the transaction fees spike since the halving, producing a total of 57.3 #BTC equating to $3.72 million in revenues. 🚀 Hashprice revenues increased from… pic.twitter.com/XMA5xF5DDI Even mining firms need to diversify business operations and revenue streams to mitigate the threats of market volatility. It is worth noting that most of the crypto bankruptcies in 2022 were interconnected, exposing the over-reliance of key players on major liquidity providers and creditors. Even though 2022 and even 2023 saw the most impactful cryptocurrency bankruptcies, such events really started back in 2014 with the Mt.Gox bankruptcy. Since then, several crypto bankruptcies have surfaced, every now and then, led by security breaches, financial mismanagement, exit scams, and others. Here’s some insight into some other key events. This Australian crypto firm declared voluntary administration or bankruptcy in November 2021, led by a culminating debt that exceeded $15 million. Plus, one of its subsidiaries, the Australian Crypto Exchange or ACX, also halted its operations at that time, putting additional pressure on Blockchain Global. ACX, an Australian crypto exchange, declared bankruptcy in February 2020. The company ceased its exchange abruptly. Investor losses worth $10 million were recorded, which in turn forced the Victoria Supreme Court to issue a freeze order on ACX’s BTC holdings. This Singapore-based exchange declared bankruptcy in February 2020. Its controversial transaction mining business model fueled concerns of unsustainable cash flows. Accusations involving financial mismanagement and concerns related to exit scams and related frauds sealed the deal. This U.S-based crypto lending platform filed for Chapter 11 in 2020, driven by fraudulent activities, mismanagement, and poor investment choices. Cred gave out high-interest loans to moKredit and other third-party entities, expecting high profits — a move that backfired. Plus, a fraudulent asset manager was accused of misappropriating 800 Bitcoins via an entity called Quanticon. https://t.co/Xq2VseEfV5 Cred had a license to print money, and a blockchain ecosystem to do it on – and now they are filing Chapter 11 Bankruptcy driven by terrible risk controls. Looks like they over leveraged internal positions and had external loans go sour. Did you know? James Alexander was named as the fraudulent asset manager who was implicated in the 800-BTC fund misappropriation fiasco. This New Zealand-specific exchange was breached in 2019, with hackers managing access to the user wallets. The hack led to huge financial losses and forced Cryptopia to shut down operations and liquidate. QuadrigaCX was one of the largest Candian exchanges, which went bust after the unexpected death of Gerald Cotten, its CEO. Cotten, supposedly, was the only person with access to the firm’s cold wallets, and his death ensured a loss of almost $190 million in customer funds. Some folks still consider it one of the better-devised exit scams. 🚨LATEST: Canadian Province Asks QuadrigaCX Co-Founder to Explain His Wealth in New Order The Bitconnect bankruptcy or shutdown was essentially a disguised Ponzi scheme. The platform was aggressive in offering a 40% return to users, primarily by reinvesting user funds. However, the regulatory crackdown stunted its operations, leading to investor losses to the tune of $1 billion. Mt.Gox was once the largest Bitcoin exchange. In 2014, it experienced a massive security breach worth 850,000 BTC, led by poor management, technological flaws, and security lapses. Investors indulged in extended legal battles until 2021, when the rehabilitation plan for the distribution of assets was approved. MtGox Creditors Receive Update on Token Withdrawal 🚨🚨#MtGox has updated the official website form, providing details on expected tokens and payment statuses for creditors. The distribution of 142,000 #BTC, 143,000 BCH, and 69 billion yen is anticipated by October 31, 2024. Besides the mentioned cryptocurrency bankruptcies, there were a handful of other scams that impacted the associated companies beyond measure. Here are the notable ones: In 2016, Bitfinex, one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges, was hacked. Almost 120,000 Bitcoins were compromised, accounting for a massive loss figure of up to $72 million at the time. Even though they managed to avoid bankruptcy, a controversial strategy of introducing BFX tokens to make customers whole was introduced. It is worth noting that platforms launching tokens just for the sake of covering losses or raising capital isn’t a good practice. It can also be a major scam-specific red flag. The DAO, a venture capital body backing Ethereum, faced a smart contract hack in 2016. Almost $50 million worth of funds were compromised, which didn’t lead to bankruptcy but caused a split across the Ethereum community — a fork separating Ethereum Classic and Ethereum. This anomaly in 2017 started as a multi-sign vulnerability specific to the Parity wallet. However, it quickly escalated into a $280 million ETH freeze. This issue highlighted the risks associated with smart contract bugs. 2017 Parity wallet hacker begins moving $ETH into @TornadoCash#PeckShieldAlert ~990 $ETH into @TornadoCash from Parity Multisig Wallet Exploiters. pic.twitter.com/VESvN0XL9F This Japan-based exchange suffered a huge security breach in January 2018. Hackers stole NEM or XEM tokens worth $534 million from the exchange’s hot wallet, resulting in reputational and financial damage. The company eventually compensated investors using its own capital. Babel Finance had to go through a restructuring process in 2022 as it faced liquidity issues and had to halt withdrawals. Customer funds worth $280 million were compromised, citing that Babel sought bankruptcy protection in 2022. However, the court granted them an extension and time to restabilize and restructure. While everything looks well with Binance operationally, the largest crypto exchange has faced its share of issues. The CEX was ordered to pay $4.3 billion as part of a settlement with the Department of Justice. Plus, it continues to be at the center of endless regulatory scrutiny. While the exchange has been limited in a number of locations across the globe, the CEX has ramped up compliance efforts to the extent that it will resume operations in India in 2024. Good news for Crypto India! 🇮🇳#Binance is coming back to India, paying a $2 million penalty, and seeking compliance with PMLA! pic.twitter.com/iivm4oySP4 While investors do not have any control over crypto bankruptcies, there are a number of precautions that can be taken. Ensure to invest time in due diligence, opt for portfolio diversification, rely on cold wallets, and only interact with regulated platforms. As always, never invest more than you can comfortably afford to lose. The FTX collapse was one of the largest cryptocurrency bankruptcies. It happened due to misuse of customer funds and financial mismanagement. FTX used billion of dollars to cover losses at Alameda Research, leading to a liquidity crisis and eventually pushing the firm to the brink of bankruptcy proceedings. While there is no concrete list, many crypto companies have failed over the years, led by regulatory challenges, security breachesm, market volatility, and the team members pulling exit scams. The notable ones include the QuadrigaCX bankruptcy, the Cryptopia bankruptcy, BitConnect bankruptcy, and the Mt.Gox bankruptcy. Each instance highlights crucial lessons from crypto failures and the importance of regulatory compliance and risk management across the crypto industry. The recovery efforts following the FTX bankruptcy are ongoing. The now-defunct exchange has been able to recover over $7 billion to repay customers. The proceedings and repayment plans are being looked at by the bankruptcy court to streamline the process. Yes, individuals associated with the BitConnect scam had to bear legal consequences. For instance, Glenn Arcaro, one of the top BitConnect promoters, pleaded guilty to wire fraud and conspiracy and was enetually imprisoned. The BitConnect scam was around $2.4 billion and can be termed as one of the more infamous crypto exit scams. The platform promised high returns via a proprietary trading algorithm but went belly up, leaving behind significant investor losses.

To learn more on how we evaluate each piece of content, please proceed to our verification methodology page Argentina’s economic landscape has been marked by persistent challenges, including high inflation, currency depreciation, and deep economic crises. In response to those issues, many Argentinians have turned to crypto to safeguard their wealth and avoid prohibitive regulations that damage purchasing power. This guide explores the significant growth of cryptocurrency adoption in Argentina. We examine the underlying factors, their impact on various sectors, and the potential role of digital currencies in addressing the nation’s economic concerns. Since 2017, Argentina has experienced a significant upswing in crypto adoption. This was catalyzed initially by the first bullish surge in the crypto market. The momentum was further reinforced by subsequent crises in the country, each marked by high inflation and currency depreciation. Figures from the Crypto Council For Innovation suggest that one-third of Argentinians use crypto for everyday transactions in 2024. This level of adoption can be attributed to heightened awareness among the population regarding the advantages of decentralized financial systems. This is particularly the case in the context of preserving purchasing power during times of economic turmoil. The rise in cryptocurrency adoption has led to a flourishing ecosystem of crypto startups and companies in Argentina. From blockchain development firms to cryptocurrency apps and exchanges, these entities play a pivotal role in providing innovative solutions to the economic challenges faced by the population. As of 2024, a number of crypto startups are operating in Argentina, showcasing the entrepreneurial spirit driving the integration of digital currencies into the mainstream financial landscape. These companies include Ripio, SatoshiTango, Decrypto, Lemon, and Koibanx. Argentina’s strict currency controls since 2020 have led to a surge in the use of stablecoins. The asset class is a practical solution for individuals seeking to bypass traditional financial constraints. A 2023 report by Bitso, a Mexican crypto exchange, indicated that 60% of the crypto trading volume in Argentina comes from stablecoins, such as USDT or USDC. This underscores an increasing reliance on stable digital assets, pegged to less volatile currencies like the U.S. dollar, to navigate the challenges of accessing hard currency in a regulated environment. Cryptocurrency adoption in Argentina prompts a critical examination of whether digital assets could solve the nation’s persistent currency challenges. While challenges such as regulatory uncertainties and price volatility persist, the potential transformative impact of crypto on the economic landscape is undeniable. A wide sector of the population increasingly views crypto as a viable alternative to traditional banking systems. Recently elected president Milei supports this perspective. The Argentinian president, Javier Milie, also supports the use of crypto. This indicates a shift in government positions regarding the role of digital currencies in securing financial stability. The surge in cryptocurrency adoption in Argentina is backed by compelling statistics. These highlight the tangible impact of economic instability on choices made by individuals and businesses. The growth of crypto startups, the prominence of stablecoins, and the evolving public perception of digital assets all contribute to a dynamic landscape. As Argentina grapples with persistent currency challenges, the role of crypto is increasingly relevant, prompting a crucial discussion about their potential to reshape the nation’s economic future. Cryptocurrencies are gaining popularity in Argentina primarily due to the country’s high inflation and currency depreciation. Many Argentinians view digital currencies as a more stable store of value compared to the Argentine peso. Additionally, cryptocurrencies offer an alternative to traditional financial systems, which are often restricted by stringent government regulations. Stablecoins, which are digital currencies pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar, have become particularly popular in Argentina as a means to circumvent strict currency controls. They provide a more reliable way to preserve wealth and make international transactions without the volatility typically associated with unpegged cryptocurrencies. Approximately 60% of Argentina’s crypto trading volume comes from stablecoins. The rise in cryptocurrency adoption has led to the emergence of numerous crypto startups in Argentina, fostering innovation and entrepreneurship within the country’s tech sector. These startups not only provide solutions to economic issues through blockchain technology but also contribute to job creation and attract international investment. Companies such as Ripio, SatoshiTango, and Lemon are examples of how the crypto industry is influencing the broader financial landscape in Argentina.

To learn more on how we evaluate each piece of content, please proceed to our verification methodology page The Ethereum blockchain is arguably the biggest developer-centric ecosystem dealing with decentralized applications (DApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi). Yet, developers looking to Ethereum to build usable web3 resources do not simply start building on the mainnet. Instead, they rely first on testnets. This guide discusses one popular testnet, Rinkeby. Read on to learn about this vital Ethereum test network. Testnets are used to support test transactions. Developers user testnets to try out implementations that use frameworks such as Truffle and the Solidity programming language. This allows DApps to be tested and improved without developers encountering the financial burden and risks associated with the main Ethereum blockchain. Rinkeby is one such testnet. Even though the Rinkeby testnet and Rinkeby faucet were deprecated as of 2024, assessing their role in facilitating robust DApp development can help both new and advanced developers better understand Ethereum test networks. The Rinkeby testnet for Ethereum DApp testing came into existence in 2017. It focused specifically on smart contract testing and quickly became vital to the Ethereum development environment. Rinkeby operated as a proof-of-authority (PoA) testnet at a time when Ethereum itself was proof-of-work (PoW), as was Ropsten, one of the other popular testnets. BREAKING: Ethereum's testnet Ropsten successfully transitions to PoS Over the years, the Rinkeby network emerged as a particularly stable option. The network offered something similar to a “Controlled Node Validation” environment and supported predictable testing scenarios. The Rinkeby testnet community quickly became one of the most active, offering reliable and quick feedback on smart contract execution. Meanwhile, the PoA consensus ensured the testnet became one of the best for developers looking to continuously test setups and integrations. Did you know? Controlled Node Validation, in the case of Rinkeby testnet, refers to a system where only a limited number of entities (trusted) are allowed to confirm and validate transactions. Rinkeby was one of the more popular Ethereum test networks used to quickly test smart contracts and DApps. The Rinkeby testnet was a controlled sandbox-like environment replicating the Ethereum blockchain environment. Developers could deploy applications on this testnet before introducing them to the mainnet. As for the testnet gas fees, some faucets gave out made-up ETH or “test” ETH. Rinkeby Faucet was one such test ETH tap, associated specifically with the Rinkeby testnet. Trusted node operation was another technical aspect of the now-defunct Rinkeby testnet. Just like the mainnet, where validators have both block-creation and transaction-confirming power, in the case of Rinkeby, this was handled by trusted entities or individuals operating the nodes. As mentioned previously, the Rinkeby faucet employed the PoA consensus mechanism, which supports faster transactions and, therefore, quicker tests. Only validated accounts approve the blocks and transactions, which made the testnet more secure than other options. As PoA facilitates speed and efficiency, Rinkeby became an obvious choice for developers looking for quick iterations and feedback. When active, Rinkeby was extensively compared to the likes of Kovan and Ropsten. Kovan followed the same PoA consensus as Rinkeby. However, Rinkeby was more popular as it was supported by Geth, Ethereum’s most popular client. Ropsten resembled Ethereum closely as it was a PoW testnet, much like Ethereum before 2022. However, Ropsten often encountered issues due to spamming and forking, making Rinkeby all the more popular. New testnets surfaced for Ethereum since the merge. Kiln (now also deprecated) was one example. Kiln, the next iteration of Ethereum merge testnets, is now live 🔥🧱 Highly recommended that node operators, application developers, stakers, tooling/infra providers test their setups on the network. Blog post has all the info to get started 😁https://t.co/TCHBZxcFlt Simply put, the Rinkeby faucet is like a tap that distributes test ETH, allowing developers to test DApps repeatedly without worrying about gas fees. The Rinkeby faucet provides test ETH when you connect your Ethereum wallet address or MetaMask wallet address to the faucet website. Once done, you can redirect the faucet tokens to your MetaMask address, provided you have selected the testnet network. Even though Rinkeby isn’t available in 2024, you can try this process with Sepolia. In some cases, testnet ETH caps are used to avoid network abuse. “Testnets help three distinct groups of users: client developers, application developers and node operators/stakers/miners, but, the needs of each of these are quite different!” Notably, with faucets like Rinkeby’s, the DApp and DeFi development cycle becomes cost-effective. This is because developers have time to perfect their resources before launching them on the mainnet. Here are a few specific Rinkeby testnet features that made it different from other faucets: Rinkeby transactions were publicly available, like Ethereum, via a dedicated explorer. This tool, termed Rinkeby Etherscan, was useful for the following tasks: Now that the Rinkeby testnet is no longer available, users can only access Rinkeby Etherscan as an archived tool. The Arbiscan Rinkeby Testnet explorer by @etherscan is now live! 🎊 Navigate through all of your activity on our testnet with this beautiful new explorer! 🔎 👉 https://t.co/XM1HeoZ1Gw pic.twitter.com/1gE4h7lLLV Clarity around node setup and maintenance of the popular testnet should help set up and maintain future iterations. Here are the things you should note about the Rinkeby testnet: Here is a quick table comparing the Rinkeby testnet with some of the other popular names (all deprecated): The Rinkeby testnet and faucet are no longer active. While the Ethereum Foundation discontinued their use in 2023, the testnet and faucet were officially deprecated on June 15, 2022. Here’s why: BREAKING: #Ethereum Goerli testnet successfully merges to proof-of-stake. With Rinkeby out of the equation, Sepolia is the only Ethereum test network in play in 2024. This testnet serves as a reliable alternative, thanks to its PoS consensus. This precisely checks security enhancements, validator performance, and staking. While the Rinkeby Ethereum network and the Rinkeby faucet are no longer active, the importance of testnets in the Ethereum development environment cannot be overstated. From launching a cryptocurrency on Ethereum to exploring innovative DeFi use cases or DApp testing, testnets are lifelines for developers and crucial to successful blockchain development. You cannot use the Rinkeby Ethereum network anymore in 2024. However, when it was active, it was used for Ethereum DApp testing, smart contract testing, and for other use cases across the Ethereum development environment. A testnet faucet like the Rinkeby faucet is a tool or service distributing free test cryptocurrency, including test ETH to the testnet users. The faucet for testing Ether is takes care of the testnet gas fees for developers interested in Ethereum test transactions. ETH is the actual cryptocurrency specific to the Ethereum blockchain. Goerli ETH, on the other hand, is the testnet faucet ETH that doesn’t have any real-world value and is simply made-up Ethereum. However, Goerli ETH once traded at a premium due to massive demand, an issue that was combatted using testnet caps. A testnet is meant for testing real DApps before they are deployed to the mainnet. For instance, developers indulging in Rinkeby testnet deployment focused on testing smart contracts and DApps on the Rinkeby Ethereum network first, using testnet gas fees to check stability, security posture, and other aspects.

To learn more on how we evaluate each piece of content, please proceed to our verification methodology page Azuro has launched a new decentralized betting protocol built on blockchain technology. The innovative protocol packs a one-two punch of smart contracts that automatically handle bets and DAO governance, where the community calls the shots. While Azuro is indeed a promising new player, does it have enough clout to disrupt established giants? Can it truly revolutionize sports betting? We explore these questions and more in this detailed guide. Azuro is an on-chain prediction layer for EVM chains. It offers a suite of modular tools, oracle solutions, and liquidity management for developers building on EVM-compatible blockchains. This modular approach allows for the creation of powerful prediction and gaming applications. At its core, Azuro is an innovative infrastructure and liquidity layer specifically designed for on-chain predictions. It brings along a unique liquidity pool design called the Liquidity Tree, which dynamically maintains and creates market liquidity. In other words, this unique design of the liquidity pool keeps the betting action flowing smoothly by constantly adapting to handle new sports markets and all sorts of games. The best part is that anyone can get in on the action. Azuro’s open framework allows developers to create new apps, features, and even entirely new betting products, all built on top of Azuro’s foundation. The Azuro Protocol consists of a suite of smart contracts that can be constantly upgraded. These smart contracts work together like building blocks to enable anyone to create their own prediction apps and games. Azuro offers pre-built components that make creating applications on its protocol an easy task. Want to dive deeper? Yo ucan check the audits of Azuro smart contracts here. The Azuro DAO is the brain trust behind the whole operation. It is powered by an AZUR token, which gives the community a say in how things work. This means more community involvement and decision-making — the power is in the people’s hands! One of Azuro’s biggest strengths is its approach to money. By combining resources into one big pool, Azuro offers deeper liquidity than traditional betting options. Its tooling and Oracle solutions are designed to work smoothly across any blockchain, starting with those compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Moreover, Azuro’s open design philosophy means that launching a prediction site or app is not only cost-effective but also risk-free and achievable in just a few hours. Overall, Azuro isn’t just about picking winners and losers. Rather, it’s about rethinking risk, ownership, and how we participate in betting in this blockchain era. It brings along a giant pool of resources to attract users and power a sophisticated platform for decentralized predictions and gaming. Azuro aims to compete with traditional betting giants like Stake.com by focusing on community-driven solutions and breaking down barriers. Azuro’s betting action revolves around its Prediction Engines, a complex system governed by smart contracts. These contracts are not just the brains behind creating conditions — they also handle the nitty-gritty, such as processing bets, calculating payouts, and even rewarding affiliates. These engines are plugged into the pool through something called the Factory. The Factory contract facilitates the deployment of Pools and their corresponding Betting Engines. This way, the platform ensures that all betting activities are managed securely via the LP contract. A look at the core components of Azuro’s blockchain architecture: Azuro currently has two engine types: Both engines inherit their core logic from the CoreBase contract, which serves as the platform’s foundation for all multi-outcome betting action. Every market on a Pool within the Azuro ecosystem is called a Condition. Data providers manage these Conditions, which are basically information packets containing everything you need to know about a bet. This includes game details, odds, potential payouts, and even how much money is backing each side (reinforcement) and the house commission (margin). A pre-match Condition might include specifics like the game ID, how much you’d win on each outcome, virtual funds used to set the odds, and the total bets placed. This level of transparency ensures a fair and reliable betting experience for everyone. A Pool in Azuro is essentially a cohesive system of smart contracts that forms the backbone of the betting platform. Anyone can deploy a Pool using the Factory contract, which includes the LP contract (the main gateway to the Pool’s operations) and the Access contract (which facilitates easy control over the Pool’s functions by its owner). This structure allows the Pool owner to integrate an unlimited number of Betting Engines, which further improves the platform’s flexibility and functionality. Odds in Azuro aren’t just numbers — they’re the essence of every bet that tells you you how much you stand to win versus what you put down. Here’s how it works: odds are calculated by comparing the total pool of money in a Condition to the funds allocated for each specific outcome. This calculation creates a dynamic system where the odds evolve as bets are placed. This way, it ensures that the betting environment remains fair and reactive. Initially, the platform sets the odds using the virtual funds distributed among the outcomes when the Condition is first created. As the game progresses and more bets roll in, these odds are fine-tuned to match the changing landscape. Doing so ensures that every bettor is on a level playing field. Reinforcement acts as Azuro’s financial safety net. It allocates initial liquidity to each game depending on the betting odds at setup. This way, it makes sure that there’s always enough money to cover wins. This method caps the pool’s potential losses, demonstrating Azuro’s proactive approach to risk management. Azuro’s liquidity borrows heavily from the segment tree design from computer science. The unique structure makes cash handling seamless. Each deposit becomes a “leaf,” part of a bigger tree that offers a real-time snapshot of where money stands. Add, pull out, or shuffle funds around for games — it’s all streamlined to keep the betting smooth and steady. This innovative peer-to-pool model supports thousands of liquid betting markets. It offers competitive odds and a rich set of features, including accumulators and multi-outcome bets. Additionally, it also transforms the blockchain betting experience by aligning it closely with traditional sportsbook offerings. Azuro’s Liquidity Tree not only enhances betting dynamics but also sets the stage for the growth of specialized prediction markets. Virtual Funds are crucial — they gauge how likely an outcome might be. The bigger the pot for an outcome, the slimmer the odds of it. As bets come in, these funds adjust on the fly, keeping the odds fresh and fair. It’s a built-in balancing act that ditches the need for manual tweaks and keeps the odds honest, protecting the heart of the betting action. As of late April 2024, Azura has so far raked in a net revenue of nearly $3 million. The total transaction volume on Azuro is approaching the $300 million milestone. Total number of transactions on the platform has surpassed 4.3 million, of which about 481,000 was in March 2023 alone. Azure boasts more than 22,000 unique users thus far, with more than 2,000 active monthly users on average. The platform boasts a network of nearly 4,500 liquidity providers, locking over $8 million in total value (TVL). Azuro announced the successful closure of its pre-launch funding in April 2024. The company confirmed that it had raised $11 million in total from several investors, including the likes of Fenbushi Capital, SevenX Ventures, Polymorphic Capital, Arrington Capital, and G1 Ventures. Red Beard Ventures, and Dewhales. This round was preceded by a strategic funding round of $4 million in 2022, which brought the total funds raised by the company up to the point to $7.5 million. “This new investment round arrives at a critical development stage for Azuro. We have recently entered the third phase of the Azuro Score program, the final step before the $AZUR launch,” Azuro is actively forging partnerships with key industry players to further polish and expand its offering. Thus far, efforts have been largely successful, with the platform joining forces with several leading blockchain and crypto companies. For instance, in January 2023, Azuro teamed up with Polygon. This move quickly bore fruit and Azuro’s monthly volumes soared to nearly $30 million, spread across about 500,000 transactions. By February 2024, Azuro emerged as the biggest revenue generator on Polygon PoS, which marked a significant milestone in accessibility and growth. Similarly, the platform’s partnership with Gnosis helps revolutionize the user experience. It keeps network fees low for high-volume, low-value transactions characteristic of games and prediction markets. On Gnosis Chain, fees are paid in xDai stablecoin, which significantly cuts down on volatility and streamlines transactions for users. The Graph is another of Azuro’s key strategic partners. Azuro leverages Graph’s powerful APIs to ensure data transparency. This alliance empowers users with real-time access to comprehensive market data, transforming how they interact with and understand the betting landscape. Similarly, In April 2024, Azuro announced a partnership with deBridge to address chain bridging, a key user experience challenge. The new collaboration integrates deBridge’s bridging and swapping solutions into applications built on Azuro’s infrastructure. This simplifies the transaction process for users on the Polygon and Gnosis networks by allowing them to move assets between blockchains more efficiently. These are just the proverbial tip of the iceberg when it comes to Azuro’s strategic partnerships. The company is actively pursuing new collaborations to expand its global betting market footprint. Azuro’s effort to shine the light on the follies of conventional betting platforms and its ability to bypass those weaknesses using blockchain technology has yielded a net positive result. The future of on-chain betting holds considerable promise so long as it can capitalize on the inherent strengths of cryptocurrencies. Some of these strengths include open design and the ability to create innovative financial applications. Azuro has uniquely positioned itself to leverage these strengths. The ecosystem offers a fertile ground for groundbreaking advancements, with possibilities for introducing entirely new risk layers to existing games, applications, and even the metaverse. Azuro leverages blockchain technology to offer a decentralized betting protocol, which is significantly different from traditional betting platforms. It uses smart contracts and a DAO governance model to ensure that operations are automated and the community has control over decision-making. This setup enhances transparency and empowers users, which is a stark contrast to the centralized nature of traditional betting systems. Azuro ensures fair betting by using a system called the Liquidity Tree, which adjusts the betting liquidity as needed to keep operations smooth. Additionally, each betting condition is transparently managed with clear information about the bets, odds, and payouts. This approach ensures that all participants have equal access to essential data. Yes, Azuro allows anyone with the technical know-how to create their own betting products using its platform. It offers an open framework and a suite of tools that enable developers to build and deploy new apps and features quickly. Azuro also offers pre-built components that make creating applications on their protocol really easy.

It’s also often a tactic used by blockchain-based startups to help bootstrap a project and create hype and awareness. With meme coin season in full swing in 2024, this guide covers everything you need to know about the Bonk airdrop. To select the top exchanges to buy BONK, BeInCrypto’s dedicated product team conducted testing over a period of six months. The criteria for the top exchanges covered areas including fees, availability, reputation, and safety. Here’s a small insight into why each platform was chosen. Coinbase As the most prominent U.S. based exchange, Coinbase is a top option for buying Bonk. The platform operates both a brokerage and an exchange. On Coinbase you can learn-to-earn, trade crypto and NFTs, and benefit from good customer service and a user-friendly interface. Gate.io One of the leading exchanges by trading volume, Gate.io gives users access to a huge selection of altcoins and advanced trading features. BeInCrypto found it easy to purchase BONK on Gate.io safely and securely. OKX OKX is another exchange that hosts a multitude of services. The exchange has a non-custodial wallet, a platform token for lower fees, and a blockchain. You can also earn crypto, trade derivatives, and use trading bots.

It presents itself as the Solana-based version of the well-known Dogecoin. As is common with meme coins, Bonk promotes a lighthearted and welcoming community around crypto. In December 2022, a Bonk airdrop was announced for the Solana community, with the token distribution completed by January 2023. In all, 50% of the currency’s entire supply was donated to Solana users. This strategy encouraged widespread ownership and activity in the Solana ecosystem. In 2024, meme coins have increasingly dominated both the Solana network and the wider crypto market. (Meme coins have) been the strongest performing sector in the crypto market so far in 2024, with many (…) pumping 10, 50, 100x. We had the rise of the Solana meme coins, with coins like BONK and WIF. The eligibility requirements for the Bonk airdrop were as follows: Airdrop snapshots are complete! People seem to be liking $BONK so far, 50 Trillion more $BONK (50% of total supply) will be landing over the next 24 hours to great NFT, Art, and Solana DeFi enthusiasts. The airdrop was intended to increase participation in the Solana ecosystem by distributing tokens broadly across its various user bases. The deadline for the snapshot has already passed, meaning users are no longer able to claim BONK airdrops. Links suggesting the airdrop is still open are likely to be scams. The popularity of BONK boosted transaction activity on the Solana blockchain. There was a discernible increase in trading activity following BONK’s listing on significant centralized exchanges such as Coinbase in December 2023 and again on Robinhood in March 2024. BONK’s price surged by 50% just by virtue of its placement on Coinbase, resulting in a rise in transaction activity on the Solana network. Notably, BONK’s trading volumes on Solana significantly exceeded those of other meme coins, demonstrating its supremacy in this area and boosting network activity overall. The charts above show a notable spike in the number of active addresses and transaction activity on the Solana blockchain between December and March. Peaks in active addresses and transactions line up with the aforementioned rises in BONK trading volume during those periods. Although a trend points to a possible connection between these occurrences, it’s important to remember that correlation is not causation. In the case of the Bonk token, while its activity has stunted as of late April 2024, Bonk remains one of the top ten meme coins by market cap. As of April 26, 2024, BONK is the sixth most popular meme coin in CoinMarketCap’s rankings. As for Solana, thanks to tokens like BONK, the network has become one of the most popular blockchains for meme coin trading, alongside Coinbase’s base chain. Whether or not interest in Bonk fades, Solana will likely remain a top platform for meme coin launches, thanks to its low fees and high throughput. In alignment with classic meme coin tokenomics, BONK has a max supply of 10 trillion. As stated previously, 50% went to community holders who interacted with NFT projects, early contributors, developers, and DeFi traders via a Bonk airdrop. The exact distribution was as follows: Bonk is one of the few meme coins that surpassed mere speculative value. The token has been integrated into a variety of DeFi and gaming applications. Here are a few of the key services that have integrated BONK: BONK’s rapid growth has been buoyed by 2024’s meme coin-friendly market. It’s particularly difficult to predict the future of meme coins due to their inherent volatility and speculative nature. Yet, BONK’s status as a humorous token with integrated utility and an expanding ecosystem parallels Shiba Inu’s ascension. While this comparison is bullish — considering SHIB’s growth and position as an established crypto in 2024 — there are no guarantees of gains when investing in BONK or any other meme coin. Remember that this particular sector is well known for its proliferation of scams and rug pulls. Only ever click official links, and remember to prioritize crypto wallet security at all times. The Bonk airdrop distributed crypto to Solana community members. Some of the users that received BONK were NFT projects and holders, DeFi traders, Solana developers, and early contributors. The airdrop was completed by January 2023. To have qualified for the Bonk airdrop, you must have interacted with the Solana ecosystem. This included select DeFi projects and NFT holders. The snapshot for the airdrop was completed in November 2023. Unlike most meme coins, Bonk has many uses. Users can use Bonk in many DeFi apps on Solana. Traders can also use it on Bonk specific apps like Bonk Rewards, Bonk Swap, Bonk Bot, and more. Some apps like Bonk Bot burns tokens. The Bonk DAO has proposed to burn a significant portion of Bonk tokens. However, the proposal has yet to finalize. Due to the exorbitant circulating supply of BONK, it is highly unlikely that BONK will reach $1 without intervention. BONK has a total supply of about 10 trillion. Burning BONK tokens can possibly cause the price to increase. While Bonk is one of the top meme coins, this asset class is a risky investment. Meme coins are extremely volatile and can lead to both losses and gains. However, Bonk is notably one of few meme coin projects that has uses outside of speculation.

To learn more on how we evaluate each piece of content, please proceed to our verification methodology page By facilitating decentralized peer-to-peer transactions, Bitcoin offers an alternative to traditional payments. Yet while transferring and storing value remain its primary functions, crypto inscriptions have introduced broader applications for the Bitcoin network. Inscriptions allow users to store data directly on the blockchain, such as images, audio, videos, and more. Even though this started with Ordinals on Bitcoin, inscriptions have spread to other networks, attracting a mixture of curiosity and concern among community members. This guide covers crypto inscriptions, their history, how they work, and the benefits and drawbacks they bring to decentralized ecosystems. BeinCrypto tested the top exchanges to purchase inscriptions over a period of six months. The criteria for the top platforms included fees, reputation, safety, products and services, and features. OKC, Gate.io, and Binance reflect the qualities seen in the top inscriptions platforms. Here’s why we chose each platform. Gate.io Gate.io is a global exchange that has low fees, a vast array of products and services, and wide availability for customers in various countries. Alongside inscriptions, customers can also stake, mine, trade derivatives, and a multitude of other activities. Binance As the world’s largest exchange by trading volume, Binance customers can enjoy low fees and tight spreads. In addition to its inscriptions services, customers can also trade spot, NFTs, futures, optons, on margin, and with trading bots. OKX OKX is an expansive exchange that allows users to not only trade crypto at low fees, but also use earn products, trade derivatives and spot, use trading bots, and trade on margin. Users can also trade peer-to-peer or or trade NFTs. To learn more about BeInCrypto’s Verification Methodology, navigate to the following webpage. Gate.io is an expansive cryptocurrency exchange that serves a global suite of users. On the platform customers can enjoy low trading fees, a wide variety of cryptocurrencies (including inscriptions and Runes), NFT trading, futures trading, and more. OKX boasts a large marketplace for inscriptions. Users can inscribe, exchange, and manage inscriptions, doginals, ordinals, and atomicals for free. Along with its wide range of products, OKX is well-known for its earn products, derivatives, and NFTs. Binance is the world’s largest exchange by trading volume. It has some of the lowest fees, a wide selection of crypto to choose from including inscriptions, and an assortment of products and services. Users can even take advantage of its proprietary BNB blockchain for developing or using decentralized applications (DApps). In the case of Bitcoin, inscriptions are metadata added to individual satoshis (sats), the smallest unit of BTC. Inscriptions arise from people inscribing sats with arbitrary content, creating Bitcoin-native digital artifacts. The rise of Ordinal inscriptions on Bitcoin occurred when Casey Rodarmor, a Bitcoin developer, created the Ordinals protocol, which launched in January 2023. The Ordinals protocol — made possible by the Taproot and SegWit upgrades — uses Ordinal Theory to number, identify, and track sats, allowing Bitcoin to support the creation and trading of tokens. When sats are inscribed, they can be transferred through Bitcoin transactions, directed to Bitcoin addresses, and stored within unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs). However, you’ll need an address that can receive Ordinals, as standard BTC addresses won’t work here. While Bitcoin Ordinals became popular in January 2023, the concept of non-interchangeable tokens on Bitcoin was not new. In the traditional Bitcoin framework, all Bitcoins were treated as equal. However, in 2012, so-called colored coins emerged as a method to represent and manage real-world assets on the Bitcoin blockchain. This allowed Bitcoin’s utility to expand beyond being a peer-to-peer currency. However, the additional “non-financial” data increased demand for block space, which strained Bitcoin nodes. Colored coins used “metadata injection” to add metadata. However, the method was inefficient and had capacity limitations. To address this, the Bitcoin community introduced the OP_RETURN function in 2014 as part of the Bitcoin Core 0.9.0 release. This function enabled users to “store” arbitrary data on a Bitcoin transaction output, preserving it within the Bitcoin block space. In 2017, the segregated witness (SegWit) update was activated on Bitcoin. Before SegWit, the OP_RETURN function stored arbitrary data within the transaction block, along with existing details such as the sender or receiver’s address, the transaction time, etc., on Bitcoin. SegWit separated signature information from transaction data, helping to optimize block space and making transactions cheaper. In 2021, the Taproot upgrade expanded upon SegWit’s foundation by introducing Schnorr signatures, which were more efficient, secure, and smaller, contributing to the overall reduction in transaction size. These advancements enable transactions to accommodate larger metadata payloads, resulting in faster processing times and reduced transaction costs. Introduced in January 2023 by Casey Rodarmor, Ordinal Theory was built upon its preceding developments. This made the creation of Bitcoin-native assets simpler. Ordinal Theory describes the systematic ordering of satoshis and the inscription of data onto them using the Ordinal protocol. Ordinals are satoshi’s numerical system, allowing tracking and data transfer. These designations, referred to as Ordinal numbers, are assigned to satoshis based on the sequential order in which they are mined. Users could now trade Bitcoin NFTs directly on the blockchain. With the creation of Ordinals, users can now inscribe content such as videos, images, text, PDFs, and audio onto individual satoshis. Shortly after introducing Ordinal Theory, Taproot Wizards, an Ordinal project, was launched in February 2023, featuring a collection of 2121 collectible digital wizards cards. Subsequently, Ordinals garnered considerable attention from established projects, leading notable entities like OnChainMonkey, DeGods, and Yuga Labs, the creators of the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT collection, to join the Bitcoin network. These inscriptions can be viewed and traded on various NFT marketplaces. The concept then spread to Ethereum and other Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible chains such as BNB Chain, Polygon, and Avalanche, where users, enticed by low transaction costs, started embedding data within transactions. Notably, Ethereum is the most popular blockchain for non-fungible tokens, featuring some of the top NFT card collections, such as CryptoPunks and BAYC. Data from Dune Analytics shows a notable surge in inscription volume on the Bitcoin blockchain. As inscriptions gained traction over time, the community expressed concerns about issues such as high transaction fees and the long-term effects on the scalability of the Bitcoin network. A Bitcoin developer, Luke Dashjr, called inscriptions a “bug” that needs to be fixed, saying that they were bringing vulnerabilities to the blockchain by embedding data on top of it. While critics have been vocal about the issues with inscriptions, in late 2023, Rodarmor criticized Bitcoin maximalists over their complaints and attempts to “censor” inscriptions. “Simultaneously believing that Bitcoin is unstoppable internet money and thinking that a bunch of [redacted] publishing JPEGs on-chain is any kind of problem is a contradiction.” After inscriptions hit the market, building upon the Ordinals protocol, developer Domo introduced the BRC-20 token standard, enabling the issuance of fungible tokens on the Bitcoin network. ORDI became the first BRC-20 token launched on Bitcoin. Following its launch, the idea gained market adoption, leading to BRC-20 marketplaces allowing the buying and selling of tokens. Crypto inscriptions allow users to embed data into satoshis. They are created by packaging arbitrary data, like an image or document, stored in Bitcoin’s “witness data.” This inscription data is limited to 520 bytes, while creating larger inscriptions requires linking them. The inscribed satoshi is transmitted to the network through two sequential transactions: a commit transaction and a reveal transaction. The commit transaction creates a Taproot output committing to the script with an inscription. Subsequently, the reveal transaction discloses the entire script, enabling the creation of the inscribed satoshi output. Upon transmission, these transactions enter the mempool, awaiting confirmation by miners. Once mined, the inscription becomes a permanent fixture on the Bitcoin blockchain. Users then employ tools such as the Ordinals Explorer to facilitate tracing and viewing of inscriptions. Unlike normal Bitcoin transactions or Ethereum NFTs, creating, minting, and tracking inscriptions necessitates running the proprietary “ord” client on top of a fully synchronized full node. The “ord” client, in conjunction with Bitcoin Core, enables users to inscribe individual satoshis and track them across the UTXO set. Without this client, a regular Bitcoin wallet cannot distinguish between inscribed and regular satoshis. Did you know? Casey Rodarmor created the first Ordinal inscription on the Bitcoin blockchain, inscription #0, on Dec. 14, 2022. The inscription was a pixel art representation of a black-and-white skull. Below are some of the benefits and drawbacks of crypto inscriptions as observed on the Bitcoin network, its pioneer use case. Crypto inscriptions are a significant advancement in digital assets. They allow the embedding and transfer of digital artifacts directly within the blockchain, creating new asset creation and transaction opportunities. While there are challenges, such as concerns about fungibility and blockchain scalability, crypto inscriptions have brought about more security, efficiency, functionality, and adoption. Inscriptions on Bitcoin are metadata added or “inscribed” onto Bitcoin satoshis (sats), which can be text, videos, images, or audio files. Each sat is assigned a unique identifier based on its transaction history, which allows for the tracing and identifying individual satoshis with inscriptions attached. The inscription market is a platform where users buy, sell, and trade inscribed assets on blockchain networks. Some exchanges that offer both NFT trading and inscription trading marketplaces are Binance, OKX, and Bybit. EVM inscriptions involve embedding data within transactions on Ethereum virtual machine (EVM)-compatible blockchain networks such as Polygon and BNB Chain. They leverage Ethereum’s smart contract functionality for purposes like token metadata storage or NFT creation. Inscriptions are just another way to create an NFT. Bitcoin NFTs, or inscriptions, are unique because, unlike other blockchains, they are stored directly on the blockchain. In Web3, inscription refers to embedding data directly into blockchain transactions to create unique digital artifacts. It enables you to turn digital assets such as audio, images, and video into unique items on the blockchain. Inscription is the general concept of embedding data onto the blockchain. In contrast, Ordinal is the unique identifier assigned to each satoshi (the smallest unit of Bitcoin) when an inscription is attached. EVM stands for Ethereum Virtual Machine. It is a component of the Ethereum blockchain that executes smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. EVM allows developers to write smart contracts in programming languages such as Solidity to develop decentralized applications (dApps) on Ethereum.

To learn more on how we evaluate each piece of content, please proceed to our verification methodology page Users looking for privacy-focused tokens have likely come across the Sam Altman-founded Worldcoin, a controversial iris-scanning crypto project launched in 2023. But what is Worldcoin, and how can you buy the native token, WLD? This guide demonstrates how to buy Worldcoin (WLD) and everything else you need to know. Our process for selecting the top platforms to purchase and store WLD was thorough and conducted over a period of six months. The criteria for selecting exchanges primarily considered availability, fees, features, and security. In the case of wallets, the criteria considered support of assets, reputation, wallet type, and safety. Exchanges Wallets To learn more about BeInCrypto’s Verification Methodology, please visit the link. If you’re looking to buy WLD, you must first choose a compatible platform. Here are five BeInCrypto recommended exchanges, all of which support Worldcoin. OKX is a global cryptocurrency exchange known for its extensive array of features that appeal to both novice and experienced traders. The platform provides access to various trading options, including spot and perpetual markets. Binance is the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. It offers an assortment of features, including derivatives trading (options and futures), trading bots, staking, mining, and more. Binance users can also enjoy lower trading fees when they hold the platform token, BNB. Gate.io is an exchange that offers a wide range of services. This includes a huge variety of cryptocurrencies, margin trading with various leverage options, and facilities for lending and borrowing. The platform is designed to serve a broad spectrum of users, from casual investors to seasoned traders. Coinbase is a beginner-friendly and intuitive brokerage and exchange. The platform offers a learn-to-earn program, which helps newcomers understand crypto investments through video classes and rewards. Additionally, the platform features crypto staking opportunities for earning yields. An easy-to-use, global crypto exchange, CoinEx stands out for its wide range of assets. The platform supports staking, futures, spot and margin trading and offers a range of “smart tools” for strategic trading. Notably, CoinEx does not require users to KYC before buying crypto, making it a solid option for users looking to buy WLD anonymously. While several platforms support WLD, we’ve used CoinEx for this demo. While the process may vary slightly depending on your chosen platform, the general steps will be the same. Here’s how you can buy WLD on CoinEx: 2. Add funds: Log into your account. If your account balance is empty, you must purchase a cryptocurrency you can swap for WLD. For this example, we will use USDT. 3. Search for WLD: Use the search bar at the top of the page to find WLD. Click on the correct option. 4. Swap your crypto: Once you have clicked “Worldcoin,” you will see the below interface. Input the amount of USDT you intend to swap for WLD. Double-check everything before clicking “Swap” to complete your purchase. If you plan to hold WLD, ensure you have a compatible crypto wallet to store your tokens safely. Worldcoin is a project that looks to solve the problem of proof of personhood. Proof of personhood is a mechanism that verifies a person is unique and human online. It’s an important part of establishing one’s digital identity. In a world with a lot of AI, knowing who is human matters more and more. Despite efforts to identify unique human users through CAPTCHA tests like clicking on fire hydrants, the challenge of proving personhood remains unresolved. This complicates online voting, financial activities, privacy, and security. Worldcoin accomplishes this in a decentralized way using zero-knowledge proofs, without the user revealing their real-world identity to prove they are a person. The Worldcoin Foundation is a non-profit organization started by Tools for Humanity. The non-profit supports the Worldcoin community and will continue to do so until it becomes self-sufficient. Sam Altman, Max Novendstern, and Alex Blania founded Tools for Humanity in 2019. Altman, a co-founder and CEO, also helped found OpenAI alongside Greg Brockman, Peter Thiel, and Elon Musk. Worldcoin is centered around World ID, a privacy-focused global identity network. Through World ID, users can verify their unique human status on any participating platform — this means no more clicking on traffic lights, cars, or buses. This method is Sybil resistant, supports fair airdrops, defends against bots on social media, and aids in the equitable distribution of scarce resources. Additionally, World ID could facilitate global democratic processes and innovative governance models, such as quadratic voting. It might also pave the way for an AI-funded universal basic income (UBI). UBI is a social welfare idea in which all people of a country or geographic area receive a regular, unconditional cash payout. However, Worldcoin (WLD) would replace cash in the Worldcoin UBI system. Worldcoin was launched amid much controversy in mid-2023. The project has faced strong criticism for its business model, which involves scanning people’s irises in exchange for cryptocurrency. Scanning and storing biometric data raises concerns about personal data security and access. Moreover, Worldcoin received an even stronger rebuke for collecting biometric data in underdeveloped nations. The project received its first half a million users from field testing in 24 countries, such as Ghana, Indonesia, Kenya, and Sudan. Some questioned the ethics of exchanging biometric data for cryptocurrency. This also raises concerns about exploiting those who might not fully understand the ramifications of surrendering their personal data. There are many ways to compare WLD to other cryptocurrencies. Here, we will compare Worldcoin to Bitcoin. There are many stark differences between BTC and WLD. For starters, WLD is an ERC-20 token, while BTC is a coin. This means that BTC has its own blockchain while WLD does not. Since WLD is an ERC-20 token, it can easily be stored in both hot wallets and cold wallets (such as MetaMask or Ledger). The Worldcoin token exists on both the Ethereum and Arbitrum blockchains. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is primarily a decentralized payment platform. This means that BTC holders can initiate transactions with each other without intermediaries. Worldcoin (WLD) is the incentive layer for onboarding users to its identity verification platform and other services. Lastly, Bitcoin has a market cap of over $1.2 trillion. This makes up 53.2% of the total cryptocurrency market cap, which is approximately $2.36 trillion as of April 26, 2024. WLD has a market cap of just under a billion dollars, sitting at $925 million. Within the Worldcoin ecosystem, there are four main primitives: World ID, Worldcoin, World App, and Worldchain. Here’s a quick look at each. World ID is a privacy-preserving proof of personhood, otherwise known as an anonymous ID. It uses zero-knowledge proofs to verify user identities online while protecting sensitive information. This is accomplished using a custom biometric device known as the Orb. The Orb is designed to be a long-term solution for AI-safe verification of personhood. World IDs are issued through the Worldcoin protocol. This protocol allows individuals to demonstrate their humanity to any verifier, including web2 applications. It maintains user privacy using zero-knowledge proofs. Some of the future plans include issuing other types of credentials on the Worldcoin protocol. World ID is intended to be “person-bound.” This means it can only be used by the individual to whom it was issued. It aims to be secure against fraud by unauthorized parties who might steal or acquire World ID credentials. Additionally, it is also possible for someone to recover a lost or stolen World ID. Worldcoin (WLD) is the token issued by the network. It aims to align participant incentives with the growth of the network by initiating network activity. This distribution is intended to bootstrap the development of useful applications on the network’s financial and identity infrastructure. The World App is the frontend for World ID and is available on Android and iOS. It assists users in completing verification through the Orb, manages their World ID credentials, and uses cryptographic protocols to share these credentials with third parties while preserving privacy. Designed to enable seamless access to global decentralized financial infrastructure, the app sets the groundwork for future integrations. Over time, it’s expected that many different crypto wallets will incorporate World ID. World Chain is described as a “blockchain for humans.” It prioritizes human users by offering them priority block space and a free gas allowance, making it easier for verified humans to start using the network. announcing world chain! while still early, 5m people have already verified with the orb, and over 10m accounts have been created. to continue accelerating, worldcoin will launch a blockchain that can eventually support every human. pic.twitter.com/HFag6ToaNt This blockchain will be open source, permissionless, and secured as a layer-2 solution on Ethereum, enhancing its scalability within the Optimism Superchain ecosystem. Its design encourages real-world applications by integrating World ID for Sybil resistance. The aim is for the community to govern World Chain. As a result, this setup will offer developers a platform to reach users with apps that focus on real-world utility. Once you have bought Worldcoin, you will need to find a secure wallet to store the token. Here’s a quick roundup of some of the top options in 2024. OKX Wallet is the proprietary wallet of the OKX platform. Users must keep in mind that OKX has a web extension and mobile app, the latter of which is custodial. The non-custodial wallet allows users to connect to DApps and import multiple token standards like ERC-20 or Solana SPL tokens. ImToken is a crypto wallet software company. It has a non-custodial hardware wallet and a mobile wallet that is available on iOS and Android. ImToken allows users to stake, browse, access DApps, and buy crypto all from one wallet. As the name implies, the Coinbase Wallet is the proprietary wallet of the Coinbase platform. It is separate from Coinbase Prime and allows users to self-custody their crypto, hold multiple coins and EVM-compatible tokens, and browse the internet or DApps. The Trust Wallet is an extensive web3 wallet that allows users to store, swap, and purchase crypto all in one place. Users can also access popular DApps directly from the wallet, which offers traders a level of safety. Math Wallet is a platform-agnostic wallet that allows users to hold crypto on more than one hundred blockchains on mobile, browser extension, and cloud. Users can also use the DApp browser to safely access decentralized applications via the app. Before investing in or using Worldcoin, there are a few things users should consider. Firstly, if you are interested in investing in Worldcoin, you should remain aware of its usage. Less than a year after its launch, the Worldcoin app reached over 4 million downloads. However, this momentum slowed as 2024 set in. As of late April 2024, there are more than over 5 million unique humans on Worldcoin. On the other hand, Worldcoin has close associations with OpenAI and Sam Altman — though it is not specifically an artificial intelligence project. Narratives dominate most of the popular sectors in crypto. Worldcoin’s proximity to Sam Altman and OpenAi may prove useful, with positive AI news often acting as a bullish signal for the price of WLD. Moreover, the project was seeded by several big-name venture capitalist firms. Some of these include a16z, Khosla Ventures, and Blockchain Capital. In its latest round of funding, Worldcoin raised $115 million, amounting to about $240 million in total from three funding rounds. Whether you should purchase Worldcoin depends on your strategy. If you are a long-term investor who believes in the vision of the Worldcoin ecosystem, consider that as of April 26, 2024, WLD is down from its all-time high but still up from year to date. Although it has dropped from its all-time high of about $10, the price of WLD has increased significantly since its launch. In other words, for long-term holders, WLD is trading at a significant discount. Whether it makes sense to buy Worldcoin entirely depends on your investment strategy. As stated previously, narratives rule crypto. Worldcoin’s success will depend on whether the project can gain real-world adoption or generate enough hype or controversy to draw the attention of speculators. As always, ensure to prioritize security when interacting with decentralized ecosystems. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Investors can purchase Worldcoin (WLD) on multiple exchanges. These include CoinEx, Binance, OKX, and others. You can also purchase WLD on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). To withdraw Worldcoin in the U.S., you must first find an exchange that supports WLD. Many exchanges do not support WLD in the U.S. You will likely have to purchase the asset on a DEX. Users can purchase Worldcoin on many exchanges. For example, Binance, OKX, and CoinEx support WLD. Users should keep jurisdictional restrictions in mind. To purchase Worldcoin in the U.S., you will most likely have to use a DEX. Many centralized exchanges do not offer WLD. DEXs on Ethereum and Arbitrum may provide a way for users to purchase WLD in the U.S. Yes, users can purchase Worldcoin on Binance. User should keep jurisdictional restrictions in mind. For example, many cryptocurrencies are not available on Binance U.S. When users complete an iris scan with the Worldcoin orb, they will receive free crypto. WLD is not free on CEXs or DEXs. To purchase WLD, you will need to create an account on a CEX or purchase crypto to trade for WLD. Users can earn Worldcoin by completing an iris scan at an official Worldcoin orb. Orbs are available in over 30 countries. To date, there are at least 2,000 orbs available for scanning.

It is important to know the difference as there may be different trust assumptions associated with using one or the other. This guide covers the differences between tokens vs. coins and highlights recommended platforms for purchasing each. BeInCrypto chose the top platforms to purchase coins and tokens was thorough and conducted over a period of six months. Our criteria for the best platforms were safety, fees, availability, reputation, features, and assets offered. Many were considered, however, the platforms that scored the highest are: Here’s some insight into why each was selected. Coinbase As the most popular U.S based crypto brokerage and exchange, and perhaps second most popular exchange globally, Coinbase is one of the top options for purchasing cryptocurrency. The company is known for its adherence to compliance, which gives it a large degree of safety. Kraken Kraken is well known for its advanced trading features, user interface, and derivatives offerings. The exchange also has earning features which allows it to be more than just a simple trading platform. The highly secure CEX also offers NFT, margin and futures trading. eToro As a social trading platform, eToro allows users to copy trade successful traders. They can also enjoy other features outside of crypto, such as stocks and options. The app also supplies users with news, market insights, and advanced charts for more experienced traders. Binance As the largest exchange by trading volume, Binance is the preferred exchange for deep liquidity in many markets. The exchange also has an ultra low trading fee of 0.1%. Binance is considered an all-in-one exchange, as it has multiple features for many types of crypto activities. YouHodler YouHolder is an E.U. based exchange that serves customers in multiple regions. It is perhaps known for its earning features which allows customers to deposit crypto and earn interest in return. Users can also take out loans using crypto as collateral on YouHodler. This methodology was peer-reviewed and fact checked to ensure accuracy. To learn more about BeInCrypto’s Verification Process, click the following link. In cryptocurrency, coins are digital assets native to a blockchain. Put another way, they are assets built into the blockchain itself rather than on top of the blockchain. We can think of this in terms of nations. The native currency for the United States is the United States Dollar (USD), the British Pound Sterling (GBP) for the United Kingdom, and the Euro (EURO) for the Eurozone. Similarly, the native cryptocurrency for the Bitcoin blockchain is Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) for Ethereum, and Solana (SOL) for the Solana blockchain. Let’s take this further. The U.S. Department of the Treasury issues seven denominations of paper currency ($1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100) and five denominations of coins (1¢, 5¢, 10¢, 25¢, 50¢). In the same way, cryptocurrency coins have several denominations as well. There are two popular methods for creating a blockchain’s native coins — UTXO (unspent transaction output) and the account model. While cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Litecoin use the UTXO model, other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and the BNB chain use the account model. A UTXO is created when a transaction occurs. When miners mine a block, they make a Coinbase or a transaction to pay themselves for updating the blockchain. A coinbase transaction is the first transaction in a block a miner creates. When a transaction output is created, it becomes a UTXO until it is spent. Each UTXO contains information about its value (e.g., how many coins it represents). Once created, the outputs can only be used once as input in a new transaction. Two types of record-keeping models are popular in today’s blockchain networks. The first method is the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) Model and the second one is the Account/Balance Model. The UTXO model is employed by Bitcoin, and Ethereum uses the Account/Balance Model. pic.twitter.com/HEEzlMViVF This is similar to a transaction made in coins or bills. A UTXO is like a coin or bill itself, while the bill’s value can vary, similar to how the value of a UTXO can vary. Once spent, you can not retrieve the bill you used to pay once, just like UTXOs can only be used once. The buyer receives any change left over from the transaction. Another UTXO is created and sent to the recipient when a UTXO is spent. If the original UTXO exceeds the amount sent, a second UTXO is made, and the sender receives the remainder via a change address. Each UTXO must reference a previous UTXO as its input, except for special cases like coinbase transactions where new coins are minted. This creates a chain of custody from one UTXO to another based on the history of transactions. You can trace a UTXO back to the transaction where it was created as an output. While the UTXO model records transactions in a way that is similar to transacting with bills and coins, the account model is similar to traditional banking. In this model, accounts hold balances that increase or decrease with each transaction. When you send a transaction, the blockchain directly adjusts the accounts’ balances. It also debits the amount from the sender’s account and credits the same amount to the recipient. As a result, the coins technically are not “sent.” Rather, there is a ledger that updates with each transaction. Another important detail to keep in mind is the account nonce. The account nonce is simply an index of the number of successful transactions of a single account. It ensures that transactions from a single account are processed in the order they are sent. This is important for maintaining the state consistency of the account, such as the balance of Ether. The term nonce (number used once) is used quite frequently in crypto and tech-related fields. “Account nonces” have a separate purpose from nonces in blockchain mining, message authentication codes (MAC), and other systems. Blockchains are distributed databases requiring a network of nodes to maintain all the data it stores. The nodes are computers or servers maintained by individuals or organizations. However, keeping these databases comes at a cost. Unlike Amazon Web Service or Microsoft Azure, the database (or blockchain) nodes are anonymous and distributed globally. Therefore, paying these node operators for their work in a fiat currency is impossible. When a block is created, the node that mines or proposes the block receives a coinbase or a stipend for maintaining this distributed database. Another reason that coins exist is to pay gas and transaction fees. When you create a transaction on a blockchain, a node must pick up your transaction and expend resources to execute it. A transaction fee is paid to the miner or proposer (validator) that executes the transaction. Alternatively, gas fees are the cost to execute the transaction, and transaction fees are the cost to pay the miner or validator to execute the transaction. Users pay both transaction and gas fees in coins. 1. Bitcoin (BTC): Created by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency. While Bitcoin was designed as a medium of exchange, it has since found a stronger use as a store of value. 2. Ether (ETH): Ether is the native cryptocurrency to the Ethereum blockchain. It is used as gas for the Ethereum virtual machine, which allows developers to create applications with some level of complexity. 3. Solana (SOL): As the native coin of the Solana network, SOL is used as payment for gas and transaction fees — which are extremely low on Solana. The smallest unit of SOL is a Lamport, named after Leslie Lamport. 4. Avalanche (AVAX): Avalanche is a layer-0 protocol that uses the AVAX coin as its native crypto. On Avalanche, users can launch subnets using their own nodes. 5. Cosmos (ATOM): Cosmos is a hub allowing founders to create blockchains using the IBC. This enables blockchains to communicate, share information, and transfer assets like ATOM securely and standardized. Unlike coins, developers do not build cryptocurrency tokens directly into the blockchain. Instead, they create tokens as cryptocurrencies using smart contracts on a blockchain. The logic for what “qualifies” as a token and governs its behavior depends entirely on the developer that creates it. With most blockchains today, the network does not recognize the tokens built on it. A few blockchains like Sui and Aptos offer rare exceptions to this rule. As such, some communities have developed token standards specific to their blockchain ecosystem. Token standards govern how accounts are updated. Some of the logic that they manage includes: Perhaps the most popular token standard is the ERC-20 standard for the Ethereum ecosystem and EVM-compatible chains. There is also the BEP-20 standard for the BNB chain, SPL (Solana Program Library) for Solana, and, more recently, the BRC-20 standard for Bitcoin. The concept of tokens is not specific to cryptocurrency. Many examples of tokens exist in the real world. In this case, a token is just a physical representation of some right or privilege. For example, you could consider the deed to a house or the title to a car as a token or proof of ownership of those assets. Tokenization is the digital representation of rights and privileges. In the case of tokens created by smart contracts, the token represents the right to transact value. Aside from the standard logic, tokens work in many different ways. Founders typically create tokens with a purpose in mind and will tailor their behavior to the decentralized application (DApp) or ecosystem in which it will operate. Many have attempted to create frameworks for classifying token logic. This is quite the herculean feat, considering that they are as diverse as the developer is imaginative. In the case of ERC-20 tokens, the logic for the token exists completely within the smart contract. So technically, addresses on Ethereum do not actually “hold” tokens. Rather, the smart contract is like a ledger for an accountant. It keeps a record of the balances of each address that owns tokens. When someone “sends” tokens to another address, the smart contract updates the balance of both addresses. That is why it is important to create tokens using well-tested standards and best practices. Unless developers are careful, a hacker could game poorly formed token logic. As stated previously, many have attempted to create standards for classifying tokens. This is difficult, considering tokens gain new use cases every year. The most popular uses for tokens are: 1. Chainlink (LINK): Chainlink is most notably known for its blockchain-agnostic oracle services. The team behind Chainlink also creates infrastructure for cross-chain communication, bridging, verifiable randomness, and more. 2. The Graph (GRT): Often described as the Google of web3, The Graph is a protocol for indexing information stored on the blockchain. It allows users to query, publish, and use public data to build applications. GRT: The Graph: The Graph is a decentralized protocol that allows developers to index, query, and access blockchain data in a scalable and efficient manner. $PIXIZ | $BAMA | #Bitbama | #R2E. 3. Render (RNDR): Render is a project that allows users to transact in a GPU marketplace. Sellers can rent out their GPU power while buyers utilize it for graphic rendering tasks. 4. Uniswap (UNI): Uniswap is Ethereum’s most popular decentralized exchange (DEX). The UNI token gives its holders governance rights over the protocol. 5. Gala (GALA): Gala Games is a blockchain-based gaming platform that lets players own, develop, and trade in-game assets with cryptocurrency. Here’s a comparison chart that outlines the key differences between crypto coins and tokens. This chart helps to delineate the differences between crypto coins and tokens, portraying how they are used, where they operate, and their characteristics in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. You can compare coins and tokens to currency in traditional finance (TradFi) in many ways. From an accounting perspective, the ledger that records and issues the currency is centralized in trades, decentralized with coins, and depends on tokens. In traditional finance, there are different forms of money because of the system’s complexity. For example, USD can come in bank deposits, fiat (e.g., bills and coins), treasuries (e.g., bonds, notes, etc.), and central bank notes. “When most people think of money, they picture rectangular pieces of government-printed paper, known as fiat currency, decorated with historical figures. Although it is the most well-known form of money, it is only a small part of what constitutes money in the modern financial system.” This complexity complicates the ledger; however, at the end of the day, the system is mostly centralized under the U.S. government. On the other hand, coins built on blockchains are part of a decentralized ledger that is maintained by a global community. In the case of USD, the U.S. government can sanction any country to prevent it from using dollars. With a blockchain, anyone has the right to update the ledger (mint more coins), but no one can exclude anyone else from doing so or transacting. However, tokens do not necessarily have this ability. It all depends on the smart contract itself. Despite the name, stablecoins are primarily tokens. Developers create stablecoins on vetted and seasoned blockchains. This makes them tokens. The reason is that mature blockchains already have the infrastructure for users to utilize stablecoins. If stablecoin providers had to build their blockchains to issue coins, they would also have to find a way to attract developers to build apps on their blockchain or the applications themselves. Both of these options are extremely costly. There could also be significant ramifications if these providers built their own blockchains and bridged the stablecoins to other ecosystems. This comparison between crypto coins and tokens highlights substantial differences between asset types. You must thoroughly research and understand these distinctions for safe trading practices. Staying well-informed will empower you to navigate the cryptocurrency sector safely and effectively. Coins are cryptocurrencies that have their blockchain. Tokens are built on blockchains but do not have their own. They are simply smart contracts that exist outside of the source code of a blockchain. Ethereum is a blockchain. The native coin of Ethereum is Ether. Though many cryptocurrencies exist on Ethereum, their logic is not built into the source code of Ethereum. Tokens are useful for utilizing services on decentralized applications (DApps). For example, traders can not use native Ether in many applications on Ethereum. They must use Wrapped Ether (WETH), a tokenized (smart contract) version of Ether. There are many different classifications for tokens. Utility, governance, security, non-fungible, and transactional are the most common. Tokens are often difficult to classify because their uses and purposes grow with time. Tokens are not a phenomenon specific to cryptocurrency. They also exist in the traditional world. For example, a deed to a house or car title could be considered a token. Examples of tokens include Chainlink (LINK), the Graph (GRT), and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Nearly all stablecoins and most meme coins are also tokens, except Dogecoin. Cryptocurrencies like ETH, BTC, and AVAX are not tokens because their logic is built into the blockchain. However, wrapped versions of these tokens (e.g., WETH, WBTC, and WAVAX) are considered tokens.

Render is a platform that enables users to lend the unused GPU capacity of their home devices to support projects in rendering motion graphics and visual effects. In return, contributors receive Render tokens (RNDR), the native utility crypto of the Render Network. Render allows individuals to access underutilized computational resources affordably and efficiently by establishing a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. This approach streamlines the traditional methods of rendering and streaming 3D environments and other visual effects. “The main reason why Render token has exploded is because of its AI and GPU/ Nvidia’s narratives. The partnership with Apple also gives credibility and opens up a huge market opportunity for RNDR to showcase its technological edge over competitors.” Next-generation media production presents a significant challenge due to the substantial computing power it demands. Although powerful, today’s centralized GPU clouds must meet these growing requirements. I have a soloshow in just few days during Frieze nyc, and @rendernetwork once again saving my ass with their cloud rendering, thank you. Consequently, artists and creators frequently face a competitive scramble for GPU resources. These resources are crucial for traditional rendering cloud streaming and training AI models. This competition leads to a need for more available computing power and drives up costs, making it expensive for many artists. The need for more powerful rendering will grow as technology advances, especially with augmented and mixed-reality content. This demand intensifies existing shortages in computing resources. The crypto mining industry consumes vast GPU resources, yielding diminishing returns as rising energy costs outpace mining profits. This issue has grown more pronounced with the adoption of more energy-efficient blockchain technologies like proof-of-stake. ❐ key challenges The Render Network addresses three key challenges faced by its users: ‣ Scalability A primary advantage of $RNDR lies in its ability to provide a scalable GPU rendering network that can expand to accommodate user needs. Render Network proposes a potentially transformative solution in response to these challenges. It capitalizes on the underutilized GPU cycles by creating a decentralized network that connects content creators with GPU providers. The network enables creators needing additional computational power to access others’ idle GPU resources to render tasks. The Render Network simplifies the complex process of rendering and streaming detailed virtual creations. It alleviates the load on individual GPUs and reduces the overall demand on centralized resources by distributing GPU-based rendering jobs across a peer-to-peer network. This system makes rendering processes quicker and less costly for creators and allows GPU owners to monetize idle capacities. Render Network’s reach extends far beyond just rendering solutions. It offers a platform for various applications, from crowdsourcing 3D projects to managing digital rights. This creates an exciting new marketplace where digital ideas, assets, and applications can be funded and leveraged by anyone — from individual developers and artists to large studios. This, in turn, encourages innovation and collaboration among stakeholders. Render Network was founded in 2017 by Jules Urbach, the CEO of OTOY Inc. OTOY specializes in content creation and rendering software and technology, such as the OctaneRender. Urbach’s vision for the Render Network stemmed from his experiences and challenges within the graphics industry around the high costs and technological barriers that small creators face when accessing advanced rendering capabilities. Render Network is based in the Cayman Islands and is led by Tristan Relly, Head of Operations, and Andrew Hyde, Head of Communications. The core team behind Render Network comprises experts from both the tech and creative industries. The Render Network architecture includes a dual-layered system designed to streamline the rendering process using decentralized computing power. Here’s a quick look at its main components: The first layer of the Render Network architecture is the off-chain rendering network. This layer primarily consists of: A core network infrastructure comprising multiple servers facilitates the interaction between Creators and Node Operators. This setup ensures the efficient management of data exchange and task allocation across the network. This, in turn, helps maintain a smooth operational flow without central oversight. The second layer of the Render Network architecture revolves around blockchain technology, which handles financial transactions and ensures transparency: A key component in the Render Network’s operational model is the integration of OctaneBench. This tool benchmarks a GPU’s rendering performance using a metric called OctaneBench Points per Hour (OBh). This measurement is critical because it directly influences the cost of rendering tasks. OctaneBench ensures that pricing is fair based on the computational power of standardizing GPU performance. The platform dynamically calculates the pricing of tasks using a Multi-Tier Pricing (MTP) algorithm. This algorithm adjusts the cost based on the rendering task’s complexity and the GPU’s performance as measured by OctaneBench. This setup ensures that Creators can anticipate and control their rendering expenses based on predictable performance metrics. Render Network cuts through the noise with features that empower creators and GPU providers. Here’s what makes it a potential game-changer: RNDR functions primarily as a utility token, enabling the core operations of the Render Network. It facilitates transactions within the network, where content creators pay for rendering services using RNDR. This method simplifies the exchange process, directly linking the demand for rendering power with the supply provided by GPU operators. Currently, the network offers different tiers of service — Tier 1 (Trusted Partners), Tier 2 (Priority) and Tier 3 (Economy). Each tier is designed to cater to various speed, security, and price needs, offering flexibility to content creators depending on their specific project requirements and budget constraints. RNDR also serves as a reward mechanism for Node Operators, the GPU providers within the network. These operators can utilize their idle GPU resources to fulfill rendering jobs in exchange for RNDR tokens. Additionally, RNDR also acts as a governance token. It grants holders the power to influence the decision-making processes within the Render Network. This governance role empowers token holders to vote on key proposals that shape the network’s future, including protocol upgrades and policy changes. As of April 30, 2024, the RNDR token has a max supply of 536,870,912. Additionally, with more than 532 million tokens currently in circulation and a market capitalization of over $3.2 billion. The distribution of these tokens is strategically allocated to support various aspects of the network’s growth and sustainability: This allocation strategy aims to ensure the long-term development and scalability of the Render Network. The Render Network and its RNDR token are revolutionizing the digital content creation by providing decentralized rendering solutions and a utility token system for transactions. Here are some real-life applications of Render Network and the RNDR token: Render Network offers ample GPU resources that are ideal for creating high-quality graphics in films and games. Notably, artist Raoul Marks utilized the network to render the opening titles of “Westworld Season 4,” showcasing its capacity to support complex artistic projects. Render Network has expanded its activities in AI and machine learning. The platform provides computational resources for AI-generated graphics and prototypes, allowing cost-effective rendering of high-quality images for AI applications. “Generative AI on the inference and training side also fit to the kinds of GPUs that are already on Render. You don’t need an H100 to do training on generative video. One of the more exciting propositions for us is we look at the Apple ecosystem where you have GPUs with 120 gigabytes of video memory, those are out there in the tens of millions. Tapping into that is going to be a massive win over the cost of the scaling issues we have on centralized clouds. That’s where I see huge advantages of decentralized approaches like we have.” Render Network can come in handy for architects and product designers to produce high-quality 3D visualizations and virtual reality renders. It facilitates large-scale prototyping and detailed design analysis, which can improve design accuracy and presentation. RNDR is the primary currency for transactions within Render Network, where creators pay for GPU power to render graphics. Additionally, the network offers RNDR credits purchasable via bank cards, simplifying the payment process for crypto newbies. The Burn and Mint Equilibrium (BME) model enhances RNDR’s value by adjusting its supply based on network demand. Creators burn RNDR tokens to fund rendering jobs, ensuring ongoing demand. Node Operators earn these tokens as rewards, creating a dynamic economic ecosystem within the network. RNDR has shown a continued uptrend in its performance over extended periods, including gains year-on-year since its inception. This direction, alongside projections of growth in the rendering industry over the next decade, suggests a bright future for RNDR. However, like all crypto investments, risks due to market volatility and evolving regulations exist. To make an informed decision, thoroughly researching industry trends, guides, and potential risks is crucial. Understanding the opportunities and challenges can lead to more informed investment decisions for Render. Determining whether RNDR is a good investment depends on your individual risk tolerance, market conditions, and the overall performance of the cryptocurrency sector. Like all investments, RNDR carries risks, particularly due to the volatility of the crypto market. That said, the RNDR price has shown consistency over the long haul. For instance, it has increased more than 21,000% since launch and more than 350% year-on-year. Render is a platform that enables users to lend the unused GPU capacity of their home devices to support projects in rendering motion graphics and visual effects.

Undeads Metaverse aims to become a breakout star and address the so-far unfulfilled promises of NFTs and the metaverse in the digital entertainment sector. This guide covers everything you need to know about the Undeads blockchain survival game and its encompassing ecosystem. Here’s what to know. Undeads is a play-to-earn online MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role-playing game). Set in a post-apocalyptic metaverse, the combat-oriented survival game opens with humans and zombies engaged in conflict. The online role-playing game offers a wide range of revenue-generating features. It is powered by in-game NFTs and operates on the Ethereum blockchain. In this world there are two main factions: humans and zombies. Players can also discover new areas, defend and grow their settlements, gather resources, craft and upgrade equipment, trade, pick a career, and grow their dynamic NFT character. Leo Kahn, formerly the Senior Director of Paypal’s crypto division, is the Undeads CEO. Kahn has 18 years of professional experience working for startups and Fortune 10 companies. He has also raised over $300 million and has extensive experience as a C-level executive. Ash Hodgetts is the Chief Marketing Officer. He was responsible for the success of Phantom Galaxies, another blockchain-based game. Ash has over 20 years of traditional video game marketing and development experience and has worked with large license holders including MLB and Disney. Some of the key members of the Undeads team are: As previously inferred, players can select between the Zombie and Human factions of the game, both of which are NFT assets. Humans can build, obtain professions, and craft weapons and other items. Zombies, however, drain resources from Humans and strengthen their ranks through breeding. The game is open-world, and players live by grinding for materials and manufacturing goods. You can protect your assets in player-vs-player (PvP) and player-vs-everyone (PvE) modes. Players can also become metaverse entrepreneurs by constructing residential, industrial, and commercial structures. Furthermore, the Undeads universe features a player-driven economy where users can own, buy, sell, trade, and acquire trophies redeemed for actual ETH through gameplay and various other tasks. 🌎The first detailed and large location of the Undeads world map has been designed and generated 🏠Hundreds of buildings, including enterable ones 🌴Trees & forests 🛣Dozens miles of roads 🚘Cars ✅And thousands of various handcrafted objects, animations and decorations… pic.twitter.com/WIeKdH2Hdr Beyond the combat-based game mechanics and land plots, the Undeads Metaverse offers many in-game items such as Mystery Boxes, Potions, Antidotes, and other NFT collections. Before the game begins, players can obtain an NFT box containing items they can use in the game. These boxes contain several perks, such as melee and ranged weapons, armor, and the ability to unlock specific professions (such as medic, soldier, etc.). Each box includes one main item and three bonus items. The types of boxes include: The game experience begins with the acquisition of Mystery Boxes, which contain five various sorts of potions. If a Mystery Box hasn’t been unboxed, a player can sell or swap among themselves. Alternatively, purchase a Legendary Box, and you will receive a fifth-grade potion containing one of 11 unique in-game NFTs with advanced stats, damage, and luck coefficients. Legendaries will have distinct special skills that provide them an advantage over other players. A potion allows any player to mint a random NFT Zombie. Depending on the grade of the potion, players can mint zombies ranging from common to first grade exceedingly rare Legendary Zombies. These offer unique in-game features, skills, and expensive weapons. There are five grades of potion: With 6666 Zombies and 6666 Humans to choose from, Undeads gamers are spoiled for choice. Each NFT has its own set of skills and appearances. The game also includes a variety of NFTs as playable characters, which will be available after the game is fully released. The Undeads NFT collection is set to strengthen the Undeads ecology by featuring stunning 3D graphics and fully playable in-game characters. Powered by Dynamic NFTs, they can be used to change player scores, in-game item levels, and durability. The antidote is an NFT that grants players access to a playable character from the Human faction. There are two kinds of antidotes: The first type of antidote is available free of charge to Zombie NFT holders through the Mystery Box Collection. Each Zombie can get one NFT Antidote. There will be 6666 total of this type of antidote. Players can acquire a character from the human faction in the following grades: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, or Legendary. If players decide not to utilize their NFT, they can sell it on the Undeads marketplace. The second sort of antidote is available during the Public Sale for ETH. There will also be 6666. This set will only offer Common, Uncommon, Rare, and Epic grades. The Undeads marketplace allows players to trade their items, ensuring quick and safe NFT transactions. Players can visit the marketplace to look for items for their characters. With each transaction, players launch personal trade smart contracts, shielding both the buyer and the seller from the dangers associated with trading. Another important feature of the Undead marketplace is the exclusive use of UDS tokens for transactions. This will help to sustain UDS demand and prop up the strength of the Undead economy. Additionally, all transactions in the marketplace will pay a percentage charge to the Community Treasury. The Undeads game is powered by two tokens: UDS and UGOLD. UDS is the governance token, and UGOLD is the in-game currency. Players must acquire the UDS token to unlock important in-game features, join the DAO, and vote on future gameplay developments and updates. As use increases, so does the need for UDS tokens.

However, BeInCrypto is not responsible for any personal financial loss or gain incurred based on our content.  To learn more on how we evaluate each piece of content, please proceed to our verification methodology page As traders navigate the fluctuations between bullish and bearish forces in the crypto market, they often use indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and volume analysis to time their trades. However, in an unpredictable field, it is useful to have a tool that analyzes the behavioral phases of crypto trading instead of the price and trend confirmations. This is where the Gator Oscillator comes in handy. This guide dives into the Gator Oscillator, examining its practical applications, calculation method, and analytical benefits. Here’s why it’s an essential oscillator for those seeking precise trading signals without the overload of multiple indicators. The Gator Indicator, also termed the Gator Oscillator, is a derivative or a sourced version of the famous Alligator Indicator. While the alligator indicator is made of moving averages, the Gator Oscillator is made of histograms. This tool helps users visualize and interpret the market’s behavior, helping them make sense of the various phases leading to or following a trend. Did you know? The Gator Oscillator was created by Bill Williams, a 1932-born trader who also created the trend-following Alligator Indicator, the Market Facilitation Index (MFI), and price pattern-evaluating Fractals. The Gator Oscillator relies on histogram analysis and features two histograms to work with. The histograms above the zero line and below the zero line can be all red, all green, or a mix of both, depending on the state of the market or the cryptocurrency you are analyzing. The Gator Oscillator is a simplified version of the Alligator indicator. The former doesn’t directly identify the trend’s direction but only captures the mood. It helps the traders make sense of market phases by dividing moves into the sleeping, awakening, eating, and weakening phases. These phases, when viewed in combination with the Alligator Indicator’s moving averages and the price action, help you with decision-making and even risk management. The idea is to look for the histogram analysis patterns to turn green and red from all red before you can consider entering a long position. The risk management element is taken care of when you start closing your open position, and all the green bars turn green and red, hinting at a sating phase. The Gator Oscillator is still a lagging indicator, showcasing the trend’s strength rather than the direction unless you use it to analyze the trading divergence. The calculation principle of the Gator Oscillator is based on how the Alligator Indicator moves. Therefore, it is necessary first to understand the elements of the latter: Note: These are the lines and moving average levels set by Bill Williams. The TradingView Gator Oscillator settings, like any other TradingView Indicator, could have slightly different values for the moving average. Notice how in the above TradingView Gator Oscillator and Alligator Indicator representation, the 5-period line is green, and the 13-period Jawline is red. In this case, the teeth are the blue line and smoothed as 9-period instead of 8-period of showcase mid-term trends instead of short-term. Each moving average is shifted forward by 8-period, 5-period, and 3-period to reduce the effects of the lagging indicator and make the Gator indicator more forward-looking. Now that the base is all set, let us focus on the calculation: As mentioned earlier, the Gator Oscillator comprises dual histograms comprising upper and lower bars. Each upper bar is the absolute difference between the 13-period and 8-period/9-period smoothed averages. Each lower bar is the difference between the 8-period/9-period and 5-period moving averages. The bars can be green and red, depending on the nature of the trend. We shall look into this while reading a gator oscillator. Reading the Gator Oscillator is all about understanding the elements. Notably, while this oscillator helps with the entry and exit points, it can signal the trend direction, provided you know how to read the trading divergence. The easiest way to read is to understand the phases of the Gator Oscillator, along with the colors. If both the histogram bars are red, expect the price action to be in the sleeping phase. This shows the market is in a consolidation phase, not rife for entry. If one histogram is in green and the other is in red, or are there multiple green-red bars, you might be looking at the awakening phase. This might reveal clear entry points and the potential start of a forming up trend. If both the histogram bars are green, expect the market to be in the eating phase. This is where traders take most of the profit, capitalizing on the momentum. When, after the eating phase, the bars again start showing mixed colors — red and green, you can expect the trend to lose momentum. This is where most traders exit positions and book profits. The size of the bars also reveals a lot in terms of price action. For instance, if the green and red bars in the awakening phase are smaller than the sleeping phase, you might want to look at other indicators and wait for a different entry point. If the price action and the formation of bars (bar size even) move in different directions, you might be looking at trading divergence. For instance, check the chart below. Despite the formation of red and green histogram bars, the price of BTC corrected instead of rising, as the bars were smallish and not aligned with the price action. Important: If the bars in the awakening zone are smaller than the ones encountered in the previous phase, the trend is not solid, and the price action might trade sideways for a while. Now that we know how to read this indicator, let’s take the BTC price chart and try to use the Gator Oscillator in real-time crypto trading. We shall now look at the historical chart of Bitcoin, starting in 2021 and following all the way till the peak formed towards the end of that year. The first encircled zone hints at a consolidation or sleeping phase with all-red, smallish bars. Then came the awakening phase with the broadening green bars and occasional red here and there. After this came the price surge, taking BTC to a new high of almost $58,000. Immediately after this high, the Gator indicator started showing green and red bars, hinting a correction and space for traders to exit the trade. The entire short-term journey is depicted by the A to D pathway. Note that these phases were between January and February 2021, and BTC embarked on several such journeys to reach a peak of almost $69,000 by the end of the year. In 2024, the price of BTC seems to be trading in the sleeping zone, slowly transitioning to the awakening zone. Yet, it is noticeable that the bars in the awakening zone aren’t as big as the ones in the last sated phase. This shows that BTC might keep moving in a range for now, making short-term highs and lows only from the trading perspective. Notice how the weekly BTC chart reveals a more accurate formation of the Gator Oscillator. The ellipse highlighting the oscillator’s specific zone reveals the eating zone, after which the sated zone arrives quickly with sizeable green and red bars. Based on the historical analysis, we expect the price action to be muted for a while before BTC enters the sleeping zone. After that, we need to look for the color and size of the bars, per the histogram analysis, to locate the next leg of the trend. However, besides the technical analysis, broader crypto market sentiments also plays a key role in determining BTC’s price action. “Technical analysis is massively important and should not be ignored. Sentiment is a great way to gauge markets too, and news does move the market in unexpected ways sometimes. But more often than not we can at least get some early indications in the charts. I.e, Bitcoin at 73k saw seven months of green candles, a near historic run, a correction was coming if you could think without greed and euphoria clouding your mind. A MACD bear cross came the day after hitting the high; an early warning sign of trouble to come. But while this was happening the market was wildly euphoric, Blackrock ETF buyers bought a billion that day. So, yes, sentiment is important but it works as a counter indicator. Try to think against the herd.” The Gator Oscillator is best read with the Alligator Indicator. This means it is imperative to locate the oscillator’s awakening phase when the Alligator Indicator’s moving averages start diverging in the following order — 5-period, 8-period/9-period, and 13-period. At its heart, the Alligator Indicator is all about finding the golden crossover patterns in relation to the price action. The Gator Oscillator helps validate these patterns. The Gator Oscillator is a secondary indicator you pair with the Alligator moving averages. The histogram bars take shape depending on the convergence and divergence of the Alligator or the primary indicator. For near-accurate technical analysis, you might want to pair the Gator Oscillator with the following crypto trading indicators: MACD helps locate the potential reversals and trend-based momentum. To use the Gator Oscillator with the MACD indicator, you might want to focus on the convergence and divergence between the two indicators to get the strongest possible trading signals. The Bitcoin price action chart shows the blue line of the MACD threatening to drop under the orange line, hinting at bearishness. The sated phase or zone of the Gator Oscillator validates the MACD-specific finding. Both these indicators suggest that BTC might move in a range or even correct a little in the short-to-mid-term. The relative strength indicator measures the price change and speed of price action, eventually helping to determine oversold and overbought market conditions. Using it with the gator oscillator is simple. You need to locate an RSI divergence, bullish or bearish, and analyze it with the existing zone of the oscillator is in. Besides these indicators, crypto traders must value fundamental analysis for long-term wealth creation. The most successful people in the financial world like Buffet, Dalio, Soros, Marks and Lynch are not day traders and don't use technical analysis. That stuff works, but not for most people and it's not the optimal way to get rich from #crypto. Fundamental analysis is 😘 And… If you want to use the Gator Oscillator to transform your trading performance, here are the best strategies to follow: Even though the Gator Oscillator is a powerful trading tool that helps you identify the sentiment of the trading crowd — calm, excited, or somewhere in the middle — it is best paired with other trading indicators, especially trend-confirming ones like RSI. Additionally, it’s important to note that the Gator Oscillator indicator works best across a longer timeframe. This means it works best with more established/mature cryptocurrencies with discernable historical data to analyze. Trading with the Gator Oscillator requires you to choose a longer time frame, say weekly. Once you have the weekly chart, look for a phase when the histogram analysis, relative to the mid-line of the histogram, showcases big, red-green bars after a smallish all-red bar phase. This is termed the awakening phase, when most traders enter long positions. The Alligator strategy does offer reliable trading signals. When paired with the price action, this is one of the trading indicators that uses short-term moving averages for technical analysis. Alligator strategy works well in crypto market analysis as you capture the asset’s volatility without relying on multiple trading indicators. The Alligator pattern in crypto trading corresponds to the multiple behavioral phases of the alligator — sleeping, waking, eating, and sating — to analyze the inclination of traders. Trading oscillators like the Gator Oscillator are formed using the alligator pattern and are useful for helping traders locate the best times to enter and exit crypto trading positions. Reading a Gator indicator is easy. Use histogram analysis, keeping the middle or zero lines as a reference. If the bars on both sides of the middle line are red, the price action or trend is expected to be sleeping. You might wish to enter trades if the bars turn green and red. However, it is important to note that the bar size during the awakening or trade-entering phase shouldn’t be smaller than the sleeping phase. After that comes a phase where all bars are green, relevant to the middle line. This is where you, as a trader, can book most profits. You should exit trades before the histogram bars again turn red-green.

Polkadot launched in 2020, aiming to develop a network of blockchain platforms akin to Ethereum. It features a main chain known as the relay chain and several parallel chains or parachains. Developers build these parachains on top of the Polkadot protocol. Each operates with its own rules and policies, essentially functioning as independent decentralized applications (DApps). Polkadot operates on a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus method, requiring users to stake or lock in their assets to participate. This enhances network security and allows users to earn interest as a reward for their involvement. First, I have to explain to you step by step the current system so you can understand where I'm going ➡️ Polkadot has a relay chain or 'main chain' which provides security, consensus, and interoperability to the parachains connected to it 🔌. To obtain all these advantages of… pic.twitter.com/8kRsmdUH06 The parachains handle and process the transactions, which are sent to the relay chain for final validation. This two-step process reduces congestion on the relay chain, enabling Polkadot to scale efficiently and process more than 1000 transactions per second. DOT, the native cryptocurrency of the Polkadot network, is essential for governance, staking, and bonding parachains, highlighting its fundamental role within the Polkadot ecosystem. By bonding parachains through DOT, users help to secure new chains to the Polkadot network, further promoting an interconnected crypto community. As of May 1, 2024, the price of Polkadot is $6.78 as per CoinMarketCap data, with a market cap of $9,754,511,094. The coin reached its all-time high of $55.00 on Nov. 4, 2021. Choosing the best wallet to store DOT involves considering various factors to ensure your crypto assets’ security and functionality. Additionally, it’s important to learn how to properly set up a crypto wallet to ensure your assets remain secure. When selecting a wallet, assess ease of use and security measures. Here are some pointers to include in your decision-making and investment process: Ultimately, the best Polkadot wallet depends on your specific needs, and it’s important to consider your own personal requirements before making your choice. For example, eToro Wallet offers access to traditional stocks as well as crypto. OKX Wallet supports DOT while offering a gateway to web3. With YouHodler Wallet, users can engage in lending and other DeFi services. Ledger is a top hardware wallet option for long-term HODLers, while Coinbase Wallet is the perfect entry point for those new to crypto. Always DYOR, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. DOT is the native coin of the Polkadot network, specifically designed for governance, staking, and bonding to facilitate the connection of parachains. This crypto enables unique functionalities within the Polkadot ecosystem, enhancing interoperability and scalability. Before investing in Polkadot, you should consider your investment goals and risk tolerance. The network’s innovative multi-chain architecture may provide long-term growth potential. However, investing in any crypto carries inherent risks. Remember to assess the current market dynamics and do your own research beforehand.

However, BeInCrypto is not responsible for any personal financial loss or gain incurred based on our content.  To learn more on how we evaluate each piece of content, please proceed to our verification methodology page If you want to get ahead of trends in the crypto space, try out the ZigZag indicator. While other trend-following crypto trading indicators for technical analysis include the Moving Average Convergence Divergence and the Parabolic SAR, the ZigZag indicator stands out for its simplistic approach in helping you identify swing highs and lows. This guide explores everything about the ZigZag Indicator, including its ability to spot potential bullish and bearish signals, usefulness across multiple timeframes, and best practices. The ZigZag pattern in crypto identifies and visualizes a clear pivot point that easily determines bullish and bearish trends. Notably, the pattern isn’t out-and-out predictive. Instead, it adjusts depending on changing market conditions. The pattern isolates movements that are essential for trend identification and price action monitoring. The ZigZag indicator is a technical analysis resource that can clearly identify swing highs and lows using straight lines. This indicator can be paired with the Fibonacci Retracement tool to help locate key support and resistance levels. Here are the basic features of this indicator: Look up "ZigZag" default indicator on TV. Might be handy for volume analysis as it calculates cumulative vol of each swings. I don't use vol for my index trades, but this could be useful for stocks swing trading on HTF pic.twitter.com/uoYXTNvRAW If you have previously used the Bollinger Bands indicator, you will know the importance of indicator settings. Let us look at what that means for the ZigZag and how the settings help in reading the indicator. The indicator depth signifies the lowest number of bars between the potential low and the potential high. As the name suggests, increasing the depth will result in fewer price-specific fluctuations, with the lines expected to move in one direction for longer. When the line reverses, indicating a reversal, the visualization becomes more significant. The deviation refers to the percentage of the minimum price move needed for the indicator to change course. If the deviation is set high, smaller price moves are flushed out. The depth and deviation settings also determine the minimum number of bars formed between the swing lows and highs, which the Backstep count determines. To calculate or plot the ZigZag indicator, you first need to choose a starting point. Say, for the sake of illustration, this is $67232, per the latest Bitcoin price chart (shown above). Now that we have chosen the deviation to be 10%, the next low would never be considered if the Bitcoin price doesn’t fall by 10% of $67,232. This is why you can see the line from the starting point continuing. Also, it is worth mentioning that the ZigZag is a lagging indicator and only captures the trend. It isn’t predictive in nature. Also, reading this indicator should always be done in tandem with chart patterns, candlestick analysis, Fibonacci retracement levels, and the Elliot Wave formations — all of which we will discuss while exploring trading strategies. Did you know? Candlestick charting, integral to technical analysis, was developed in 18th-century Japan by rice trader Munehisa Homma, who used it to interpret market emotions and investor sentiment. This technique gained global prominence in the 1980s through the works of Steve Nison. As for the best ZigZag indicator setting, you can use the following table as your trial-and-error guide, optimized for scalping, day trading, swing trading, and even long-term investing: At first glance, the ZigZag indicator doesn’t look like much. It is one of the more basic crypto trading indicators that follows price action. However, how you set the depth and deviation determines how strong the trend identification results are. Here are some of the crypto trading strategies that you can execute using the ZigZag indicator, along with the price action, histogram analysis, candlestick patterns, and a few other elements. The idea is simple. Once you apply the ZigZag indicator to the price action, you should look for lower highs during an uptrend and higher lows during a downtrend to identify a possible trend reversal. A historical validation of this strategy surfaced in December 2017, when BTC reached a high of almost $20,000. From that, it dipped all the way to $6000, showcasing significant market volatility. The subsequent swing high and the next swing low formed lower. This suggested a weakening trend and by December 2018, the price of Bitcoin dipped to almost $3000. The ZigZag indicator helps you locate the historical support and resistance levels. Notice how, in the case of BTC, the low made in December 2018 acted as a significant support level, which was respected during other downturns and corrective phases. Also, the prices surged in 2019 all the way up to $14,000 once Bitcoin managed to breach past the crucial resistance levels posed by all the lower high formations in 2018. If you are a trader interested in taking long positions, the ZigZag indicator can help you locate these key levels. Once these key levels are in, you can use them to place stop loss or even take profit orders, per your preferences. The ZigZag Indicator is at the very foundation of the Elliot Wave strategy. If you carefully observe any Elliot Wave pattern, say 1-2-3-4-5, you can see that the waves best align with the ZigZags. Plus, the corrective wave after the 1-5 impulse wave — the A-B-C wave — can also be sourced from the ZigZag indicator as part of the trend identification. Simply put, the ZigZag indicator helps visualize the Elliot Waves better. But then, to use this strategy, you need to understand the conditions/guidelines associated with Elliot Wave formation: Do note that these rules and guidelines aren’t set in stone. Under actual market conditions, there is room for some variation. With the Elliot Wave theory in place, you can even use volume analysis to place buy orders. You can combine the ZigZag swings with Fibonacci levels to locate additional support and resistance levels. The usage is simple — you need first to locate a swing high and then the swing low. Once done, you can connect the levels using the Fib indicator, giving you the possible support levels. Traders can use these support levels to look for breaches, rebounds, and ideal buying levels. Above is a BTC chart featuring the Fib retracement indicator connecting the swing high of $72,797 and the swing low of $59,600. Notice how the Fib indicator revealed a support level of $66838 at 61.8% of the indicator. A breach past this level, followed by a rebound and another breach, would have confirmed a positive move for Bitcoin. Instead, the price action couldn’t cross, nullifying any possible buying opportunity. ZigZag indicators are primarily straight lines. Therefore, you can use them to identify classical chart patterns like double tops, head and shoulders, triangles, and more. Below is a quick chart showing the double top formation at closer to $72,000 both times. This showed BTC bulls lacked strength, leading to a sizable price correction. ZigZag indicators can be used to work with momentum indicators and oscillators to help locate trading divergence. If you see that the bottom of the indicator, or the swing low of the ZigZag, coincides with an RSI peak, you might expect the prices to surge and vice versa. The same holds even when you are using the likes of the Gator Oscillator. Here are the key signals you need to look for while using the ZigZag indicator with the TradingView Gator Oscillator. #Bitcoin – $57,500 should be the bottom or its over ? On the weekly chart, the price is trading below the weekly support zone of $60,000. I see a lot of people calling for $50,000. The problem with this is if the price closes below the blue box, it would make the price action… pic.twitter.com/CQ9M9rNDC3 In addition to the mentioned strategies, you can look for key candlestick formations at the swing highs and swing lows to track potential reversals. Above is a quick example of it showing a “Bullish Harami” candlestick formation coinciding with the swing low for BTC at almost $65,000. The price moved to almost $73,000 within a few trading sessions. Note that besides these trading indicators, you must also rely on project fundamentals. “Fundamentals I’m talking about are quant measures of demand/supply. Anything that’s not TA on a price chart. These can be short timeframes. Includes – order book auction – futures demand via funding – flows into exchanges – open interest – on-chain liquidity shifts” The ZigZag indicator is one of the more reliable crypto trading indicators around. It fixes minor price fluctuations to accurately represent swing highs and lows, making it a powerful tool against the crypto market volatility. Furthermore, it works with most trading oscillators and chart analysis tools across multiple timeframes, making it one of the more flexible crypto trading resources. Overall, ZigZag is relatively accurate and offers bankable signals, making it a useful tool for traders operating in decentralized asset markets. To trade using the ZigZag indicator, you first need to adjust the settings based on your trading preferences, which will then help you smooth out the price action and locate the accurately identified swing highs and lows. Once done, you can apply the indicator for trend identification, getting hold of the bullish and bearish signals. Besides that, this indicator can even help you locate trading signals by presenting the right and usable patterns. The ZigZag trading algorithm represents a systematic method where the indicator is used to identify pivotal price movements. The algorithm works in the backend and filters the price moves, identifies the price reversals, and eventually helps with chart analysis and devise a handful of crypto trading strategies. Even though there is no perfect indicator setting for ZigZag, a good way forward is to go with a 5% deviation and a depth number of 12. These settings work well for day trading and even swing trading amid the crypto market volatility. Options trading is all about determining the buying and selling pressure across the concerned crypto counter. This is why the RSI indicator can be a good tool followed by the likes of Gator Oscillator. On TradingView Gator Oscillator, RSI and price action can be implemented at once to locate the right trading signals. Well, no single indicator can claim to be the most accurate. However, the MACD or Moving Average Convergence Divergence is known to offer clear cut trading signals via histogram analysis.

To learn more on how we evaluate each piece of content, please proceed to our verification methodology page One of the dominant narratives in crypto in 2024 is around ETFs. But why do they matter, and what’s the significance of Hong Kong’s involvement? Find the answers to this and more in this Hong Kong spot crypto ETF deep dive. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are baskets of investments that are designed to mimic the performance of an index or sector. They are similar to mutual funds because they pool investors’ assets and use professional fund managers to invest the money. ETFs are bought and sold on an exchange like any other listed stock. ETFs can hold a variety of asset types, including: ETFs are typically considered low-risk investments because they are low-cost and hold a basket of securities or other assets, which is great for diversification. They also attempt to replicate the performance of a specific market. As a result, many ETFs own the same assets as the index they track. Institutional investors can create additional ETF shares or redeem them for a basket of the underlying assets. This procedure helps to match the ETF’s market price with its net asset value (NAV). If an ETF’s price differs from its NAV, traders can buy or sell the ETF while simultaneously holding opposing positions in the underlying assets or a linked derivative (e.g., futures or options). This arbitrage can help bridge the price gap, ensuring the ETF price closely reflects its intended index. It also enables traders to profit from market inefficiencies. Lastly, in the context of cryptocurrency and Bitcoin ETFs, ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin and crypto without the risk of actually holding the asset. ETF fund managers are subject to rigorous regulations on the custody of the underlying assets. Therefore, they are required to appoint a custodian to hold their underlying assets. The custodian is usually a reputable bank or financial institution. Did you know? Coinbase Custody secures the majority of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. Recently, three fund managers have launched six crypto ETFs in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong branches of mainland Chinese firms Harvest Global Investments, China Asset Management (CAM), and Bosera Asset Management issued the Bitcoin and Ether ETF funds. This move marks a significant development in Bitcoin and Hong Kong’s financial markets. Here’s why Hong Kong spot crypto ETFs matter to the crypto ecosystem. Many traders believed that due to a slew of converging events, with the Hong Kong ETFs being the culmination, the price of Bitcoin would pump tremendously on news of the approval. The start of this chain of events began in Q1 2024 when the U.S. Federal Reserve announced interest rate pauses and potential cuts. We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle and that if the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year. This is traditionally viewed as a bullish event by investors. In other words, many believe that when the U.S. Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, the prices of assets like Bitcoin or equities increase, which is good for investors worldwide. Additionally, with the debut of the U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs (another bullish event for Bitcoin), followed by the Bitcoin halving, prospects were generally optimistic regarding the positive performance of Bitcoin. In summary, many anticipated that the price of Bitcoin would pump because of: In fact, the price impact on BTC was much more tepid than many expected, with trading volumes initially looking lower than was anticipated. The leading crypto asset managed to reclaim $64,000 upon the news of Hong Kong spot ETF approval but has since dipped below $60,000 (accurate as of May. 3, 2024). Much hype around Hong Kong ETFs also centers around their proximity to Asian markets, particularly China — where cryptocurrency was banned in 2017. Note: Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region (SAR) sitting just on the border of China. It has its own judicial, legislative, and executive powers and a separate legal system. With a massive population of 1.4 billion (17.72% of the world’s population) and a transaction volume of $90 billion in just a single month in 2023 on Binance from Chinese traders, Hong Kong ETF inflows from mainland China could prove to be a significant value-add to Bitcoin’s performance. In total, Asia-based customer exchange volume exceeded 1 trillion dollars in March and April of 2024. Although this may not necessarily translate to ETF trading, it does make a significant case for Asia’s growing interest in crypto. As stated previously, Asia-based exchange crypto trading volume exceeded $1 trillion in late Q1 2024 and early Q2 2024. This overshadows North American markets, which sit between $100-$200 billion in monthly trading volume. As a result, many people believe Hong Kong ETFs will be serious competitors to U.S. markets. This comparison has much to do with the sentiments of how both markets view crypto. While Hong Kong is positioning itself to become a crypto hub, the U.S. has taken the opposite approach, levying a heavy-handed and oftentimes criticized enforcement towards crypto-related activities, businesses, and developers. Notably, the U.S. approved futures-based crypto ETFs before, and at the chagrin, of approving spot-based crypto ETFs. Many believe spot-based ETFs to be superior products to futures ETFs. This is due to roll costs and contango risks. As a result, the U.S. has been criticized for inadvertently putting customers at risk, while Hong Kong has been praised for its progressive policies towards crypto-based financial products. Moreover, while U.S. crypto ETFs have been relegated to cash redemptions, Hong Kong has opted to use in-kind redemptions, which are considered less complex and more cost-efficient than the latter. Despite the hype, the debut of Hong Kong crypto ETFs was relatively lukewarm. The U.S. ETFs achieved $4.6 billion in trading volume on their first day, while Hong Kong produced about $12 million in trading volume. However, this performance is more impressive when contextualized within the regional markets. https://t.co/CCZxCxVbeh Unlike the U.S., where daily trading volumes can reach $166 billion, Asia sees an average of only $20 billion. Specifically, the ChinaAMC Bitcoin ETF’s first-day intake of $123 million is impressive, ranking it 6th among the 82 ETFs launched in Hong Kong over the past three years. We just put out note with final data (which doesn't come in as fast as US). In short, HK saw $292m in assets on Day One (we predicted $1b in two years so way ahead of schedule but corrections can derail trajectories as we seeing in US). Ether ETFs grabbed 15% of pie and size… https://t.co/RT8SvMvEuA The U.S. Bitcoin ETF’s assets under management (AUM) reflect the United States’s status as the world’s financial center and may also reflect a preference for investors to trade ETFs in the U.S. rather than Hong Kong. As of May 3, 2024, the AUM of U.S. crypto ETFs is between $500 million and about $2.5 billion. On the one hand, the U.S. signifies a larger market for institutional players to trade. On the other, Hong Kong presents a more progressive haven for crypto investors. As of 2024, the U.S. has only approved Bitcoin ETFs, while Hong Kong has both Bitcoin and Ether ETFs. Although Asia dominates crypto trading volume, North America dominates ETF trading volume. Comparatively, the ETF markets in the U.S. and Hong Kong also differ in size, variety of offerings, trading behavior, and regulatory frameworks. With almost $50 billion in assets, Hong Kong has a comparatively small market size. Hong Kong’s ETF market has grown but is still smaller than the U.S. Moreover, ETF offerings in Hong Kong have traditionally focused more on Asian markets and specific regional investments. Everyone is saying the Hong Kong #Bitcoin ETFs flamed out, without understanding what actually happened and what the implications are. This is a second major portal to legacy money. A lot of it. Plan accordingly. https://t.co/Wsme7EPiU5 The U.S. ETF market is one of the largest in the world, with assets totaling almost $9 trillion. It offers a wide variety of ETFs, including those covering: Yes, also @EthereanMaximus: There are more assets in US Listed #Bitcoin ETFs than there are assets in EVERY single ETF listed in Hong Kong. Yes it could be a big deal down the line. But its a whole different animal. The US ETF Market is almost $9 Trillion in assets — that's… U.S. ETFs are also known for having a high degree of innovation. The U.S. market features a broad array of ETFs, including thematic ETFs, ESG (environmental, social, and governance) focused ETFs, leveraged and inverse ETFs, and more. In contrast, the focus in Hong Kong has traditionally been more on conventional assets and less on alternative or niche markets. However, recent years have seen an expansion into more specialized products, including those targeting mainland Chinese investors — although mainland China is currently restricted from trading Hong Kong Bitcoin and Ether ETFs. 2024 will go down as the year of crypto ETFs. Many countries are opening up to the idea of crypto-related financial products being a viable investment strategy. The U.S. kicked off the year by approving spot Bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 10, 2024. Despite historical skepticism towards cryptocurrencies, the approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. in January reflects a commendable shift towards embracing innovation. Following the U.S., Hong Kong was next in line to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs for trading. By the end of 2024, the ASX stock exchange in Australia is anticipated to list the first batch of spot bitcoin ETFs that have been approved. Although Australian investors have traded spot bitcoin ETFs on CBOE Australia since 2022, ASX is Australia’s leading equities exchange, handling most domestic trades. In March 2024. the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) of the U.K. announced that it would not object to requests for crypto asset-backed exchange-traded notes. Shortly thereafter, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) disclosed that it would accept applications for crypto ETNs, with a tentative listing date set for May 28, 2024, and only for institutional investors. Although the U.K. listing is a big win for crypto-related financial products, it is important to recognize the distinction between crypto ETFs vs. ETNs and how they differ from North American and Asian markets. European regulations, particularly those under UCITS, require investment funds to be diversified to reduce risk. ETFs can hold a variety of assets to achieve this diversification. However, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether are single assets, so creating a diversified fund solely focused on a single crypto asset is impossible within the UCITS framework. As a result, financial institutions have turned to alternative structures like Exchange-Traded Notes (ETNs) to provide exposure to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. ETNs are debt securities that track the performance of an underlying asset. In this way they are similar to ETFs, except ETNs do not require direct asset ownership. However, LSE-approved crypto ETNs are required to hold the underlying asset, unlike typical ETNs. The year 2024 is shaping up to be one of the most prolific for crypto developments, particularly in the area of institutional adoption. Whereas in previous cycles, success was characterized by massive startup valuations, froth, and huge profits, this cycle is categorized by a shift towards legitimacy and validation, as major players in finance embrace digital assets. The significance of Hong Kong spot crypto ETFs is most clearly that they are another step towards global recognition and integration of digital assets into traditional financial systems. Yes, on April 30, 2024, Hong Kong investors began trading six Bitcoin and Ether spot ETFs. They were sponsored by three prominent institutions from mainland China, Harvest Global Investments, China Asset Management (CAM), and Bosera Asset Management. Hong Kong has historically positioned itself as a hub for cryptocurrency. China banned cryptocurrency trading in 2021. The nation has a history of imposing bans and restrictions on cryptocurrencies. Although, at times China has reversed its policies, it has yet to change its latest ban. Exchange-traded funds are investment funds, traded on stock exchanges, mirroring the performance of an underlying index or asset. Likewise, exchange-traded notes are debt securities issued by financial institutions that track the performance of an underlying asset or index. The difference between the two is that ETFs typically hold the underlying asset, ETNs normally do not, but also typically expose investors to credit risk. There are many reasons why some would view Hong Kong ETFs as an important event. Many people hypothesized that the debut of Hong Kong ETFs, which followed the Bitcoin halving, would cause the price of Bitcoin to pump. Additionally, the ETFs could be viewed as a sign of mainstream adoption.

However, BeInCrypto is not responsible for any personal financial loss or gain incurred based on our content.  To learn more on how we evaluate each piece of content, please proceed to our verification methodology page Another month, another airdrop. This time, the Ethereum-based restaking platform EigenLayer is acknowledging its users, early adopters, and contributors with a much-anticipated airdrop. In addition to being a promotional event, the EigenLayer airdrop event is also a tested method to decentralized token ownership and encourage participation. But who can claim the tokens, and how does it work? This guide covers everything you need to know about EigenLayer airdrop eligibility and how to claim EigenLayer tokens. EigenLayer allows Ethereum stakers to further the utility of their staked ETH by using it across diverse, decentralized applications and protocols. Like many other platforms relying on blockchain technology, EigenLayer has also resorted to crypto airdrops to drive its strategic objectives. Here is the latest update released by the community: Updates on the EIGEN Stakedrop pic.twitter.com/1cwSForJnx Did you know? EigenLayer prefers to call its airdrops “stake drops,” focusing on increasing liquidity and enhancing the decentralized finance (DeFi) engagement. As mentioned, an airdrop from EigenLayer isn’t just a marketing gimmick. Instead, it comes with the following perks: Qualification for the EigenLayer airdrop depends on a user’s level of interaction with the EigenLayer ecosystem. Also, EigenLayer’s airdrop phases are segregated as Season 1 and Season 2, with Season 1 proceedings underway. Here’s a look at the eligibility (qualification) for Season 1. Firstly, the EigenLayer airdrop eligibility for season 1 is already taken care of via a snapshot that was captured on March 15, 2024. This means any move after this data capture will not result in additional tokens as part of the Season 1 rollout. Eligibility here depended on the extent of a user’s Ethereum restaking — either via staking in EigenLayer or utilizing other DeFi markets like Pendle. Staking via EigenLayer is eligible for 90% of the Season 1 stake drops, also referred to as Phase 1. Phase 2 stands for 10% of the airdrop rollout via Ethereum restaking using platforms other than the EigenLayer platform. Here are other aspects of the Season 1 rollout: Here are some additional details regarding the Phase 1 and Phase 2 of Season 1: Also, you can check the claim status of the Season 1 stake drop while reviewing the terms and conditions: Phase 2 details: The Eigenlayer FAQ docs offer clear information regarding the $EIGEN airdrop: Regarding the allocation process in Phase 2: – The Eigen Foundation communicated to each LRT project the amount of EIGEN reserved for their users. – Each LRT project will provide a list of wallet… pic.twitter.com/hRFg4wEoCE Even though the details of Season 2 are not yet completely clear, we could see another 5% of the allocated 15% as Season 2 stakedrops. Also, the focus of Season 2 will be on long-term engagement and protocol-specific contributions. Also, any kind of protocol interaction that happened after March 15, 2024, will qualify for Season 2. Here are some of the qualification metrics for Season 2: Other qualification details will be revealed by EigenLayer in days to come. Season 1 is done. However, here are the steps to participate in Season 2 of crypto airdrops from EigenLayer. Here is how the points are calculated: So it appears $EIGEN might be launching this week? I've seen pretty strong rumours but nothing is confirmed ofc. I created this sheet a few weeks back which shows the value of EigenLayer points as a function of the airdrop % and $EIGEN FDV Note, this assumes $EIGEN snapshot is… pic.twitter.com/rvcMLiGEfi Once the EigenLayer tokens are released, the entire aspect of DeFi integration will change. Based on what might happen, the airdrop eligibility for Season 2 can be determined via the following strategies: Simply put, EigenLayer might end up giving users free tokens to provide liquidity. Staking providers will also be able to manage and tweak their liquidity stake depending on the performance and health of the pool. Season 1 hasn’t been kind to the DeFi markets: Was just about to post a long rant but you should read the post below instead. Pendle and other EigenLayer DeFi users don't receive only 10% of the airdrop. It seems what they are trying to convey is that only 10% of the points generated in S1 came from these activities.… https://t.co/ZzKVvl5t0U Note: Only the Season 1 airdrop structure was eligible for testnet-based allotment via Goerli testnet. Now that Goerli is deprecated, newer testnet interactions via Holesky are not eligible to receive EigenLayer tokens as airdrops. In addition to the mentioned options, EigenLayer’s airdrop eligibility for Season 2 and other upcoming seasons might also depend on how well users stack up against Sybil attacks. The platform has already implemented strategies to prevent users from creating more than one account to claim multiple tokens. Over time, the robust identity verification process might be implemented throughout the ecosystem, with each instance attracting free tokens as airdrops. Honesty could go a long way in users receiving the EigenLayer airdrops. Before delving deeper into the criticisms, let us take a look at the Season 1 token allotment highlights: Other concerns highlighted: Had 3000 points but they disappeared 24h before claim, was left with 240 points. My manta supply and stake was never taken into account. My Pyth eligibility vanished. Today 0 zero ! It's like Eigen, layer zero, Linea, … don't like these EVM airdrops Here is a detailed explanation highlighting the rationale behind additional tokens, country-specific restrictions, and more: Why EigenLayer Gave Away More Tokens After Widespread Criticism of Its Stakedrop@sreeramkannan and @rjdrost discuss the loved and hated @EigenLayer airdrop and how they responded to community feedback. 💴 The role of EIGEN 🤑 Why they are giving users 100 additional EIGEN… pic.twitter.com/czaoZ1rl2A (Historical Image – 2024 – Colorized) The face of US users who spent 3 months paying 15% yields, loop farming Eigenlayer points on farming protocols, after reading they can't get the airdrop. pic.twitter.com/gvla3DxrBk Based on how things were for Season 1, experts believe the following enhancements will surface across the upcoming airdrop seasons: Season 1 of EigenLayer airdrops clearly mentions that the tokens are non-transferable. This means even after claiming EigenLayer tokens, you cannot simply move them to DEXs and CEXs to offload. Even though this initial restriction was criticized by many, it makes sense when it comes to avoiding rapid sell-offs. Based on how other airdrops in the past have materialized, gradual token releases are expected once Phase 1 and Phase 2 airdrop claims are handled for Season 1. Also, we expect EIGEN tokens to be available on the leading crypto exchanges in time. With the EigenLayer airdrop or any other similar event, navigating the space requires you to be aware of the terms and conditions beforehand. From verifying eligibility to identity, you must cover every required element before proceeding. Furthermore, it is crucial to check and verify EigenLayer airdrop claims using only the official EigenLayer website page. Airdrops present opportunities for scammers, with unscrupulous parties often waiting to prey on unsuspecting users and compromise wallet security. The idea is to remain safe, aware, and prepared, all while having complete control over your custody options. The EigenLayer airdrop signifies the distribution of free EigenLayer tokens to the qualified participants. This move is aimed to kickstart the adoption of the EigenLayer ecosystem and incentivize people interested in staking the already staked Ethereum to secure the diverse fecentralized applications (DApps) and protocols associated with the Ethereum network. Participating in crypto airdrops comes with highly specific requirements. For instance, if you take the EigenLayer airdrop into consideration, staking in EigenLayer is the primary criterion. The more staked Ethereum you push into the EigenLayer ecosystem, regardless of the custody options, the higher your chances of getting airdrops. Yes, EigenLayer has announced or rather unveiled its native EigenLayer token — EIGEN. Meant to facilitate a handful of governance-specific activities, interaction with AVS, and other activities, this native token will make its way into user wallets via airdrops. EIGEN, within the EigenLayer ecosystem, will also help generate staking rewards. In time, it is expected to have DeFi-specific use-cases. EigenLayer airdrop is a way to get more people associated with the ETH 2.0 upgrade vision by incentivizing them to restake. With restaking, it is possible to passively secure a host of DApps and protocols on Ethereum without actively validating them using nodes and networks. Plus, this airdrop brings community involvement into the mix.

The Open Network (TON) is a decentralized blockchain platform initially developed by Pavel and Nikolai Durov, the brothers who founded Telegram’s popular messaging app. The platform was created to provide a scalable and user-friendly blockchain environment. It’s designed to offer fast and scalable transactions and advanced, user-friendly features to promote broader adoption of blockchain technology. As a multi-blockchain system, TON supports various decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts. While the team behind Telegram originally developed the platform, it has since transitioned to an open-source approach and is now managed and enhanced by a community of independent developers. This ensures the platform remains decentralized and not under the control of any single entity. Toncoin (TON) is the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network. As the primary digital currency of TON, Toncoin plays a critical role in the network’s operations. It is used to facilitate transaction fees and as a means of exchange within the ecosystem.

To learn more on how we evaluate each piece of content, please proceed to our verification methodology page The Tezos blockchain supports various applications, spanning financial services to digital art and beyond. Like many well-known blockchain platforms, it uses a staking mechanism to maintain network security. Tezos lets you contribute directly to the network’s security and receive rewards. This guide dives into the essential information about Tezos staking. We explain what it means to stake your XTZ holding and examine the various methods available. We explored multiple options over several weeks to identify the top platforms for buying Tezos (XTZ). Our selection criteria focused on the core elements that make the buying/trading experience reliable and efficient. Our evaluation was largely based on key metrics such as security, fees, liquidity, ease of use, and compliance. Here’s a quick look at the reasons why we chose the following platforms: Kraken Kraken stands out as a goliath in the crypto space, having earned the trust of users across the world with its stringent security measures and exceptional market liquidity. The exchange deploys features like cold storage options, 2FA, and encrypted data storage to ensure that your transactions remain under lock and key. Kraken caters to new and seasoned traders by offering a giant pool of trading information and competitive transaction fees. Coinbase As one of the world’s largest and most popular exchanges, Coinbase commands the kind of trust you expect from your go-to crypto trading platform. It offers an intuitive interface that suits crypto newcomers particularly well. However, it is equally practical for experienced users who prefer advanced trading tools and options. Coinbase operates under strict regulatory compliance and offers sizable liquidity for multiple XTZ trading pairs. Ledger Ledger offers a unique proposition — it is a hardware wallet manufacturer that allows users to stake XTZ directly from the security of their device. This method is ideal for those seeking the ultimate protection for their XTZ stash, as it aims to blend the impenetrable security of cold storage with the functionality of active staking. Exodus Wallet Exodus Wallet is ideal for buying Tezos (XTZ) due to its integrated exchange feature, which allows users to seamlessly purchase XTZ directly within the wallet interface. This built-in functionality eliminates the need for external exchanges, streamlining the process and reducing transaction complexity. Additionally, Exodus supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies, enabling easy portfolio diversification. The wallet’s user-friendly design makes it accessible to both beginners and experienced users, facilitating an intuitive experience for managing and transacting in XTZ. OKX OKX stands out as a top platform for buying and staking Tezos (XTZ) due to its comprehensive suite of investment products that cater to various experience levels and risk tolerances. It offers competitive APY on cryptocurrencies and features a robust “Earn” section where users can select from a range of options, from low-risk savings accounts to high-risk, advanced dual investment products. OKX protects transactions with industry-standard encryption and secures significant digital assets using cold storage solutions. The platform also enforces multi-factor authentication and anti-phishing protocols to actively secure user accounts, making it a reliable and secure choice for managing and growing your cryptocurrency investments.

It has since become a major player in the blockchain space. Tezos facilitates the development and execution of smart contracts, which are basically self-executing agreements that power decentralized applications (DApps). Tezos allows stakeholders to participate in the network’s security and evolution by voting on proposed upgrades to the protocol. This approach eliminates the need or scope for any disruptive hard fork, which can ultimately fracture the user base. Notably, Tezos uses a unique proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism called liquid proof-of-stake (LPoS). Unlike many other blockchains, Tezos prioritizes formal verification, a process that enhances smart contract security by minimizing vulnerabilities. The platform also emphasizes modularity and upgradability, ensuring long-term scalability and adaptation. Tezos staking allows users to participate in the network’s consensus mechanism and contribute to its security. This is achieved through “baking” or delegating XTZ, Tezos’ native cryptocurrency. Bakers are champions of democracy. They accept delegation from tezos users through a liquid staking mechanic native to the chain. In turn, they are responsible for voting on Tezos issues in a manner that they feel furthers the interests of their delegates AND dole out staking… Baking vs. delegating: The delegation process in Tezos is relatively smooth and secure. It allows XTZ holders to contribute to network security without having to invest any substantial capital. Additionally, it safeguards them from the risk of asset loss due to slashing, which is a penalty enforced in many other proof-of-stake networks. This makes Tezos staking a popular choice for users looking to earn passive income while supporting network operations. You have two options if you plan on staking on the Tezos network. You could either be a baker or delegate your tokens to a baker. Each approach has advantages and drawbacks, so understanding the nuances is key to picking the one that best suits your risk appetite and goal. Bakers are the lifeblood of the Tezos network. They shoulder critical tasks like validating transactions, creating new blocks, and proposing and voting on network growth changes. However, this power comes with a hefty price tag — you must acquire a collateral of around 6,000 XTZ. This substantial financial commitment isn’t the only hurdle. As a baker, you also need specialized hardware to run the baking software and a decent amount of technical expertise to configure and manage their setups. Furthermore, you may have to be on your toes constantly to minimize downtime. This is important because a baker’s reputation depends squarely on their ability to run node operations reliably. That said, the rewards for bakers can be quite enticing. As a baker, you retain all block yields, ensuring a potentially lucrative return on your investment. So, to cut a long story short, bakers typically earn good returns on their investments, but baking is not a job for everyone. It demands serious commitment and comes with significant responsibility. You could consider delegating your XTZ to a baker if active participation seems overwhelming. This approach offers a more laid-back alternative. Your XTZ remains safely stored in your wallet, and you will have peace of mind knowing you have full control over your assets. This setup allows you to passively earn rewards and maintain a consistent source of passive income without any extra effort. While delegating offers flexibility, you have to beware of a few limitations. For instance, you can’t split your XTZ holdings across multiple bakers within the same wallet. However, you can change your delegation anytime by transferring your funds to a different wallet. Also, carefully evaluate a baker’s track record and commitment to fair reward distribution before signing up. Bakers typically charge a fee for their services, so assessing their fee structure and historical performance is crucial. If you are unsure whether to become a baker or a delegator, remember that it ultimately boils down to your risk tolerance, level of technical expertise, and the amount of time you can realistically dedicate to network participation. Follow these steps to start staking Tezos. For this demonstration, we’ll use Coinbase due to its user-friendly interface. The centralized exchange combines user-friendliness and security, making it a good option for XTZ staking. Other reputable options include Binance, Kraken, and OKX. The ideal platform depends on your priorities. Consider factors like security measures, ease of use, fees associated with staking, and the estimated annual yield (APY) offered. These factors can significantly impact your experience and the rewards you earn. Coinbase offers an APY of 4.51% on XTZ staking as of May 8, 2024. After choosing Coinbase as your staking platform, ensure you have Tezos (XTZ) in your account. You can purchase XTZ directly using fiat currency (USD or EUR) on Coinbase or transfer it from another wallet if you already own some. However, before proceeding any further, check your platform’s minimum staking amount requirement. Coinbase doesn’t have any minimum amount requirement, meaning you can start staking with 1 XTZ. Go to the staking section and choose from a list of available bakers or validators. Bakers are responsible for validating transactions and creating new blocks on the Tezos network. Evaluate each baker’s performance, reputation, and fees to find the best match that meets your expectations. Once you’ve selected a baker, specify the amount of XTZ you wish to delegate and confirm the transaction. You might need to verify the transaction using your password, PIN, or a security device, depending on your security settings. You will see a stake preview window. And that’s it! You have officially started earning rewards through Tezos staking. Tezos staking is beneficial for the staker and the network. Some of the key benefits of staking on Tezos include: While staking Tezos can earn you sizable profits, it’s important to understand the potential drawbacks: While it’s true that Tezos staking offers some exciting opportunities, just like with any other investment, there are certain risks. Here’s how you can avoid some of the common staking mistakes. Tezos rewards are shelled out periodically, with payouts happening after each cycle. These cycles clock in at roughly three days each. That said, there is a catch for those new to the staking game: an initial waiting period stands between you and your first Tezos payout. You may have to exercise patience for a few weeks after delegating your XTZ to a baker. This delay is necessary for the network to integrate your new delegation and ensure that your baking and endorsing rights are accurately factored in. As a Tezos staker, you may enjoy substantial rewards. Remember that staking rewards are taxable income in many jurisdictions, and Tezos staking is no exception. The exact tax implications may vary dramatically depending on your region. As a general rule of thumb, tax authorities expect individuals to report their staking rewards as income. This means you’ll be taxed on the fair market value of the XTZ you receive at the time of distribution. Keep in mind that it is not a matter of how much you paid for the original XTZ you staked. Rather, you will be paying taxes on the value of the newly minted XTZ rewards. You may also be subject to capital gains tax if you decide to sell your hard-earned staking rewards. This applies if the value of XTZ has climbed since you received it as a reward. We highly recommend users keep meticulous records of the dates and values when they receive and sell their XTZ. This is a must if you want to ensure you comply with tax regulations accurately. Kraken is a leading Tezos staking platform thanks to its superior security and commitment to user experience. Security-conscious users will appreciate Kraken’s industry-leading protective measures, such as comprehensive cold storage solutions and mandatory two-factor authentication. The platform offers a diverse range of staking options and competitive fees, positioning it as a versatile choice for seasoned users. Users also benefit from Kraken’s consistent uptime and stringent adherence to regulatory standards. Coinbase serves as an ideal entry point for beginners with its user-friendly interface and intuitive staking process. Being a regulated entity, Coinbase prioritizes user safety by maintaining a secure trading environment. Additionally, the platform allows for the direct purchase of XTZ using fiat currencies, facilitating an easy process to buy and stake Tezos without the need for an intermediary service. Ledger is one of our top platforms for staking Tezos (XTZ), renowned for prioritizing security to ensure the safest staking experience. Its hardware wallet technology is engineered to provide the highest protection possible. When you stake XTZ using a Ledger Wallet, you retain complete control over your private keys, which are stored offline, offering you ultimate peace of mind. This setup secures your Tezos assets from online threats while empowering you with direct management of your assets without intermediary risks. Exodus Wallet is a leading platform for staking XTZ as it expertly balances security with ease of use. The wallet is designed with a straightforward, intuitive interface and includes integrated staking functionality directly within the software, allowing for straightforward management of XTZ holdings. This makes it an outstanding choice for newcomers and experienced users who value a hassle-free and secure staking process. Additionally, Exodus supports many other cryptocurrencies, offering users the flexibility to manage multiple assets within a single platform, further enhancing its appeal as a comprehensive digital asset solution. If you’re interested in earning substantial passive income, Tezos (XTZ) presents a compelling opportunity. According to the Tezos block explorer TzStats, the staking rate exceeds 67% as of May 8. 2024, indicating that over two-thirds of all circulating XTZ tokens are actively staked. This high participation rate highlights the continued demand for Tezos staking. Furthermore, by staking XTZ, you can reap financial rewards and contribute to shaping the future of Tezos through your active involvement in its development. Remember that profits are never guaranteed, and the value of your holdings can fluctuate according to market sentiment and demand. Tezos staking remains an attractive option in 2024. With well over 67% of all XTZ tokens staked as of May 8, 2024, you can join a sizable community of active stakers earning passive income while contributing to network security. Beyond the financial rewards, staking also allows you to influence Tezos’ future by participating in its ongoing development. The exact APY for Tezos staking can fluctuate depending on various factors. These may include the platform you are using, the current staking rate, and network inflation. Tezos staking typically offers a competitive APY compared to other staking opportunities. For example, Coinbase offers an APY of around 4.51% for XTZ staking, whereas the corresponding figure for Ledger Wallet can go as high as almost 6%. You have multiple options to choose from. Popular choices include hardware wallets like Ledger, which offer a secure and user-friendly experience. You can also stake through cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase or other dedicated staking platforms. Ideally, researching different options would help you find one that aligns with your security preferences and staking goals.

APT holders can participate by voting on network proposals, leveraging the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. This article explores the top five platforms for users looking to buy APT, with insights into the unique features and advantages of each. BeInCrypto conducted a six-month evaluation to select the top five platforms where Aptos can be purchased. This assessment considered various factors specific to the platforms offering Aptos and other general criteria. Here are the factors evaluated for the chosen exchanges: Coinbase: Kraken: Bybit: Uphold: CoinEx To learn more about BeInCrypto’s Verification Methodilogy, follow this link. Coinbase has established itself as a leading platform in the crypto exchange market. Its extensive range of services is tailored to meet the needs of a global clientele. The platform is beginner-friendly, making it the perfect option for less-experienced users looking to buy APT with ease and without complexity.

The platform also features Coinbase Custody, enhancing security for institutional clients needing to safely store large volumes of cryptocurrencies. Kraken is one of our top choices for buying and selling APT thanks to its long-standing industry reputation and wide global presence. Founded in 2011 by Jesse Powell, Kraken is among the oldest and most established crypto exchanges and operates across Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania, and South America. Kraken provides a straightforward interface and caters to all user levels. It also facilitates both margin and futures trading, catering to sophisticated traders looking to leverage their positions. Notably, the exchange is renowned for its strong focus on security. The CEX implements rigorous measures to protect user funds and provide a safe trading environment.

Bybit is an ideal platform for users looking to buy APT, offering low spot fees (0.1% maker-taker) and high liquidity. The user-friendly CEX is well-suited for traders looking for a platform for all the bells and whistles due to its extensive leverage options and risk management tools. The exchange uniquely allows users to trade with up to 100x leverage on select assets, offering significant potential for profit amplification. It further supports trading safety with tools such as Bybit’s insurance fund, auto deleveraging, and the choice between cross and isolated margin accounts. These features collectively help manage and contain trading risks effectively. Bybit’s accessibility in over 200+ countries makes it a highly attractive option for global audiences. Uphold is an ideal platform for users looking to buy APT. The platform maintains a high level of transparency regarding its fee structure, ensuring users are fully informed about any fees and charges. Uphold’s comprehensive pricing model typically features a modest spread ranging from 0.4% to 1.0%. As well as supporting a diverse array of crypto, the platform offers users the opportunity to trade in precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum, and palladium. Furthermore, Uphold enhances the liquidity of these investments by allowing instant conversion into 27 national currencies and imposes zero custody costs. All assets, including precious metals and currencies, are spendable directly through the Uphold debit card. This combination of flexibility, low costs, and range of tradable assets makes Uphold a compelling choice for users looking to buy APT and explore other types of investment opportunities. CoinEx is an excellent platform for users looking to buy Aptos (APT) due to its user-friendly features and diverse trading options. CoinEx offers the advantage of no-KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements, allowing for quicker and more private trading. Users can effortlessly swap one cryptocurrency for another with a single click. The platform is equipped with a detailed interface for spot trading, making it accessible for both novice and advanced traders. Additionally, CoinEx supports margin trading, providing leverage ranging from three to 10x depending on the asset, which can enhance potential returns. This combination of privacy, ease of use, and flexible trading options makes CoinEx a standout choice for purchasing Aptos and other cryptocurrencies. The Aptos blockchain is an innovative layer-1 network developed by a number of the original creators of Meta’s abandoned crypto payment project, Diem. The blockchain’s stated aim is to become the safest and most scalable blockchain in the world. The blockchain employs a proof-of-stake (PoS) algorithm to validate and secure transactions across its network. PoS allows participants, known as validators or stakers, to verify transactions and create new blocks based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and are willing to “stake” as collateral. This system enhances network security while also incentivizing stakeholders to participate in the ecosystem. The web3-ready network supports both DApps and smart contracts, fostering trustless interactions and automating various processes. Additionally, Aptos employs innovative scaling solutions to ensure high throughput and low latency, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to supply chain management. Overall, the Aptos blockchain’s architecture and functionalities contribute to its efficiency, security, and scalability, positioning it as a leading force in the decentralized economy. "People are staying [on Aptos]… not only because of the tech, but because… for the first time in a while, a brand new programming language brings a new ecosystem that is more inclusive—that wants to help each other and wants to collaborate." Points were made @theempirepod 👏 https://t.co/0Q8rza0Jb5 The layer-1 blockchain implements unique technology design choices, including leveraging the Move programming language to bolster its code security and a unique Block-STM parallel execution engine to expedite transaction throughput potential. The use of Move as its native programming language ensures swift and secure transaction processing within its ecosystem. The Move prover, a formal verification tool tailored for smart contracts written in Move, enhances security measures by validating contract invariants and behaviors. This emphasis on security empowers developers with robust tools to safeguard their software against potential malicious threats, bolstering the overall integrity of the platform. Aptos launched on Oct. 18, 2022. Initially trading at 1 USDT, its value quickly soared by 10,000% after it was listed on the Binance exchange. This rapid growth ensured the coin quickly grabbed the attention of investors. The initial supply of APT at mainnet was 1 billion. The allocation was as follows: A majority of these tokens (410,217,359.767) are held by the Aptos Foundation, with a smaller portion (100,000,000) held by Aptos Labs. It is anticipated that these tokens will be distributed over a ten-year period: Do note that APT token distribution, as outlined above, is highly centralized, with staking reward unlocks that have no vesting schedule. This heightens the likeliness of venture capitalists dumping rewards on the open market, leaving unsuspecting retail investors caught short. As such, it is crucial to employ a comprehensive DYOR policy before choosing to invest in Aptos. Several crypto exchanges offer APT for purchase. This example will illustrate how to buy on CoinEx, a popular non-KYC exchange. 2. Fund your account: If your balance is zero, you’ll need to buy a cryptocurrency that can be exchanged for APT, such as USDT. 3. Find APT: Enter “APT” in the search bar at the top of the page. Click on it, and choose the “Swap” Option. 4. Enter the amount of USDT you plan to convert and click “Swap.” The system will automatically calculate the amount of APT you will receive based on the current market rate. Review all the transaction details carefully, confirm your information, and proceed to finalize the trade. The best platform for buying APT depends on individual needs and preferences. These factors include security, user interface, trading options, and geographical availability. Coinbase is celebrated for its strong regulatory compliance and beginner-friendly interface. Kraken provides extensive trading options and advanced security. Bybit is favored for high-leverage trading opportunities, whereas Uphold allows trading in cryptocurrencies and precious metals. Finally, CoinEx is preferred by those seeking privacy with its no-KYC policy. Note that each platform has its strengths and potential drawbacks. Remember to conduct due diligence and do your own research (DYOR) before investing in Aptos (APT). To buy Aptos (APT), you must create an account on a cryptocurrency exchange that lists APT, such as Coinbase, Kraken, Bybit, CoinEx, or Uphold. Once your account is set up and verified, you can deposit funds using bank transfer, credit card, or e-wallets. Aptos is listed on several major cryptocurrency exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken, Bybit, CoinEx, and Uphold. These platforms provide various trading pairs for Aptos, allowing you to trade them against cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and sometimes fiat currencies. The APT coin, the native cryptocurrency of the Aptos blockchain, was launched in October 2022. The launch followed significant interest and backing from various stakeholders in the cryptocurrency community, marking it as a notable event in the crypto calendar. Whether Aptos is better than Solana depends on specific criteria such as transaction speed, scalability, security, and developer community. Aptos claims high transaction throughput and scalability, but Solana is also renowned for its speed and efficiency. Aptos Labs, a team composed of former Meta (Facebook) employees who worked on the Diem blockchain project, is behind Aptos crypto. This team aims to create a highly scalable and usable blockchain, leveraging their experience developing blockchain solutions at a large scale. You can stake Aptos on exchanges that support staking functionalities, such as Kraken. This platform allows users to participate in staking directly through their trading accounts, providing a smooth way to earn rewards on holdings. However, offerings can change for other platforms, so it’s always a good idea to check the latest updates directly on each platform’s website or through customer support. The staking rate for Aptos can vary depending on the platform and market conditions. Generally, staking rewards are influenced by factors such as the total amount of APT staked on the network and the inflation rate set by the Aptos protocol. It’s important to check current rates on the platform where you intend to stake your APT. Comparing Aptos to Ethereum involves looking at transaction capacity, smart contract capabilities, and overall ecosystem. While Ethereum has a much larger and more established ecosystem with extensive developer support, Aptos offers promising technological advancements that could lead to higher throughput and efficiency. Each has its strengths, making them suitable for different use cases.

To learn more on how we evaluate each piece of content, please proceed to our verification methodology page YakDAO offers opportunities for average retail investors to gain crypto and real estate exposure via recreational glamping properties. So, how does it work, and is this the start of a broader real estate tokenization movement? Read on to find out in this comprehensive YakDAO guide. Yak is an eco-friendly, recreational camping site. Campers enjoy luxury camping, also known as glamping. With a location currently in Brevard, North Carolina, Yak has plans to expand to other sites as its platform grows. Notably, Yak’s camping sites are sustainable. The aim is to positively contribute to the surroundings while minimizing environmental impact as much as possible. As a result, Yak offers a unique and comfortable outdoor experience for those who want to enjoy nature without sacrificing modern amenities and a luxury touch. YakDAO is a fractionalized investment platform built around Yak services. It is a recreational property decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Anyone can invest in YakDAO to earn profits from Yak. David Woodbury founded YakDAO and is the current CEO. Woodbury has over 10 years of experience as a C-level executive, creating startups, raising millions in venture funding, and, crucially, building outdoor recreation and property management software. This innovative platform also has a list of notable sponsors and integrations, many of which are recognizable within the crypto and traditional finance (TradFi) spaces. Some of these include: The nexus of the YakDAO platform is the democratized ownership of the recreational properties offered by Yak. This model allows the average retail investor to gain exposure to a traditionally gate-kept process. The entire investment process begins with the Treasury. YakDAO gathers contributions from community members who receive Yak DAO (YAKS) in return. The DAO purchases unique outdoor recreational properties using the funds collected from the community treasury. YakDAO then develops and maintains these properties for commercial and community use. The total supply of YAKS is 100,000,000. It is a governance token on the Arbitrum blockchain, which allows customers to take advantage of relatively low fees and fast transaction confirmation times. 💰💡 Let's look at the tokenomics of $YAKS and unveil how it maintains its value within the YakDAO ecosystem! 💰💡 📊 Tokenomics Total Supply – 100 00 000 Initial Market Cap – $236 500 Fully Diluted Market Cap – $5 500 000 TGE Token Price – $0.055 💹 Value Maintenance: $YAKS… pic.twitter.com/BC07qIMEPA There are three primary ways that the YAKS token maintains its value to support the YakDAO ecosystem: 30% of the revenue generated by the properties goes into YAKS buybacks to fund staking pools. A percentage will also be used to buy back and burn YAKS, further enhancing the token’s value. Where we see finance/funds being the barrier to tokenizing all aspects of real world assets, what YakDAO was able to do with real world tangible assets, was to buy a property for a DAO, monetize with short term rentals and create token buybacks tied to DAO revenue. We believe this model is scalable and has many potential use cases. Stakers will not only earn more YAKS but can also earn NFTs, win free nights at the glamping property, and attend YAK Fest. Furthermore, invitations to the Governance Committee will be extended to top-tier token holders. 1. Obtain a web3 wallet: Before purchasing YAKS, you must first obtain a web3 wallet. Download a wallet and follow the instructions to secure it. Login and switch over to the Arbitrum blockchain to begin purchasing YAKS. We’ve used MetaMask in this example. 2. Go to Uniswap: Uniswap is the official decentralized exchange (DEX) earmarked for purchasing YAKS. Any other DEX offering YAKS may be a scam, so it is best only to use official platforms designated by the YaksDAO team. 3. Select the YAKS token: Make sure you are on the Arbitrum blockchain and have some crypto (e.g., ETH) to swap for YAKS. Search for the official Yak DAO token address in the Uniswap search bar. 4. Buy Yak DAO (YAKS): Select the amount of YAKS that you would like to purchase. Press confirm. You have officially purchased YAKS and can stake, trade, or participate in YakDAO governance. The benefits of YakDAO are clear. It uses real-world assets (RWA) to give back to its community while simultaneously using its community to bootstrap the ecosystem, similar to a feedback loop. This helps to create a sustainable and self-sufficient decentralized organization. The project offers a clear roadmap for investors and has thus far (as of May 2024) delivered on its promises. With many big-name investors on board, YakDAO presents a credible offering that aims to return a profit to investors but also build community. Included in the project plans are in-person events, including annual YAK Fest meet-ups, bringing together the Governance Committee and top YAK stakers. YakDAO offers a clear opportunity. Its journey from concept to tangible achievements in less than a year since launch demonstrates the strength of the project’s trajectory. However, investors should be aware that crypto investments are high-risk. Tokenization comes with its own barriers, particularly regulatory uncertainty and an education gap. While the YakDAO project is widening accessibility for investors who may not otherwise consider or be able to invest in property, it must be highlighted that profits are not guaranteed with any investment. Finally, as of May 2024, the YAKS token can only be traded on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). While DEXs offer the benefit of anonymity, they are less secure platforms than their centralized counterparts. Moreover, they often offer lower liquidity than CEXs and a steeper learning curve for new users. This may counteract YakDAO’s mission to widen investment accessibility, at least in the short term. Real estate tokenization is set to revolutionize how we invest in and manage real estate assets, making them more accessible and efficient. The $YAK token offers investors a chance to invest in tangible, real-world assets while benefiting from the power of decentralized finance. The project represents one exciting tenet of an overall trend toward the democratization of such investments. Tokenization offers the sector increased liquidity and transparency, thus making it more accessible to the average person. In all, it’s clear that YAKDAO is at the forefront of an industry poised for massive growth. Remember to always DYOR, and never invest more than you can afford. YakDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization that governs the Yak platform. Yak is an eco-friendly recreational property that allows customers to enjoy the outdoors without giving up amenities. The DAO governs Yak and allows retail investors to benefit from the profits made from Yak. YakDAO collects money from the community to purchase and develop properties for glamping. Investors receive the YAKS token in return. Then YakDAO engages in market operations to further enhance the value of the YAKS token to incentivize holders to hold. YakDAO allows the average investor to gain exposure to investment activities traditionally reserved for accredited investors. Customers can have fractionalized exposure to investment properties without actively maintaining the properties. Furthermore, YAKS holders may have the possibility to earn NFTs, participate in governance, or utilize the glamping facilities. Yes, there are some risks associated with real estate tokenization. Due to the fact that cryptocurrency and blockchain technology are still niche sectors, there are some regulatory risks that may not be immediately apparent. The real estate market is also volatile and illiquid, therefore, allowing access to retail customers who may not understand expose them to some risks. To invest in YakDAO, you will need a cryptocurrency wallet and some cryptocurrency to purchase YAKS. The Yak DAO token is on Uniswap on the Arbitrum blockchain, so you will need Arbitrum ETH to buy some. You should only use the official YakDAO website to learn how to purchase YAKS. Yak has plans to purchase and develop more property in the future. There are also plans for a multichain staking pool and a Mogul Rewards Engine. Lastly, there are plans to launch YakLAND shares by 2025.

With support for multiple profit amplifying and risk management tools, trading crypto on Binance Futures is seamless — although not without risk. This guide shows you how to trade crypto futures contracts on Binance like a professional. BeInCrypto experts tested several leading platforms to identify the top alternatives to Binance for futures trading. The evaluation was based on a comprehensive set of criteria including security measures, asset diversity, fee structures, unique platform features, and global availability. Here are their top picks, each distinguished by specific strengths: Kraken Bybit OKX The methodology for selecting these platforms included assessing each for its feature set that caters to both novice and experienced traders, ensuring they provide a secure and efficient trading environment. For a deep dive into BeInCrypto’s verification methodology, follow this link. Futures contracts are standard agreements to buy and sell a specific cryptocurrency at a predefined price at a set time in the future. While spot trades are executed immediately and are concerned with ownership, futures trading is all about speculating on the future price of a token. With futures came controversies: #BREAKING: Is the US covertly trying to BAN crypto? The CFTC just filed a lawsuit against Binance and its CEO alleging that the company conducted illegal futures trading and violated registration requirements. According to the CFTC, Binance allowed US customers to trade on the… pic.twitter.com/HzPmbdCZHk If studied properly, crypto futures can help track the price movement of the concerned asset. Here is how: The current price increase is driven by futures trading, so there is a risk of it rising and falling during the day!#eths #Ethereum #ETHUSDT #Crypto https://t.co/rtYmtY4SG9 pic.twitter.com/Vca943Bugb Futures contracts aren’t just tools associated with the crypto derivatives market. They can also impact the spot markets. It is important to note that the crypto ETF space also has futures-specific exposure, with ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF being one of the more notable funds. The intertwined world of crypto futures and crypto ETFs also highlights the rise of institutional investors in crypto futures, who are slowly gaining crypto market exposure without the need to hold decentralized assets directly. Note that for retail investors, futures are a highly risky business: Before you opt for futures trading in crypto. -> 90% of active retail traders lose money trading options and other derivative contracts as per SEBI. -> In 2022, investors lost $5.4 billion in futures trading. -> An average derivative trader loses $1,468 in a country where the… pic.twitter.com/1eBt656dw0 Crypto futures and crypto options are two popular derivatives instruments. Both play significant roles in cryptocurrency trading but serve different strategic purposes for traders on platforms like Binance (where they are listed under the same tab). Futures are a tricky market, especially for beginners. My take is to walk before you run. Cut your teeth on spot markets before introducing leverage to the equation. When or even if you start adding leverage, keep leverage low. Remember high leverage equals high risk, and low leverage equals lower risk. During a sideways market, the temptation will be to leverage up and go hard, but perhaps more patience is needed. Wait for the market to come to you. Sometimes, less is more, and you don’t need to be trading every tiny move in the market. If you are interested in Binance crypto futures, it is important to understand how they work before you begin trading. On Binance, you can trade quarterly futures (delivery) or perpetual futures. Trading on the world’s largest crypto exchange has its own set of benefits, especially when it comes to choices. Here is how each futures trading type works fundamentally: Binance offers futures contracts that expire quarterly — in March, June, September, and December. These are fixed-expiration contracts and do not come with the baggage of funding fees. The contracts settle on the expiration date and are ideal for traders who prefer hedging and speculating with a clearer timeline. Binance still doing between $15b to $45b in trading volume PER DAY from their futures trading ONLY👀 Roughly 20x the daily volume of ALL of decentralized perps combined (dYdX, GMX, Synthetix etc.)📊 Protocols building a CEX-like trading experience therefore have massive upside.… pic.twitter.com/EI75l961em Perpetual futures contracts have no expiration date. This way, traders can hold onto positions indefinitely on the condition that the margin is managed correctly. Plus, perpetual futures traders must also keep track of the periodic funding rates. These contracts are flexible and help navigate the market changes better. Quarterly and perpetual futures settled in stablecoins like Tether are termed USD-margined futures. The stability quotient is pegged to the USD. In 2024, Binance offers USDT and even USDC-settled futures contracts. These futures contracts are settled in the crypto that the contracts actually represent. For instance, a Bitcoin-specific futures contract is settled in Bitcoin. Now that we’ve covered some of the key information, let’s dive into the practical steps. Here’s how to trade crypto on the Binance Futures platform. Before you can start trading crypto futures on Binance, you must take the following steps. Keep track of orders where you can get better deals by utilizing the exchange’s native BNB crypto. Here’s what the entire Binance Futures crypto trading process looks like: Once all the order elements are handled, you must review them and confirm the trade to place an order. Did you know? Open interest plays a crucial role in futures trading. Open interest refers to the outstanding futures contracts that have not been settled. For traders, tracking open interest is important because it indicates the liquidity and depth of a particular market. High open interest suggests that many players are involved, which generally leads to better price discovery and more stable markets. Note: You can trade Binance Futures for all the top crypto assets, even via the mobile application. You should, however, choose Binance Pro and not Binance Lite for margin trading in the crypto derivatives market. The Binance crypto exchange allows you to play around with order types, especially when implementing adequate risk management tools. Here are the types that can help you stay on the safer side of the trade: This feature adjusts the stop price at a fixed percent below the market price as the market price rises. If the market price dips, the stop loss price doesn’t change. The market order is submitted when the stop price is hit. Futures trading allows you to trade with leverage, meaning you can open positions larger than your existing capital. Binance offers leverage from 1x to 125x. It’s crucial to understand that higher leverage increases both potential returns and potential risks. You can play around with the dashboard settings to choose the perfect risk-reward ratio for your trades. Here is how you can set these on Binance specifically: Besides the mentioned advanced risk management strategies, you can also set futures-specific trading preferences. These include selecting and customizing the following elements: So, how do all these elements of the Binance Futures trading platform work? Here is an example: If you have previously traded crypto futures, here are some of the more advanced elements found on Binance to help you take your trading performance to the next level: Here is a quick take on reading funding rates: “Bitcoin funding rate premium has heavily dropped off over the past 24 hours. That’s a good thing, especially if you are a spot buyer. This happening in a consolidation around prior ATH could fuel the next leg.” Automate your trades with #Binance Futures trading bots. Set your price levels, sit back, and let the bot do the rest! Get started ➡️ https://t.co/en7LBGp1oY pic.twitter.com/OCtTeOx14v These strategies and sections work regardless of the USD-M and Coin-M futures trading form you choose. Note that to get the most out of BBO and queue orders, you need to understand how an order book works with crypto futures trading platforms. As mentioned earlier, the crypto derivatives market on Binance extends beyond Bitcoin. You can trade all the top coins, with varying leverage, choice of settlement — delivery or perpetual, and the choice of an asset to settle in — USDT, USDC, or the contract-specific coin. Binance offers one of the best trading experiences for crypto futures. Yet, if you are concerned about trading regulations, geographical restrictions, and other elements, here are a few Binance alternatives to consider: Futures trading for beginners can be tricky. However, if you’re still keen to get started, trading crypto using Binance Futures is an excellent option, as the dashboard itself is self-explanatory and beginner-friendly. Regardless of your expertise and skill level, it is important to stay aware of the regulations and risk management techniques in order to keep your account and funds safe. However, if you are risk averse and just starting your crypto journey, it is advisable to focus on more traditional investment vehicles, such as crypto ETFs, rather than diving straight into the riskier world of futures. Yes, Binance Futures is a reliable trading option for beginners. Futures trading for beginners can be tricky if the platform is too complex or lacks the right educational tools. Binance solves this by offering a minimal approach towards the crypto derivatives market and leverage trading — the fundamental elements of futures contracts. Note that regardless of the platform you choose, futures are relatively complex financial intruments. Do not trade futures without a solid understanding and plan. To make $100 a day trading Bitcoin futures on Binance with BTC priced at $60,000, employ a strategy with careful risk management. Begin by setting a daily goal of $100 with a $10,000 account, using 10x leverage. Risk 2% per trade ($200), buying BTC at the supposed price of $60,000, setting a stop-loss at $59,500 to limit losses to $200, and aiming for a profit target of $60,300 to gain $150. This approach uses a 1:1.5 risk/reward ratio, requiring precise execution and active monitoring to adjust stop-loss and take-profit levels as needed. Note that this is theoretical. Profits are never guaranteed. To trade in crypto futures, you need to first start by creating an account. Then, you need to fund the futures wallet, learn the basics of futures trading, the concepts of leverage and margin, and start analyzing elements like the funding rate, open interest, and more to kickstart the proceedings. You can set a take-profit order at a specific price. This way, you can lock your profits. This aspect is necessary in the world of cryptocurrency derivatives trading as you can quickly book profits by closing the contracts before the market turns against you.

This method lets traders speculate on price movements, bet on prices going up or down, and potentially profit from these predictions. These contracts are typically leveraged, meaning traders can control large amounts of cryptocurrency with a relatively small amount of capital, which can increase both potential gains and risks. In contract trading, “long” and “short” are terms used to describe the types of bets traders make on the future price movements of cryptocurrencies. Both types of trading often use leverage, which means using borrowed money to increase potential returns. This can make both potential profits and losses significantly larger than in traditional trading. Choosing the right crypto contract trading platform involves considering various factors to ensure that the platform meets your trading needs and provides a secure, reliable environment. Here’s how to evaluate different platforms: Contract trading in cryptocurrency offers several benefits that make it an attractive option for many traders: Overall, the main benefit of contract trading in cryptocurrency is that it can provide sophisticated mechanisms for traders looking to exploit market inefficiencies, hedge, or increase exposure to markets with a relatively small capital outlay. Contract trading in cryptocurrency, while offering potential benefits, also carries several risks: Crypto contract trading and traditional options trading share some fundamental similarities. However, they also have distinct differences catering to different traders and investment strategies. Crypto contract trading platforms offer several advantages that can be appealing to both novice and experienced traders: While these advantages make crypto contract trading attractive, traders need to consider the associated risks and ensure they understand the market before participating. An anecdote of crypto contract trading going wrong: This is where the risks of contract trading and leveraged trading come in, and when you can't afford your risk, you shouldn't be doing it Investing in crypto contracts involves several straightforward steps. Here’s a simple guide to get you started: Before investing, learn about different types of crypto contracts, such as futures, options, and perpetual swaps. Understand the terms, mechanics, and risks associated with each. Selecting the right crypto futures trading platforms is essential for accessing various instruments and leverage options. Consider security features, regulatory compliance, trading fees, and customer support. Register for an account on your chosen platform. You will likely need to verify your identity with documents such as a passport or driver’s license, depending on the platform’s requirements and your region’s regulations. Once your account is set up, deposit funds. Most platforms accept cryptocurrency deposits, and some also support fiat currencies like USD or EUR. Choose your preferred method and follow the instructions to make a deposit. Develop a trading plan. Decide how much you want to invest, set your profit targets and loss limits, and how you will manage risks, especially since crypto contracts can involve leverage. Select the type of contracts you want to trade. Each contract has specific characteristics and terms, such as expiration dates for futures and strike prices for options. Learning how to trade Bitcoin options can significantly enhance your ability to manage risk and capitalize on market volatility. Use a trading interface to place your trades. You can choose from various order types, such as market orders (buy/sell immediately at current prices) or limit orders (set a specific price at which you want to buy or sell). Once you have opened positions, monitor the market closely. Use tools like stop-loss orders to manage risk. Moreover, be prepared to adjust your positions based on market movements and news. Decide when to exit your trades. Depending on the contract type, you can close your positions by executing a trade in the opposite direction or letting your options or futures expire. After closing your positions, you can choose to withdraw your profits or reinvest them into new contracts. Check the withdrawal procedures and limits on your platform. Following these steps will help you start investing in crypto contracts. Remember, it’s important to continually educate yourself and stay updated with market trends and news to make informed decisions. Looking to expand beyond the spot markets but not sure where to start? Here’s how to trade Bitcoin futures and options like a pro. Choosing the right crypto contract trading platform is essential. Whether your focus is on derivatives or leverage trading, the ideal platform should offer competitive trading fees, a user-friendly interface, and robust features. Remember that contract trading is high-risk, and you should never invest more than you can afford to lose. OKX, BingX, and Binance are considered some of the best platforms for options trading in cryptocurrency, offering extensive tools and a wide range of options. They provide deep liquidity, robust trading interfaces, and comprehensive security measures. Each platform caters to different levels of trader expertise and geographical availability. To evaluate the liquidity of a trading platform, check the trading volume of your desired assets, observe the tightness of the bid-ask spread, and note the speed at which trades are executed. High trading volumes and narrow spreads typically indicate good liquidity. Platforms often publish their liquidity metrics, which can provide further insights. Common fees in crypto contract trading include trading fees (maker and taker fees), withdrawal fees, and, in some cases, overnight financing fees (or funding rates) for holding positions open over a period. Trading fees vary by platform and can be reduced based on trading volume or platform-specific tokens. Some platforms may also charge deposit fees or fees for special order types. Yes, you can trade cryptocurrency contracts through various derivatives like futures, options, and perpetual swaps. These contracts allow traders to speculate on the future prices of cryptocurrencies without directly holding the asset. Most major crypto exchanges offer some form of contract trading. The best platform for crypto trading depends on the trader’s needs, but Binance and Kraken are widely regarded as leading choices. They offer many cryptocurrencies, advanced trading features, and robust security measures. Considerations for choosing a platform should include fees, available cryptocurrencies, and user interface. Yes, Binance is a contract trading platform that offers a variety of derivative products, including futures and options. It provides high liquidity, extensive leverage options, and a wide range of crypto pairs. Binance is known for its low fees and comprehensive platform features. The compatibility of contract trading with Islamic finance principles depends on the specific contract and trading method. Generally, conventional leveraged contract trading might not be considered halal due to the involvement of interest, excessive uncertainty, and speculation. However, Islamic finance products that comply with Shariah law are available on some platforms.

We selected Coinbase Wallet for its comprehensive crypto management features and user-friendly interface. The wallet simplifies buying, selling, and staking of multiple assets, including ARB. Additionally, Coinbase Wallet’s integration with decentralized applications (DApps) enhances user interaction within the ARB ecosystem, making it a convenient and secure option for users looking to engage with decentralized finance (DeFi). We identified CoinEx Wallet as an optimal solution for ARB storage thanks to its diverse functionalities and simple set up. The wallet offers features like staking, a DApp browser, and a transaction accelerator, which streamline the management of ARB tokens. CoinEx Wallet also supports cross-chain swaps and provides significant leverage options for spot and futures trading, making it a versatile platform for ARB investors seeking to maximize trading strategies. OKX Wallet not only represents a safe and secure option for ARB storage; it also acts as a web3 gateway. The decentralized multi-chain wallet facilitates access to over 1,000 DApp protocols and supports features like yield farming and an NFT marketplace. With multi-chains support, including Ethereum and Arbitrum, OKX Wallet simplifies the management of ARB tokens across different networks, offering a seamless experience for users engaged in the decentralized ecosystems. Arbitrum is a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum developed by Offchain Labs. The New York-based company was founded by Ed Felten, a computer science professor at Princeton, Steven Goldfeder, a PhD graduate, and Harry Kalodner, a current PhD student at Princeton University. Designed to address some of the inherent limitations of Ethereum-based smart contracts, such as low efficiency and high execution costs, Arbitrum significantly reduces transaction costs and enhances user experience by avoiding the high gas fees typically associated with the Ethereum network. It processes transactions off the main Ethereum chain using Optimistic Rollup technology, which increases throughput and ensures transactions are executed more swiftly while maintaining the full security of the Ethereum mainnet. ARB is the governance token of the Arbitrum layer-2 blockchain, developed by Offchain Labs in 2021 to enhance Ethereum’s scalability. Although ARB tokens are not used to pay transaction fees on the Arbitrum chain, they hold significant use cases, primarily in governance and network decision-making. As of May 10, 2024, ARB has a market capitalization of $2,758,848,660, per CoinMarketCap data. It is priced at $1.04, sitting 56.43% below its all-time high of $2.40 (reached in January 2024). When selecting an Arbitrum (ARB) wallet, look for robust security features such as 2FA, end-to-end encryption, and hardware support. Here are other factors to be on the lookout for: The process of setting up a crypto wallet is simple and tends to be similar regardless of the wallet you choose. For this example, we’ll use the CoinEx Wallet. Here’s a quick walkthrough to get you started: 2. Creating a strong password is crucial when setting up your wallet. This should be a unique combination of letters, numbers, and special characters you have not used elsewhere. 3. During the wallet setup process, you will be prompted to write down mnemonic words from one to 12. Recording these words in a safe place offline. Note that your account may be irretrievable afterward if you lose this phrase. 4. Voila! After setting up your wallet, you can add ARB by going to the network selection area. The best Arbitrum wallet is the one that most suits your individual needs and requirements. Consider your investment goals. Are you looking to hold ARB long-term? If so, a hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor makes the most sense. Those looking to trade ARB and have instant access to holdings may prefer a hot wallet like the Coinbase Wallet, OKX Wallet, or CoinEx Wallet. Regardless of the storage solution you choose, ensure to prioritize crypto wallet security at all times. Wallets like Ledger, Trezor, Coinbase Wallet, CoinEx Wallet, and OKX Wallet can hold assets on the Arbitrum network. These wallets support Ethereum and, by extension, can manage native tokens of its layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum. This compatibility allows users to interact with decentralized applications (DApps) and efficiently manage their digital assets on the Arbitrum layer. Arbitrum tokens can be stored in secure wallets that support Ethereum layer-2 networks. Popular choices include hardware wallets such as Ledger and Trezor for high security and software wallets like Coinbase Wallet, CoinEx Wallet, and OKX Wallet for ease of use and accessibility. These options provide robust security features and user-friendly interfaces for managing Arbitrum tokens. Yes, you can use Arbitrum on Trust Wallet. Trust Wallet supports Ethereum and its layer-2 networks, including Arbitrum. This allows you to access and interact with Arbitrum’s scaling benefits, manage tokens, and use DApps that operate on the Arbitrum network directly through Trust Wallet. Arbitrum has established partnerships with several prominent names in the cryptocurrency sector. Among its partners are Polygon (MATIC), which collaborates on scaling solutions, and Aave, a leader in decentralized finance. Other significant collaborators include Balancer, Chainlink, and Curve Finance. Yes, Binance accepts Arbitrum. This integration facilitates easier and more efficient transactions using Arbitrum’s enhanced throughput and reduced gas fees. It allows Binance users to benefit from faster and more cost-effective Ethereum transactions. The collaboration between Binance and Arbitrum highlights a significant step towards greater scalability and efficiency in the crypto ecosystem. Several key features are essential for an optimal user experience when choosing an ARB wallet. Security measures are a critical factor, with features like two-factor authentication and multi-signature support ensuring that assets remain safe from unauthorized access. A smooth user interface (UI) experience is important for ease of use, enabling users to navigate the wallet’s features without complications. Mobile wallets can be safe for storing Arbitrum tokens if they incorporate strong security features such as 2FA, biometric locks, and regular software updates. While inherently riskier than hardware wallets due to their connectivity, reputable mobile wallets like Coinbase Wallet ensure high security and user-friendly access to Arbitrum tokens. Yes, you can use an Ethereum wallet for ARB tokens since Arbitrum is a layer-2 solution built on the Ethereum network. Wallets that support Ethereum, such as Ledger, Trezor, and Coinbase Wallet, automatically enable the management of ARB tokens and interaction with Arbitrum’s platform. First, to transfer ARB to a wallet, ensure your wallet supports Arbitrum, like Ledger, Trezor, or Coinbase Wallet. Next, add the Arbitrum network to your wallet, locate your Arbitrum-compatible wallet address, and initiate a transfer from the exchange or another wallet to this address. Ensure you select the correct network (Arbitrum) to avoid losing funds. Do note that the process can vary depending on the platform you’re using.

Yet, Binance is not just a trading platform offering indicators, trading tools, and tradable assets. It is also a one-stop on-ramping/ offramping platform, helping users convert their hard-earned money to crypto and vice versa. With Binance P2P, users can directly buy and sell crypto in an open market. This Binance P2P guide takes you through how the process works and how to navigate the P2P space safely. P2P stands for peer-to-peer. P2P crypto transactions signify the transfer of assets between two people without a middleman. Even though Binance is typically a middleman when you execute spot and limit trades, charging marker and taker fees along the way, it has a separate P2P section to fulfill the individual-specific crypto supply and demand. Low transaction fees, privacy protection, and secure transactions are just some of the advantages of trading on #Binance P2P. pic.twitter.com/uvo41ATKD3 Think of P2P as selling your crypto directly to a person and receiving cash (bank transfers) in return. Here’s how the process is initiated on any peer-to-peer crypto exchange: This is what a simplified version of a peer-to-peer transaction looks like. Even though the concept of P2P holds for any peer-to-peer crypto exchange, Binance offers additional anonymity and a wide selection of tradable assets. You can buy BTC and other crypto assets using direct payment methods or sell USDT, BNB, or a host of other cryptos and get paid directly into your e-wallet or bank account. Binance P2P buying and selling makes life easier for users who receive their salary or fee in crypto, want to initiate quick trades, offload assets quickly, and make quick crypto purchases to ride market sentiments, among other things. Of course, Binance isn’t the only P2P crypto exchange in town. Several Binance alternatives include the likes of OKX, Paxful, and Hodl Hodl. This Binance P2P guide/explainer will highlight how a few simple components comprise the entire P2P architecture. Here are the underlying elements. To use Binance’s P2P functionality, you first need to create a basic user account. Note that peer-to-peer account setup requires stringent KYC verification, regardless of whether you are a buyer or a seller. You can enhance your Binance P2P buying, selling, or rather trading profile by relying on ads. These advertisements position your P2P need at the top of the list, allowing buyers and sellers to locate you quickly. Notably, placing ads comes with a few conditions: Did you know? When setting up your advertisement, you can choose between a “Buy” or “Sell” ad type, select the crypto asset and fiat currency, and choose between fixed or floating pricing. Additionally, you can specify the total trading amount, order limits, and up to three payment methods. You also have the flexibility to add terms and an auto-reply message when users respond to your ad. As for the changes, new trade advertisements can be subjected to transaction fees, anywhere between 0 and 0.35%, depending on the pair’s liquidity. In Binance P2P, the pair signifies the crypto you wish to trade and the currency you wish to offload or purchase it in. The entire buyer-seller interaction on Binance is managed by an escrow. Here is how it works: Once a buyer accepts an offer, the seller’s cryptocurrency is automatically locked in Binance’s escrow service. This escrow holds the crypto securely until the transaction is completed, ensuring that the seller does not lose their crypto if the buyer fails to pay. Binance P2P payment methods range from standard bank transfers to UPI (India-specific) to e-wallets and others. “Bharat Web3 Association shared a video with RBI on Binance P2P trades and then requested the central bank to permit the resumption of UPI/payment services for the VDA (crypto) sector. Soon you can expect a crack down on Binance P2P use in India or resumption of UPI services.” As someone looking to buy or sell USDT or any other cryptocurrency, you can tweak and choose the Binance P2P payment methods depending on your region of operation. The seller leads the fund-release mechanism and must confirm the payment. Once done, the Binance P2P escrow releases the digital assets to the buyer’s wallet. This issue will be there, without P2P. With P2P, this risk shifts to the seller. Because then, funds will be received in Bank account of seller of crypto. That is why we see many Binance users complaining that bank account is frozen. Here is how the process works: When you initiate a transaction on Binance P2P, the crypto that’s being sold is temporarily transferred to Binance’s escrow service. This secure holding continues until the buyer has paid and confirmed it within the platform. Once the seller confirms receiving the payment, Binance releases the cryptocurrency from escrow to the buyer. If any disputes arise, either party can initiate an appeal, which leads to an investigation by Binance’s customer support to resolve the issue and decide the rightful owner of the funds. The escrow mechanism functions by automatically reserving the cryptocurrency when an advertisement for selling crypto is posted. This amount is deducted from the seller’s funding wallet and held securely by Binance. If a buyer marks a transaction as paid but fails to transfer the funds, or if there’s any other dispute, the seller can appeal, and Binance will hold the crypto in escrow until the issue is resolved based on the provided evidence. This escrow system ensures that transactions are safe and minimizes the risk of scams and theft, which is crucial given the irreversible nature of cryptocurrency transactions. The service also incorporates identity verification measures to ensure that all users trade under their true identities, enhancing the platform’s overall security. In cases where there is a dispute — such as a buyer claiming that the payment was made but the seller not releasing the cryptocurrency — the involved parties can file an appeal. It’s shocking – So many people are reporting that they used P2P which resulted in Bank account freeze. These are only 50% of the messages that I received on x. Have even more on email. Will be making a detailed video on this topic soon covering : Steps to follow, how to get… pic.twitter.com/fN5eGOGJyv Other concerns like bank account freeze, chargeback placements, and more can also be raised using Binance’s dispute resolution mechanism. Binance’s customer service then steps in to resolve the dispute based on evidence provided by both sides, such as payment receipts or chat logs. If you want to buy or sell USDT or any other crypto, you should check the feedback and rating before proceeding. You can find the details by clicking on the buyer profile. The P2P page also has other tabs — Express, Block, Cash, and P2P. Each refers to a different kind of peer-to-peer cryptocurrency order type. The P2P Express Zone simplifies the trading process by allowing you to place orders quickly by entering the fiat amount you want to buy or sell. The system then matches you with the best available order from a verified merchant. This method best suits crypto novices and those starting out their P2P journey. The Block Trade Zone is for users interested in making large-volume trades. This zone ensures that such trades are handled securely, typically involving verified merchants known as block traders. At some specific locations, certain buyers might provide cash-based selling facilities. However, you must deal in a safe environment to avoid getting scammed. #Binance P2P Supports Cash-in-Person Transactions as a Payment Method ➡️ https://t.co/EKhvgIcAAw pic.twitter.com/Uqjb7oVZ1h It is important to check how all these elements pertaining to the Binance P2P architecture work in unison. Here are the steps to consider: If you want to buy crypto using the Binance P2P interface, you can click on the “Buy” tab, and at first, you will see the advertisements. If you like an offer posted by the seller — preferred rates and payment methods — you need to hit the “Buy” button against the seller’s name. Do note that as the buyer, you can raise a cancellation request first. You can then verify the seller credentials, maximum amount, past orders, and more on their profile page. If you want to sell, you need to connect with a buyer. If you plan to sell USDT or any other supported crypto, you are the one in charge of the assets. Only when you confirm receipt of the funds will the buyer receive the relevant digital assets. Before that happens, the cryptocurrency is held securely by the Binance Escrow. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) support a form of peer-to-peer (P2P) trading. However, they operate differently from traditional P2P platforms like those provided by centralized exchanges (CEXs). In DEXs, the P2P aspect is inherent in the technology — traders interact directly with each other via blockchain-based smart contracts rather than through a managed platform that facilitates trades with traditional order books. Do note that DEX-based P2Ps are more like token swaps as to off-ramp, you will always need a CEX. However, cash-based P2P transactions — also known as F2F or face-to-face transactions — can be initiated using DEXs. The Binance P2P interface comes with a host of features. Some of the most obvious ones include: You can consider these features as the Binance P2P trading benefits. P2P transactions seem easy. Yet, they have their own share of pitfalls. Here’s what to be aware of: Genuine P2P concerns: 3/ Identified accounts at Noones and Paxful (P2P marketplaces) that received funds from the hacks and were used to convert crypto to fiat. pic.twitter.com/0O3V726dAq Tax obligations for P2P transactions can be unclear and vary by jurisdiction, complicating compliance for users who may not understand their tax liabilities from crypto trading. For instance, if you are from India and filing taxes, you must report the nature of your crypto dealings, including P2P. CA Sonu Jain, a crypto tax specialist, spoke with BeInCrypto about tax-specific approaches toward P2P trading and how an average trader could navigate these scam-filled waters. “Investors who are engaged in P2P trading should be cautious when dealing with unknown individuals online. Investors in India, for example, can take some of the below steps to mitigate the risk of fraud: These steps although may sound lengthy and difficult, but they will help you stay away from scammers & deal with genuine Investors.” In some cases, Binance hasn’t fully cooperated with the authorities to quell concerns related to anti-money laundering and scams. Several subsidiaries like the Binance U.S. may have P2P restrictions on them due to (a lack of) regulatory oversight. As a buyer or seller, you should take note of this before proceeding. Nigeria's Central Bank has now prohibited banks from processing #bitcoin and cryptocurrency transactions. The country ranks second in P2P #bitcoin volume. pic.twitter.com/2bSXoPv6h6 In the world of P2P, security must be a top priority. Here are a few safety tips to follow: This Binance P2P guide shows the ease with which users can conduct peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions. However, in light of the growing prevalence of scams and the need for greater regulatory innovation, we expect this peer-to-peer crypto exchange to move to offer additional security standards, like anomaly detection and enhanced encryption. Furthermore, in the future, Binance is likely to increasingly rely on AI for more optimized order-matching experiences, especially for crypto newcomers. Binance P2P can be profitable, especially for those who act as merchants on the platform. Merchants earn by posting trading ads and completing trades, benefiting from low-fee structures, and sometimes participating in special promotions. The platform’s zero trading fees policy ensures that traders can maximize their returns without deductions for transaction fees, enhancing profitability. Plus, if you regularly indulge in Binance P2P trading, you can even earn using the frequent disparities between the buying and selling prices of USDT or any other supported crypto. Binance P2P is generally considered safe. It uses an escrow service to hold the cryptocurrencies until both parties confirm the transaction’s completion, providing a layer of security against fraud. However, there has been a recent rise in the number of P2P-led scams, with some buyers sending disputed funds to the sellers, leading to the latter being targeted by the authorities. Even though Binance doesn’t explicitly offer P2P services in the U.S. due to regulatory challenges, some users rely on VPNs to locate cash-based zones. However, this is not safe and not recommended considering Binance’s sophisticated location-tracking tools.

However, BeInCrypto is not responsible for any personal financial loss or gain incurred based on our content.  To learn more on how we evaluate each piece of content, please proceed to our verification methodology page LocalMonero, the platform that facilitated anonymous, no-KYC, P2P Monero (XMR) trades, has announced it is shutting down. And with it goes one of the last remaining bastions of truly anonymous P2P crypto services. The shuttering of the platform has expectedly raised concerns for privacy-conscious traders and investors as they scramble to find LocalMonero alternatives. In 2024, options are somewhat limited due to the relentless crackdown by global financial regulators on privacy coins and services. However, there are still a few LocalMonero alternatives out there that you may want to try out. Let’s take a quick look at some of these options. Everything was more or less normal with LocalMonero until May 7, 2024, when the platform announced that it was time to wind up operations permanently. LocalMonero didn’t offer any specific rationale behind the decision, although it briefly mentioned that a mix of “internal and external factors” led to it. While the announcement didn’t make any such reference, it is believed that growing hostility against privacy-centric crypto and blockchain products likely played a big role in forcing that move. Another domino is falling… 😥LocalMonero, the essential marketplace for buying/selling XMR peer-to-peer, is closing down without giving a reason. 🫡 https://t.co/788cFxdvjA So, where does it leave LocalMonero users now? Here’s a roundup: Essentially, the shutdown is effective immediately. Therefore, it’s crucial to find suitable LocalMonero alternatives quickly if you want to continue enjoying privacy-focused features for your XMR trades. LocalMonero has been a trusted platform for buying and selling XMR since 2017. Several factors contributed to its immense popularity. These include its ability to allow anonymous transactions while being backed by an end-to-end encryption messaging system. The platform hosted a wide spectrum of global traders, offering varying rates and payment options. You could filter buy and sell offers by your preferred country, payment method, and desired fiat/crypto pair. So make sure that whichever LocalMonero alternative you switch to offers most of these advantages — if not all. Primarily, you should look for a platform that: Additionally, the ideal LocalMonero alternative should offer you the option to buy and sell XMR for fiat. As of May 2024, not many LocalMonero alternatives meet these criteria. A tightening regulatory grip on privacy coins has squeezed some previously compliant platforms to abandon their user-friendly, anonymous approach when it comes to XMR and P2P. So, with those factors in mind, we do have to remind you that there are no real alternatives to LocalMonero — not yet, at least. These listed options are only those that come close. Bisq is definitely the closest it gets when it comes to LocalMonero alternatives. It is a decentralized trading platform that allows you to buy and sell XMR relatively easily. However, the interface is probably not as beginner-friendly as LocalMonero’s offering. Bisq doesn’t require you to go through KYC processes. It has a decent amount of liquidity for XMR trades — not nearly as high as what LocalMonero used to offer, but the odds are high that it will get there eventually, considering it is one of the few remaining options as of May 2024. Trades involving altcoins on Bisq typically have a default settlement period of one day. However, for those seeking faster transactions, Bisq offers an “Altcoins Instant” account option, which reduces the trade period to just one hour. This option is crucial for traders prioritizing speed and efficiency in their XMR transactions. The platform requires that Monero sellers actively provide proof of payment. This proof includes a transaction key, transaction ID, and the recipient’s address. This unique approach is required because Monero’s stringent privacy features obscure certain transaction details on the blockchain, which, in turn, complicates dispute resolution. Sellers can generate the proof from several compatible Monero wallets, including the official Monero GUI and CLI wallets, among others. Overall, this process ensures that in the event of a dispute, mediators or arbitrators have the necessary information to make a fair judgment. Bisq streamlines Monero transactions with an automated confirmation feature, expediting the verification of XMR payments. This feature eliminates the manual verification process for the buyer, which means the process only requires a valid transaction key from the seller and activation of this setting by the buyer. That said, manual confirmation remains an option if you prefer more old-school methods. Heads up before you read any further: Despite TradeOgre’s established presence and user base, the platform has raised red flags on multiple occasions in the past. It has faced criticism for its lack of transparency, and there have even been claims of users losing money due to alleged malpractices. So, make sure to do your research before trusting the TradeOgre with your money. The platform appears on this list because it is one of the few no-KYC platforms around that still supports XMR. The platform has been around since 2018. It claims to prioritize user anonymity and, therefore, doesn’t require any KYC verification. TradeOgre supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies, including XMR. It offers a simple, minimalistic user interface that makes processes easy for new users. It’s not the prettiest or the most modern interface, but it is functional and straightforward. You can buy XMR on TradeOgre using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or USDT. However, the platform does not support transactions via PayPal or credit cards. You only need an email address and a password to register. Once registered, you can deposit a compatible cryptocurrency and trade for Monero directly on the exchange. Additionally, users can store their Monero on TradeOgre or withdraw it to a private wallet if they are not actively trading. However, you can not buy Monero with physical cash directly through TradeOgre. Haveno is a promising but incomplete LocalMonero alternative. In fact, the LocalMonero shutdown announcement even mentioned it as one of the upcoming platforms to look out for. “Fortunately, the Monero ecosystem has matured a lot over these years, and with the imminent launch of Haveno and other DEXs like Serai, atomic swaps, the coming addition of FCMP (full blockchain anonymity set replacing rings of 16) as well as the continuing and rapidly accelerating development of the Monero protocol, we’re confident that Monero’s future is bright, with or without our platform.” Put simply, Haveno is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that leverages Monero’s privacy features to offer anonymous and secure trading. Haveno provides a platform for exchanging cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether, and Bitcoin Cash with fiat currencies such as USD, EUR, and GBP, all paired against XMR. The exchange is designed to be non-custodial, meaning users can retain control of their funds without undergoing KYC. As of May 2024, Haveno is still in development and not yet fully operational for public use. It’s anticipated to be ready by the end of 2024. The documentation for the Mainnet was released on May 12, 2024 — so there is a fair amount of work still to be done. If you have the skills, please consider jumping into the @HavenoDEX project to get the app developed to continue LocalMonero's cash in-person mission Desktop Haveno main net was technically released, but work remains, and the network is not standing up yet https://t.co/qlf9oxzq52 The platform will support a range of payment methods that do not require a bank account, like cash in person or cash by mail, which may greatly enhance its accessibility for peer-to-peer transactions. All said, Haveno remains a work in progress. Its future as a reliable trading platform depends on the completion of development and community acceptance. As this guide shows, Bisq stands out as the closest real LocalMonero alternative. Platforms like TradeOgre (despite its user base) and the in-development Haveno, while promising, lack the complete package LocalMonero provided. The abrupt closure of LocalMonero has certainly stirred significant activity within the privacy coin community. Regulatory pressure might be rising, but it’s also likely to further fuel innovation and ingenuity. There’s a strong likelihood that we will witness a surge of new platforms attempting to address these challenges and emerge as viable LocalMonero alternatives. We will continue to monitor these developments closely to keep you posted on any significant progress. Until then, weigh your options carefully before going all in. Peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto trading allows for direct transactions between individuals without the need for a centralized intermediary. This method of trading improves privacy and reduces transaction costs. P2P trades also offer greater control over the terms of trade and potentially better pricing due to the competitive nature of the marketplace. Additionally, P2P platforms often support a wide range of payment methods, making them accessible to a broader audience. When it comes to the best Monero trading platform, ideally you want something that doesn’t require KYC. Keep in mind that you will likely come across many “no-KYC” platforms that will later require you to go through KYC verification to access XMR transactions (or perhaps even their P2P services). No, LocalMonero did not require users to complete KYC procedures. This feature was key to its appeal as it allowed users to trade Monero anonymously, which was fitting for the privacy coin’s privacy-centric priorities.

Binance is a reliable peer-to-peer crypto exchange offering resources and tools for traders looking to buy and sell crypto between themselves. This guide demonstrates how to buy and sell USDT (or any other crypto) using Binance’s P2P trading interface. As USDT is a stablecoin, it is the nearest to any fiat currency you wish to off-ramp to in terms of steady pricing. Even for on-ramping, USDT is more like crypto cash, free of the inherent price volatility associated with other assets like Bitcoin, BNB, ETH, and more. Therefore, USDT/USD, USDT/INR, and other USDT-specific pairs are the most sought-after in the Binance P2P space. Here’s another reason why P2P platforms have garnered popularity, particularly in countries like India: “Indian Govt Collected ₹ 105 Cr in TDS on VDA transactions. In my opinion this is a pretty low number as high TDS led to most of the volumes shifting to offshore or P2P platforms. I believe this number could be at least 10-20x higher if a lower TDS rate (0.1% or 0.01%) was introduced, also serving the purpose of tracking and tracing VDA transactions.” As Gupta explains, a large chunk of crypto users shifted to P2P platforms in 2023 as direct trades between this community didn’t account for taxes. Even though purchasing USDT using P2P on Binance is relatively straightforward, there are a number of steps that can minimize headaches: Did you know? As someone looking to buy USDT on Binance P2P, you can even advertise the quantity you are willing to by along with the offered price. Sellers can use this data to filter, based on preferences. Now that the basic elements are out of the way, here are the steps to kickstart the transaction process: Unless you have already paid the sum, as a buyer, you are free to cancel the deal if you feel something is off with the seller. Sellers on Binance P2P have a more difficult task as they are the ones who receive the funds. Despite the challenges, there are several steps to follow to sell USDT easily: Note: A safe practice for sellers is to check for the buyers manually, as once matched, you, the seller, cannot cancel the order. What is a chargeback? For #Binance P2P transactions, a chargeback happens when your trade partner requests to have their funds back after you’ve completed the transaction. Swipe for tips on how to avoid them 👉 Once you are satisfied with everything, release the crypto from Binance’s escrow to the buyer’s account. Remember setting up a passkey earlier? This can help you transfer the assets in one click without having to feed in the multiple confirmation codes. However, never simply believe the screenshot. Confirm that you have received the amount in your account before releasing the crypto. Binance P2P buying and selling can also be initiated in cash via face-to-face transactions in specific regions. Still unsure about the Binance P2P framework? Refer to this detailed explainer to know more. It is natural for someone to change their mind midway through a P2P transaction. Regardless of the reasons, which are usually related to safety or price, here’s how to cancel a P2P order without any trouble. Do note that frequent cancellations can lead to negative feedback and may harm your reputation. If you do not want to sell crypto but the buyer has already made the payment, raise a dispute immediately. If a dispute arises due to cancellation, especially after the payment has been made, Binance’s dispute resolution system will intervene. It’s important to communicate clearly and provide valid reasons for cancellation in such cases. A Binance P2P merchant enjoys a host of perks. Note that not everyone can qualify. Here are the steps to become eligible: Notice how the requirements for becoming a merchant are pretty steep. If you are a frequent, high-volume trader, it is advisable to get merchant status. Also, it is worth mentioning that there are other Binance alternatives like OKX and more, which may have more lenient merchant programs. If you are looking to buy and sell crypto peer-to-peer, you might also want to consider those avenues. 🚀 Join Dustin as he shares on "How to safely use P2P". Worry no more when using P2P as Bybit has simple yet secure measures in place for all your transactions. 💫 Join now to become the Bybit Trader of the Year: https://t.co/nd5lYCVSlQ #BybitTraderof2024 #BybitVIP pic.twitter.com/3mVipMbQkg There is no shortage of competitors to Binance P2P. As outlined above, several leading global exchanges like OKX, Bybit, and more offer peer-to-peer trading services. Yet, learning the ins and outs of Binance’s peer-to-peer trading space is a smart move, considering the sheer popularity and user volume associated with the service. Note that Binance P2P trading is not just about following the steps and remembering guidelines. The trick is to continue executing trades until you are comfortable with the process and able to perfect every move while ensuring your assets remain safe and secure as you learn. Binance US doesn’t offer peer-to-peer trading services due to regulatory concerns. Currently, Binance US operates primarily as a crypto-only exchange and does not directly support fiat transactions for buying crypto. Users can deposit cryptocurrencies into their Binance US account and engage in crypto-to-crypto transactions to manage their digital assets. The Indian Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) has taken measures to block the URLs of Binance and several other crypto exchanges due to their failure to comply with India’s anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. The FIU issued formal notices to these entities, highlighting their non-compliance with mandatory record-keeping and suspicious transaction reporting as required under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). These actions are part of a wider initiative to ensure that all financial operators, including those located abroad but active in India, adhere strictly to local AML standards. Binance P2P does not charge users for buying or selling on its platform, which includes a variety of payment methods. This fee exemption makes Binance P2P an attractive option for those looking to buy crypto or sell crypto directly with others. The platform uses an escrow service to secure transactions, holding the cryptocurrency until both parties confirm the transaction, which enhances the security and reliability of Binance P2P trading. However, in countries like India, where TDS is implemented on every sell-side transaction, the platform might levy fees upfront, to be borne by the sellers. To buy crypto on Binance, you must get yourself verified, put out an advertisement if needed, or directly connect with the seller by relying on Binance’s order matching system. Binance P2P buying is a good way to on-ramp. Also, you can buy crypto like Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and more as well as USDT. Binance P2P selling lets you sell USDT or any other crypto, including Bitcoin (BTC) and some of the more popular picks for fiat. You can simply connect with the buyers automatically to sell crypto or search for the best price and buyer feedback manually before proceeding.

If you own or intend to buy Polkadot (DOT), you must find an appropriate Polkadot wallet to store your assets. This guide looks at the top Polkadot wallets that combine security, usability, and robust features to improve your crypto experience in 2024. Ledger is a type of hardware wallet designed to provide high-level security for storing and managing digital assets. These devices store user’s private keys in a secure hardware device, making it very difficult for hackers to access the keys even if a user’s computer is compromised. Ledger wallets are designed with security at the forefront and have received certifications for their security standards. These cold wallets also support staking and connect seamlessly with Ledger Live, an app that facilitates seamless asset management. • Secure chip technology: Ledger wallets utilize secure chip technology to safeguard your private keys and device PIN. This technology is similar to that used in credit cards and passports, providing tamper-resistant protection of your assets. • Multi-currency support: Ledger wallets support a wide variety of cryptocurrencies and digital assets, allowing users to manage multiple assets on a single device. This includes popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many others, as well as a range of altcoins and tokens. • Integration with Ledger Live: The Ledger Live software allows users to manage their cryptocurrencies from their computer or mobile device, offering an intuitive interface for checking balances, sending and receiving funds, and staking cryptocurrencies directly from the software. • Backup and restoration: Each Ledger wallet comes with a recovery phrase setup, which is used to recover your assets in case the device is lost or damaged. This phrase needs to be stored securely as it provides access to your funds. SafePal is a cryptocurrency hardware wallet supported by Binance Labs, the venture arm of the Binance cryptocurrency exchange. SafePal offers a secure and user-friendly way to store, manage, and trade various cryptocurrencies without exposing your private keys to potential online threats. Designed to be both accessible and functional, SafePal provides several key features that appeal to a broad range of crypto users, from beginners to experienced traders. • Self-destruct mechanism: SafePal wallets are designed with a self-destruct mechanism that wipes the device if malicious attempts to open or hack the device are detected. This ensures protection against physical tampering. • Mobile application: SafePal offers a mobile app that integrates seamlessly with its hardware wallet, facilitating easy management of assets on the go. The app includes features like trading, swapping, and tracking market trends. • Secure element: The SafePal S1 hardware wallet is equipped with a secure element chip that stores private keys in a highly secure environment, protecting them from both physical and electronic attacks. • Air-gapped security: SafePal utilizes QR code technology for data transmission, which eliminates the need for a wired or Bluetooth connection. This air-gapped feature significantly enhances security by minimizing the attack vectors. Polkawallet is designed to interact with the Substrate framework, which underpins the Polkadot network. Substrate is a blockchain-building framework developed by Parity Technologies, which is also used to develop Polkadot and its parachains. The mobile wallet specifically aims to provide users with a convenient and secure way to manage their DOT and interact with the Polkadot network. • Cross-chain message passing (XCMP): Polkawallet supports XCMP, enabling transactions and interactions between various parachains directly from the mobile wallet. • Governance participation: The wallet alerts users to new referendums or proposals, offering an intuitive and convenient way to view details and participate in governance. • Staking: Polkawallet provides a user-friendly dashboard designed for both validators and nominators, simplifying the process of contributing to the network’s security and governance. • Offline signature: Utilized as an observation wallet, Polkawallet remains connected to the internet for functionality without storing private keys, enhancing security. Enkrypt wallet is a browser extension wallet developed by MyEtherWallet (MEW). It’s designed to be compatible with both EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and Substrate-based blockchains. This compatibility allows users to interact seamlessly with Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains, as well as with Substrate-based chains like Polkadot, Kusama, Acala, and others. • Manage tokens and NFTs: Allows for the storage and management of various digital assets, including tokens and NFTs. • Token swaps and asset bridging: Facilitates the swapping of tokens and bridging of assets between different blockchain networks. • Purchase crypto with bank card Enables users to buy cryptocurrencies directly using their bank cards. • Manage multiple accounts: Supports the management of multiple accounts across different networks from a single interface. • Connect to web3 applications: Provides seamless integration with Web3 apps, allowing users to interact with decentralized applications easily. SubWallet is a browser extension wallet designed specifically for the Substrate and Polkadot ecosystems, offering a range of functionalities tailored to these networks. It provides an interface for users to manage their digital assets, interact with decentralized applications (DApps), and participate in the network activities of Substrate-based and Polkadot-related blockchains. • Support for multiple networks: SubWallet is compatible with various Substrate-based chains including, Polkadot, Kusama, and other parachains, facilitating easy switches between these networks within the wallet. • Asset management: Users can manage, send, and receive multiple types of assets, including tokens and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) across supported networks. • Staking and governance: Offers tools for staking and participating in the governance processes of Polkadot and other Substrate-based networks, allowing users to stake their tokens directly from the wallet and vote on proposals and referenda. • DApp interaction: Integrates seamlessly with various DApps on the Substrate ecosystem, enabling users to interact with these applications directly through the wallet. Here’s a quick comparison chart outlining the key features of the listed Polkadot wallets, as well as the respective security levels, user interface ratings, and staking capabilities of each. DOT is the native coin of the Polkadot blockchain. Gavin Wood, best known for co-founding Ethereum, created the network. Polkadot is a layer-0 protocol, meaning it is the foundational layer for an ecosystem of blockchains. Substrate-based chains are designed to connect with Polkadot. Some of these include Moonbeam and Acala. In mid-May 2024, Polkadot’s market cap was just over $9 billion. Users can stake or delegate (nominate) DOT to earn rewards for securing the platform. The minimum DOT required to become a nominator may change over time; however, the current minimum in 2024 is 554.256 DOT. When choosing a wallet, consider the following key aspects: When choosing a wallet, a few features stand out as must-haves. Whether you choose a software, hardware, or mobile wallet, make sure it supports DOT staking, has strong security measures, and is easy to use. Hardware wallets for DOT provide cold storage solutions, making them less vulnerable to online threats. Look for options that support multiple cryptocurrencies and have a proven track record of security. Software wallets offer convenience, while mobile wallets for DOT add the benefit of managing your assets on the go. These are typically hot wallets, which are connected to the internet. For optimal security, consider non-custodial wallets that give you full control over your private keys. For those interested in earning rewards through staking, choosing a wallet that supports Polkadot staking is essential. These wallets should offer a straightforward process for staking and un-staking DOT, along with clear information on staking rewards and timeframes. Self-custodial wallets, also known as non-custodial wallets, allow you full control over your crypto assets. There are no intermediaries between you and your DOT, significantly reducing the risk of third-party mishaps. JP Richardson, CEO of Exodus, emphasized the importance of self-custodial wallets in a discussion about the origins of his company. Richardson recalled the precarious nature of cryptocurrency exchanges back in 2015, a time when many such platforms were collapsing. We started Exodus back in 2015, and the reason we started Exodus was we were looking at all of the exchanges that had collapsed… At that moment in time, in 2015, if you wanted to have a diverse portfolio of crypto assets, the only place that you could actually do that was an exchange. This observation underscores the need for self-custodial solutions that provide secure and diversified asset management away from the vulnerabilities associated with exchanges. Furthermore, these wallets facilitate direct engagement with the Polkadot blockchain, crucial for activities like staking and governance. Additionally, self-custodial wallets enhance privacy since your financial activities are decentralized and not monitored by a central authority. This setup aligns with the fundamental ethos of blockchain technology — promoting autonomy and security. By choosing a self-custodial wallet, you are also less likely to be impacted by the regulatory or operational changes that can impact custodial wallet providers, ensuring more consistent access to your funds. Remember the risks of custodial exchanges and wallets. As 2014 Bitcoiners know, Mt Gox funds are still tied up in bankruptcy court. https://t.co/eLzZW3hJz5 Creating a Polkadot wallet involves a few simple steps. Here’s what it looks like with Enkrypt. 1. Choose your wallet type: Decide between hardware, software, or mobile based on your needs. 2. Download/Install the wallet: Visit the official website or app store to download your chosen wallet. Ensure you are accessing a secure and official source. 3. Create and backup your wallet: Create and securely store your backup phrases in multiple locations. This is crucial for recovery in case of device loss or failure. 4. Transfer DOT to your wallet: After setting up, transfer DOT from an exchange or another wallet to your new Polkadot wallet. Choosing the right Polkadot wallet requires a balance of security, convenience, and functionality. As the Polkadot ecosystem grows and the crypto market evolves, having a reliable and secure DOT wallet will ensure you are well-positioned to take advantage of all Polkadot offers. Remember, the ultimate goal is to protect your digital assets while making the most of the innovative features of the Polkadot blockchain. Always prioritize crypto wallet security, and ensure you only ever click official links. The best Polkadot wallet depends on your personal needs. It is generally advised to use hardware wallets like Ledger or SafePal to store your cryptocurrency. This is because hardware wallets take extra precautions to safely manage your private keys. You can store Polkadot coins on any compatible wallet. Some of the popular wallets include Polkawallet, Subwallet, and Enkrypt. You can also store Polkadot in hardware wallets like Ledger or SafePal. You can get a Polkadot wallet by going to the official Polkadot website and searching for wallets. There are many wallets that accept Polkadot and Substrate blockchains. However, only a few offer ecosystem specific features like staking or voting. It is important to only use wallets that have a proven track record of safety. Non-custodial and open-source wallets are a preferred method of crypto storage. Keep in mind that poor operational security can mitigate any safety measures provided by safe wallets. A Polkadot wallet is secure if it is non-custodial, has secure random number generation, and properly stores private keys. Wallet users can recognize good wallets by searching for reviews and looking for audits. Additionally, it is advised to use open source wallets, where the community can assess the safety themselves. Users can choose the best wallet for staking DOT by first choosing a wallet that offers staking. Thereafter, you choose the wallet by security features, such as non-custodial biometric verification, address whitelisting, pin codes, and other security features. Beyond this, you can choose a wallet that fits your specific needs and wants. Substrate compatible wallets allow you to store Polkadot and equivalent chains. This includes Kusama, Acala, Moonbeam, and others. Some wallets also allow you to hold non-Substrate cryptocurrencies, but they may not offer the staking and governance features.

To learn more on how we evaluate each piece of content, please proceed to our verification methodology page When stepping into a web3 job or any high-tech industry, it’s crucial to negotiate your salary. This ensures fair compensation when accepting a new job offer and helps set expectations for your skills and contributions. This guide offers strategies for negotiating salary expectations, ensuring you secure a compensation package that reflects your true value. These tactics will help prepare you to navigate salary discussions with confidence. Discussing your salary is pivotal, especially when transitioning into new fields like web3 jobs or moving from non-tech jobs to tech roles. These discussions also promote workplace transparency, especially in web3, where standard compensation packages are still being developed. Importantly, clear salary discussions aid in personal financial planning, which may benefit people who are transitioning careers. This issue of fair compensation also intertwines with the gender pay gap, often due to different negotiation tactics between genders. A study by the Pew Research Center indicates that most U.S. workers, except those self-employed, did not negotiate for higher pay than their last job initially offered. Nevertheless, men are slightly more likely than women to have asked for higher pay, with 32% of men versus 28% of women reporting they negotiated for more than the offer. This disparity highlights the importance of encouraging proactive salary discussions across all sectors to reduce discrepancies and ensure a more equal working environment. Securing the salary you deserve requires a well-prepared approach to negotiation. Here are a few steps to get you started: Before you even start negotiating, it’s essential to have a clear understanding of what your skills are worth in the current market. This involves researching salary ranges for web3 jobs and similar positions within your geographic area and industry. Websites like Glassdoor, PayScale, and LinkedIn Salary can provide insights into what others in your field earn. Next, a thorough self-assessment is equally important. List your skills, experiences, and accomplishments, especially those rare and in high demand. This will help you understand your market worth and enable you to articulate these during negotiations. Once you have a clear picture of the market and your worth, set a realistic salary target based on this data. Setting a range rather than a single figure is often useful, giving you flexibility and room to negotiate. When negotiating salaries, especially in web3, tailor your pitch to highlight how your unique skills and experiences align with the company’s needs and goals. Be prepared to discuss specific examples of how your contributions could benefit the organization, perhaps by mentioning similar accomplishments or demonstrating an understanding of new technologies and trends in web3. Using concrete data to demonstrate your value can be highly persuasive. For instance, if you’ve led projects that exceeded goals or significantly improved efficiencies, quantify these achievements in terms of time, money saved, or revenue generated. “When negotiating, highlight your skills and how they align with the role, and be clear about which parts of the package you are discussing, including salary, benefits, and work flexibility. Always aim for a mutually beneficial agreement and keep the door open for future discussions as you demonstrate your value.” Timing can significantly impact the outcome of your salary negotiation. Ideally, discussions about salary should come after you’ve received a job offer but before you accept it. This is when you have the most leverage, as the company has already indicated they want you but hasn’t locked down the terms of your employment. When discussing salary, avoid admitting to being underpaid. Instead, convey that you're highly sought after. Frame it so that compensation seems secondary, showcasing your market desirability. Regardless of how negotiations unfold, maintaining a professional demeanor is crucial. This not only helps preserve your current relationships within the company but also sets a positive tone that could benefit your future interactions. It’s often advantageous to ask for a slightly higher salary than your target. This gives you some room to maneuver during negotiations and can result in a higher final offer than initially anticipated. Remember, salary is just one part of your compensation package. Benefits such as health insurance, retirement contributions, flexible working conditions, and professional development opportunities can also be negotiated and add significant value to your package. Arina Kogalenok, HR Director at BeInCrypto, highlights the importance of taking an extra step in your career, be it in web3 or any tech role: “I had an employee who took the initiative to outline a set of tasks he would like to take on in addition to his current role and indicated the desired salary level for this work. This greatly facilitated my decision-making process regarding his promotion. I view this approach as highly professional and would be happy to discuss options with such an individual.” Be prepared for potential objections and have appropriate responses on standby. This might include justifications for your salary request based on your research or alternative compensation options if the employer cannot meet your salary expectations. If the salary offered is non-negotiable, consider other areas where you can agree on beneficial terms, such as a sign-on bonus, extra vacation time, or remote work days. Securing an appropriate salary requires preparation, strategic timing, and clear communication. Understanding and articulating your value can enhance your chances of securing a compensation package that reflects your worth, especially in the web3 sector. Negotiation is not just about pushing for more but about finding a mutually beneficial agreement that fosters long-term career fulfillment and growth. Researching industry standards for your role and assessing your experience and achievements can help you establish a realistic salary range. If your counteroffer significantly exceeds the initial offer, consider revising it and inquiring about future growth opportunities within the company. Negotiating rather than accepting the first offer outright is advisable, as initial offers often include some room for negotiation. Ultimately, it’s important to follow your intuition, and if you feel the need to do so, you can ask for advice from a close friend or colleague in the same industry. If the salary is fixed, you can still negotiate other aspects of your compensation, like benefits, work flexibility, or a signing bonus. However, the scope of negotiation may vary depending on the conversation’s context, so it’s crucial to gauge the discussion’s tone and flow. Even in conservative sectors, using a factual and data-driven approach to demonstrate your value can bolster your negotiation. Tailor your tactics to emphasize mutual benefits, rather than making bold demands.

To learn more on how we evaluate each piece of content, please proceed to our verification methodology page Vitalik Buterin has played a major role in the crypto space as the co-founder of Ethereum. Buterin’s vision and technical expertise have not only brought success to the Ethereum network but also helped to shape the entire blockchain landscape. Read on to learn about Buterin and his contributions and visions for the future of Ethereum. Vitalik Buterin is the co-founder of the Ethereum network, a decentralized blockchain and development platform. Born in Kolomma, Russia, on Jan. 31, 1994, Vitalik’s family left for Canada to seek better employment opportunities. At the time they left, he was six years old. Vitalik Buterin’s skills saw him enrolled in a gifted program in the third grade at a Canadian primary school. He had distinct programming skills and an early interest in economics. Buterin demonstrated remarkable mathematical prowess. Despite his academic talents, he was distant from social events and extracurricular activities, earning him the reputation of a math prodigy. Outside academics, Buterin enjoyed playing World of Warcraft from 2007 to 2010. However, his experience with the game was altered when the game’s developer, Blizzard, nerfed his highly prized favorite character. That was when he realized flaws in centralized systems, prompting him to quit. Following high school, Buterin enrolled at the University of Waterloo, pursuing advanced courses and serving as a research assistant for Ian Goldberg, a known cryptographer. Goldberg, known for co-creating Off-the-Record Messaging and his involvement with the Tor Project, mentored Buterin during this time. In 2012, Buterin achieved further recognition by winning the bronze medal at the International Olympiad in Informatics held in Italy. Vitalik’s net worth primarily stems from his cryptocurrency holdings, which reportedly exceed $866 million at the current market value. Notably, most of his wealth is attributed to his ETH holdings. Buterin holds a substantial amount of ETH, totaling 278,426 ETH and 248 WETH ($919K). This makes him one of the largest holders of ETH, constituting approximately 0.23% of all ETH in circulation. However, determining Buterin’s exact net worth is challenging due to undisclosed non-crypto assets and potential undisclosed crypto holdings. Vitalik Buterin has achieved a lot throughout his career. In 2014, Buterin was awarded the Thiel Fellowship, a prestigious grant that allowed him to focus on developing Ethereum. The following year, Buterin’s groundbreaking work on Ethereum earned him the World Technology Award in the IT Software category. This award celebrated his contributions to technology and innovation, solidifying his reputation as a visionary within the industry. In addition, Buterin was included in Fortune magazine’s esteemed “40 under 40” list in 2016, acknowledging his leadership and impact as a young innovator. In June 2017, Vitalik Buterin met with Russian President Vladimir Putin during the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. The meeting was aimed at discussing the economic significance of Ethereum for Russia. In 2018, Buterin received further recognition for his achievements. Forbes featured him in its “30 under 30” list, highlighting his exceptional accomplishments and potential across various industries. He was also honored with an honorary doctorate from the University of Basel for his contributions to blockchain and Ethereum. Buterin’s influence in the cryptocurrency and blockchain sector was further underscored by his inclusion in Fortune’s “The Ledger 40 under 40” list. His impact also went beyond industry boundaries, as evidenced by his inclusion in Time magazine’s prestigious Time 100 list in 2021, which honored him for his contributions to technology and cryptocurrencies on a global scale. In 2018, the Ethereum community celebrated Buterin’s dedication and contributions with the Vitalik Buterin Community Award. This acknowledgment recognized his unparalleled commitment to advancing the Ethereum ecosystem and fostering its growth and development. Vitalik Buterin’s philanthropic efforts have been quite transparent. In October, Buterin clarified on his social platforms that when articles suggest that he is selling ETH, the transactions are made by charities, non-profits, or other projects to cover fees associated with his donations. He added that he has not sold any ETH for personal gains since 2018. In 2021, Buterin donated over $1 billion in crypto to various charities, including the India Covid Relief fund. The funds came from selling dog-themed meme coins he was gifted by the creators of Akita Inu (AKITA), Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogelon (ELON). Buterin established Kanro, his charitable entity, to combat pandemics, focusing on addressing the challenges posed by COVID-19. Currently, Kanro’s publicly known address holds approximately 75 million USDC stablecoins. Vitalik Buterin donated USD 1.5 billion in cryptocurrency According to Jutel this was a demonstrative gesture of the legitimacy game that encompasses crypto-speculators, blockchain humanitarians and technology solution developers. https://t.co/btR0rodtgj pic.twitter.com/bktHOqJf5u In addition to Kanro, Buterin has made donations, primarily in ether. Some recipients were 13,292 ETH to GiveWell, a charity evaluator, 1,000 ETH, and 430 billion ELON tokens to the Methuselah Foundation, which is focused on extending the human lifespan. He also donated 1050 ETH to the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, which aims at safe AI technologies. Vitalik Buterin is primarily known as the co-founder of Ethereum, the second-largest crypto by market cap. Since launching Ethereum, Vitalik has remained a central figure in its development. He is the platform’s public face, contributes to its technical direction, and advocates for its adoption. Buterin also has a background in computer science. His programming skills were instrumental in building Ethereum, and he continues to be a thought leader and advisor in blockchain technology. Apart from that, as outlined above, Vitalik has been involved in charitable contributions, particularly medical research and global health initiatives. Vitalik Buterin is important for co-founding Ethereum. Ethereum introduced smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements that have opened doors to various applications beyond just crypto. Beyond Ethereum, Buterin is a prominent figure in blockchain and crypto. His technical knowledge and vision for the future of the technology are widely respected. At 30, Buterin has become a significant figure in the crypto industry, often compared to Satoshi Nakamoto in significance. His contributions have solidified his position as a key player in shaping the future of the crypto space. In 2011, seeking a new direction, Buterin stumbled upon Bitcoin. Initially skeptical due to its lack of physical backing, he gradually became intrigued as he looked deeper into its workings and potential. Desiring to participate actively in this sector, Buterin looked to acquire Bitcoin but lacked the resources to mine or purchase them outright. Instead, he turned to online forums, where he began writing articles for a blog, earning approximately 5 BTC per piece. ➫ Vitalik Buterin created $ETH at 19, and now his net worth is over $1.2B, making him the youngest crypto billionaire according to Forbes He is one of the most influential people in crypto, so knowing his views can help predict the future I've watched ~100 hours of his… pic.twitter.com/cPDw6W8JwE Buterin explored crypto’s economic, technological, and political dimensions. His writings caught the attention of Mihai Alisie, a fellow Bitcoin enthusiast based in Romania. This led to the creation of the Bitcoin Magazine, which Buterin co-founded in late 2011. Juggling writing, travel, and crypto work for over 30 hours weekly, Buterin decided to leave university. Buterin traveled the world researching various altcoins. He deduced that existing projects were too narrowly focused and lacked versatility. Buterin believed that a successful blockchain should have more applications and more adaptability. He recognized the potential for generalizing the protocols already in place and used Turing-complete programming languages to develop the idea of Ethereum. Despite initial rejections from existing projects, he created the network and wrote the Ethereum whitepaper. In early 2014, Buterin collaborated with a group of visionaries, including Gavin Wood, Anthony Di Iorio, Charles Hoskinson, and Joseph Lubin, to establish Ethereum. Together, they initiated an initial coin offering (ICO) campaign to finance the platform’s development, offering ETH coins in exchange for contributions. The campaign exceeded expectations, raising over $18 million in Bitcoin. With the funding, Ethereum began developing the platform, focusing on enabling smart contracts and decentralized applications. Ethereum introduced Solidity, a new programming language for writing smart contracts. In July 2015, Ethereum launched the Frontier network, its initial implementation. Since then, the ETH ecosystem has undergone multiple upgrades, including the Metropolis, Constantinople, Istanbul hard forks, and the Ethereum Merge, enhancing its capabilities and scalability. Vitalik Buterin has encountered several technical challenges throughout Ethereum’s development. Ethereum is a complex, secure, and scalable platform that has had technical challenges. Some of these that Buterin has addressed are ensuring smart contract security, achieving scalability in handling high transaction volumes, and balancing decentralization with efficiency. Since everything on a public blockchain is transparent, user privacy has also been a major point of discussion. Balancing the need for transparency with the desire for anonymity has been an ongoing effort. The Ethereum blockchain developed use cases such as decentralized applications (DApps) and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). However, it faced a significant setback with the launch of the DAO in April 2016. Intended to revolutionize crowdfunding, the DAO quickly raised around $150 million in ETH. However, vulnerabilities in its codebase led to an exploit, resulting in the theft of 3.6 million ETH, roughly $50 million at the time. In response, Vitalik Buterin decided to fork the Ethereum network to stop the hack and restore the stolen funds. The inability to reconcile these differences led to the Ethereum blockchain splitting into two separate chains: Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). Ethereum moved forward with the fork to recover the stolen funds, while Ethereum Classic remained on the original blockchain. ETH became more popular over time and attracted the support of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, which had over 200 members, including JP Morgan and Citigroup. Vitalik Buterin recognized that Ethereum’s proof-of-work (PoW) version led to soaring Ethereum gas fees, making transactions too expensive for many users. This delay prompted Buterin to acknowledge that Ethereum’s transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism would take six years instead of the projected one. To address the need for improved transaction throughput and congestion management, Ethereum adopted sharding as part of the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade (Merge). Sharding divides the network into shard chains, distributing the load and aiming to boost transaction throughput and relieve congestion. The Merge integrated Ethereum’s original mainnet with its new proof-of-stake Beacon Chain. This transition eliminated energy-intensive mining and enabled the network to be secured through staked ETH. However, Buterin and his team’s adoption of a more centralized approach has departed from the decentralized strategy previously favored by Ethereum community members. In addition, holders’ expectations have shifted, viewing ETH as an investment asset rather than a decentralized currency. Did you know? The name Ethereum was inspired by a medieval theory about an invisible, all-pervasive substance called “ether.” In a student testimonial at Abelard School, Vitalik Buterin reiterated his experience working on Ethereum and in the crypto industry in general: “I am truly grateful to have the opportunity to work in such an interesting and interdisciplinary area of industry, where I have the chance to interact with cryptographers, mathematicians, and economists prominent in their fields to help build software and tools that already affect tens of thousands of people around the world and to work on advanced problems in computer science, economics, and philosophy every week.” Buterin’s involvement in blockchain projects beyond Ethereum, like L4 and Plasma Group, signals his interest in contributing to the emerging metaverse. In a July 2022 post on X, Buterin criticized Meta Platform’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, suggesting corporate attempts to create the metaverse might fail. Buterin believes it’s too early to define the metaverse and that any current attempts may misfire. Given Ethereum’s role as the foundation for various developments such as DeFi, NFTs, and stablecoins, it’s unsurprising that Buterin expects the network to lead in the metaverse space. The "metaverse" is going to happen but I don't think any of the existing corporate attempts to intentionally create the metaverse are going anywhere. https://t.co/tVUfq4CWmP Buterin also sees the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) ecosystem as providing web3 usernames for crypto addresses and decentralized websites and enabling cross-platform identities for users and items. He believes ENS offers solutions that many people overlook. Buterin is fascinated by Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs), a cryptographic proof allowing a party to prove possession of specific information without revealing it. This eliminates the need for interaction between the prover and verifier. Buterin predicts zk-SNARKs will become the most widely used privacy-preserving technology in the next three decades. He calls it a potential revolution as it becomes mainstream in the next 10-20 years. Buterin has outlined future plans for Ethereum, such as implementing sharding for scalability (the Surge), introducing Verkle trees for efficiency (the Verge), reducing storage requirements (the Purge), and enhancing quantum resistance (the Splurge). Ethereum operates as a decentralized blockchain platform built by developers worldwide. No single entity controls it. While the Ethereum Foundation was important in creating the initial infrastructure and continues to support development, control over the network has shifted to the larger Ethereum community. Ethereum’s decentralized governance model ensures that no single entity or individual can unilaterally change the platform, including the Ethereum Foundation or Vitalik Buterin. Instead, decisions are made collectively by the community, which includes developers, node operators, and ETH holders. The network’s success relies on the participation of the community members. They perform activities such as staking and securing the network through node operations and ETH holdings. With hundreds of thousands of developers contributing to the platform’s ongoing development, Ethereum remains a decentralized and collaborative ecosystem. Ethereum Improvement Proposals, or EIPs, allow the community to propose improvements to the network. Any crypto community member can submit EIPs via GitHub. Once proposed, they undergo discussion and review by the Ethereum community, including editors, for approval. In addition, forum members and Ethereum enthusiasts engage in discussions, providing feedback to the proposal’s author. EIPs can cover various aspects of the Ethereum network. An example of is changes to the ERC-20 technical standard, which governs Ethereum transactions. Vitalik Buterin has played a significant role in Ethereum’s development and evolution. As co-founder and leader, he has spearheaded updates such as Ethereum 2.0, which transitioned the network to proof-of-stake and propelled Ethereum to the forefront of the blockchain revolution. Beyond Ethereum contributions, Buterin’s commitment to innovation has been a driver in transforming the blockchain space.  Vitalik Buterin’s inspiration for Ethereum started when the developer changed his character in World of Warcraft, highlighting the downsides of centralized control. In addition, while impressed with Bitcoin and other projects in the crypto industry, he envisioned a platform that would be adaptable and have more applications.Hence, Ethereum was created as a blockchain that facilitates the creation of decentralized applications (DApps) using smart contracts, among other use cases. Vitalik Buterin introduced Ethereum, which opened doors for decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other applications beyond digital currencies. Vitalik’s ongoing research, writing, and public speaking have also shaped the conversation around blockchain technology. Vitalik Buterin’s awards include recognition for his technical contributions (Thiel Fellowship, World Technology Award), leadership in the tech industry (Fortune 40 under 40, Forbes 30 under 30), and influence within the blockchain space (Honorary Doctorate, Fortune the ledger 40 under 40, Vitalik Buterin Community Award). Time Magazine even recognized him for his global impact on technology and cryptocurrency. Vitalik remains a prominent figure in Ethereum’s development. He is key in shaping its roadmap and proposing solutions for technical challenges like scalability and privacy. His ideas and research papers on scalability solutions (sharding) and Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanisms influence conversations around the blockchain space. Vitalik Buterin’s future vision for Ethereum includes implementing sharding for scalability (the Surge), introducing Verkle trees for efficiency (the Verge), reducing storage requirements (the Purge), and enhancing quantum resistance (the Splurge). Vitalik Buterin is most famous for co-founding Ethereum, a leading blockchain platform that introduced smart contracts. He is also recognized for his philanthropy and advocacy for decentralization in the blockchain space. In May 2024, Vitalik’s net worth is estimated to be around $866 million at the current market value. The majority of this is from his Ethereum collection. While the information on Vitalik Buterin’s IQ has never been released officially, several sources cite 257. Notably, an IQ level above 130 is considered high. Hence, Buterin’s IQ, which is almost twice that, is very high. Ethereum’s top holders are mostly crypto exchanges, including Binance with 7.2 million ETH and Huobi with 3.3 million ETH. Other major holders include the Ethereum Foundation, with 2.9 million ETH. Meanwhile, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is one of the largest individual holders, with 278K ETH. Vitalik Buterin is widely recognized as the Ethereum co-founder, with others like Gavin Wood, Anthony Di Iorio, Charles Hoskinson, and Joseph Lubin playing major roles in the project’s early development. Vitalik Buterin reportedly has 278,524 ETH (~$1M) and 256 WETH ($919K), making him one of the largest ETH holders. In May 2024, Vitalik’s net worth is estimated to be around $866 million at the current market value.

Binance P2P is an example of this — the platform has become a risky terrain for many P2P traders. Binance P2P scams are on the rise, with even the most experienced peer-to-peer professionals succumbing to fraudsters’ traps every so often. This guide covers every type of Binance P2P scam in detail, with real examples and concrete and foolproof steps to navigate them. Here’s how to stay safe on Binance P2P. Scams are rife in decentralized ecosystems, and the Binance P2P trading platform is not immune to such threats. The platform is designed for like-minded individuals to buy and sell Bitcoin (BTC), USDT, and other popular crypto assets directly among themselves. The centralized exchange (CEX) only acts as a facilitator; it doesn’t charge overheads and offers a simple and intuitive process for buyers and sellers alike. However, the space also plays host to a number of unscrupulous actors. In 2024, the platform is rife with individuals looking to dupe unwitting users who aim only to engage in legitimate P2P trading. An example of a suspicious request on Binance P2P: Here is a quick example of how a Binance P2P transaction is supposed to work: Throughout this guide, you will continue to encounter the A-B example to demonstrate the breadth and common themes of Binance P2P scams. If you use P2P – Please watch this video. In this video, we have discussed the Crypto Scam problem thats happening in India. Which is leading to Police enquiry & Bank Account Block. We have also discussed – The best available option to get the Bank account unblocked.… It is a common observation that most Binance P2P scams occur in developing nations. Here’s why: Here are some common Binance P2P scams you should be aware of. Scenario: A (Seller) lists an offer to sell 1 BTC for $50,000. B (Buyer) agrees to the trade and claims to have made the payment but never actually transfers the $50,000. A, believing the payment has been made, releases the BTC from the escrow service, only to realize later that the payment was never received. Actual example: In July 2023, two individuals were arrested in Ujjain, India, for running such a scam. They used counterfeit IDs and personal data to create fraudulent accounts on Binance P2P. The scammers sent fake SMS messages to sellers, mimicking bank notifications that falsely indicated the payment had been made. The unsuspecting sellers, believing the SMS notifications, release their Bitcoin (BTC) or other cryptocurrency without actually receiving the funds. The fraudsters exploited free SMS platforms to send these false messages, which resulted in significant financial losses for the victims. Beware of the consequences of crypto P2P scams: if your bank account freezes due to fraudulent activity, neither cybercrime support nor the bank will provide assistance, leaving your funds at risk. Even if you’re diligently paying crypto taxes, you’re on your own. Stay… Scenario: B (Buyer) completes the payment and receives 1 BTC from A (Seller). Later, B initiates a chargeback with the bank, reversing the $50,000 payment. A loses both the BTC and the payment. Did you know? In one reported case in Nigeria, a trader sold BTC worth approximately $5,000. The buyer made the payment using a bank transfer, and the seller, after confirming the receipt of funds, released the BTC. However, the buyer later initiated a chargeback, claiming the transaction was unauthorized. The bank reversed the transfer, and the seller lost both the BTC and the $5,000. It is not just about A and B anymore. Identity theft presents another scenario: Scenario: C (Scammer) uses a stolen identity to create a fake account and poses as either A (Seller) or B (Buyer). If C poses as A, they might disappear after B makes the payment. If C poses as B, they might scam A using fraudulent payment methods. The case of identity theft is growing in countries like India, where individuals who require funds may voluntarily sell their account info to scammers, usually Buyers, who then buy crypto from regular sellers and transfer funds. When they disappear, the person “C,” who didn’t get anything despite the promises, lodges an official complaint, and the fund tracking takes the authorities to the seller’s account. This then gets frozen, or the amount received is locked as a bank lien. A big update on crypto🇮🇳 in P2p scams: Cyber Criminal transferred money in victim account. Bank feezed victim bank account on police request. Victim cant access the account. Kerala High court to Banks: "Don't freeze the bank account only withhold disputed amount." Though not directly related to Binance, here is a real-life example of how identity theft goes down: Bryan Alan Sparks and Autumn Gail Luna used stolen identities to apply for various COVID-19 relief benefits and open bank accounts. Between March 2020 and January 2021, they used the identities of more than 50 individuals to claim approximately $1.98 million in benefits, including unemployment aid and small business loans. “In each case, scammers use common tactics. They pretend to be a trusted source, like a store or a bank. “ Scenario: B could be using illicit funds to buy BTC from A, using a P2P platform to clean the money. The idea here is simple. Scammers who have duped others try to purchase cryptocurrency from unwitting sellers, dumping the illegally procured funds in their accounts. If and when an investigation starts, it is the seller who faces the heat. In November 2023, Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) pled guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and failing to implement effective AML controls. This failure allowed money laundering activities to flourish on the platform. The Department of Justice (DOJ) found that Binance’s inadequate compliance measures facilitated illegal transactions, including those involving terrorist financing, cybercriminals, and other illicit actors. To use Binance P2P platforms safely, you should consistently follow a set of practices. This section outlines the requisite steps P2P traders must take to protect themselves. Here is a detailed thread that can help: Developing countries are seeing a rise in crypto P2P scams. This includes account-selling, SMS, and email scams. As a user, staying informed about these threats is crucial. Check this thread to #StaySafe#P2PScams #Binance #P2P #Crypto pic.twitter.com/Deo5WlnSLQ Besides the mentioned strategies, you can even connect with known users on Binance to facilitate payments. You can also: The above points represent lesser-known but solid high-level strategies to employ to avoid being scammed. If it’s already too late for protective measures, both sellers and buyers can consider legal recourse. However, while this is technically an option, it’s often a difficult path to travel. Blockchain and FinTech lawyer Pawan Laddha spoke with BeInCrypto about the practicality of utilizing legal help, particularly in countries where many aren’t aware of P2P fundamentals. “Driving the legal system for redressal in crypto P2P scam cases is an uphill battle. The lack of clear regulations and complexity of the fundamentals of peer-to-peer transactions, decentralized ledgers, and the pseudonymous nature of crypto wallets among law enforcement officials makes it incredibly challenging to seek justice. The legal status of cryptocurrencies themselves remains a gray area, with no single comprehensive legislation governing their use. Many victims find themselves trapped in a maze of account freezes and bureaucratic tangles as authorities grapple with concepts like irreversible transactions, self-custodial wallets, and the cross-border nature of blockchain networks. Unfortunately, success stories of individuals emerging victorious from such ordeals are few and far between in the current regulatory landscape.” In most cases, Binance doesn’t guarantee refunds. However, the peer-to-peer crypto exchange does work closely with law enforcement to handle scams and frauds. Also, if the scam has been initiated (willingly or unwillingly) by a Binance P2P merchant, refunds can be a potential solution. Each merchant needs to deposit at least 2000 USDT with Binance or have this amount in a funding wallet as a sign of credibility. Diving into real-life examples is one of the best ways to understand scams and the possible solutions. Here’s the experience of BeInCrypto writer Ananda Banerjee. Ananda received his January salary in crypto. In early February, he decided to off-ramp his crypto earnings — selling USD using Binance’s P2P platform. Ananda chose the Express P2P order option and was automatically matched with a buyer offering a decent price to buy USDT. After verifying that the funds came from a legitimate source and noting the buyer’s positive feedback, he completed the sale. A month later, Axis Bank, where Ananda holds his account, placed a lien on the transaction amount following a complaint from the Cyber Crime section of Gurugram, Haryana. Additionally, a similar complaint was raised from Rajkot, Gujarat. This indicated that the funds Ananda received were acquired illegally by the buyer. The complaints and the subsequent lien on Ananda’s account imply that the buyer who purchased crypto from Ananda used illicitly obtained funds. This could also be a case of identity fraud, where the verified buyer might have used someone else’s account to transfer funds. However, the situation remains unclear due to the less-than-cooperative nature of police and banking officials in India. They often do not disclose the complete report of what transaction was flagged and why it was flagged. Despite Ananda not being a trader and simply receiving his salary in crypto, police questioned how he received his funds, demonstrating a lack of understanding of international salary structures. Here is the letter Ananda received from the bank. Notice how key information isn’t disclosed: This case highlights the importance of thorough verification and cautious trading practices, even when using reputed platforms like Binance P2P. It also underscores the challenges faced by crypto users in India due to regulatory and legal ambiguities. Ananda’s scenario outline in our case study isn’t a one-off. The CryptoIndia subreddit further demonstrates the proliferation of scams on the platform across the region. Every second day, a concern is raised by those engaged in P2P trading, showcasing how precarious the situation is. But then, people are optimistic about the fix, not because the government has started to pay attention but now that Binance has agreed to adhere to the FIU guidelines. Here is what one trader had to say regarding FIU compliance: “FlU compliance itself means that you are dealing with a trusted party and the Govt can’t hold you accountable for receiving funds from a compliant counterparty. They will either remove the P2P feature or make sure it is somehow compliant. Expect more scrutiny when sending and receiving funds via the new Binance. It will definitely not be convenient, and funds might take longer to process, especially if they have doubts about the source.” While India’s P2P markets are hotbeds for scams, numerous other instances of P2P and other exchange-specific frauds have surfaced globally. Here are a few notable ones: In Nigeria, scammers frequently use fake proof of payment to deceive sellers into releasing their Bitcoin (BTC) or other cryptocurrencies. A common method involves scammers sending fake bank transfer receipts or screenshots to the seller. A seller received a fake bank notification from a scammer claiming to have transferred funds via GTBank. The seller, believing the notification to be genuine, released the BTC, only to find out later that the money was never deposited. This emphasizes the importance of verifying payment by logging into your bank account rather than trusting notifications. In Kenya, a common scam involves a man-in-the-middle attack, where the scammer intercepts communications between the buyer and seller, facilitating a fraudulent transaction. A scammer posed as both a buyer and a seller on Binance P2P. They directed a legitimate buyer to send payment to a legitimate seller while intercepting the communication. The seller, believing the payment was from the buyer, released the cryptocurrency to the scammer’s wallet. The bank involved was Equity Bank. This type of scam can be prevented by ensuring all communication is conducted within the P2P platform. In Brazil, scammers set up fake escrow services to conduct P2P transactions. These malicious actors create professional-looking websites or services that appear legitimate but are designed to steal funds. A seller agreed to use an escrow service suggested by the buyer. The service looked professional, with a well-designed website and customer support. However, after the buyer sent the payment to the fake escrow service, the seller never received the cryptocurrency, and the escrow service disappeared. Banco do Brasil was mentioned in the complaint filed by the victim. This scam underscores the importance of using only well-known and verified escrow services provided by reputable P2P platforms. In South Africa, chargeback fraud is common. Her,e scammers use reversible payment methods like credit cards to reverse payments after receiving the cryptocurrency. A seller received a payment via the First National Bank (FNB) credit card and released the cryptocurrency. A few days later, the seller was notified by the bank that the payment had been reversed due to a chargeback request from the buyer. The seller lost both the cryptocurrency and the payment, illustrating the risks associated with accepting reversible payment methods on P2P platforms. And it’s not just Binance. Other exchanges in other countries have also seen a surge in such instances. In Canada, a prevalent P2P scam involves fraudsters impersonating technical support staff from well-known cryptocurrency exchanges like NDAX or Shakepay. They contact victims through unofficial channels such as social media or messaging apps, claiming that their accounts have issues that need urgent attention. A victim received a message on Telegram from someone claiming to be NDAX support, stating there was suspicious activity on their account. The scammer asked for login credentials and remote access to their device. Once access was granted, the scammer initiated unauthorized transactions, transferring funds out of the victim’s account. This highlights the importance of only communicating through official channels and never sharing login details. If you want to try out other P2P platforms, here are some of the Binance alternatives or, rather, Binance competitors to consider: In addition to the mentioned names, you can also use other platforms, including Bisq and Paxful, to buy and sell crypto among peers. If buyers and sellers remain vigilant, scammers may begin to realize that operating successfully on this platform is no longer feasible. However, even with the strongest crypto security standards, crypto scams aren’t expected to end anytime soon. Opportunists and bad actors will likely always operate within emerging and decentralized ecosystems. To combat these threats, the focus should be on improving the quality of issue handling and legal avenues offered to those who fall victim to scammers, plus improving education and awareness around platform risk. Information is key. By being aware of the Binance P2P scams listed in this guide, users can take the necessary steps to protect themselves and their crypto assets when trading on the platform. To avoid crypto scams regarding Binance P2P buying and Binance P2P selling, you need to verify the payments, use the Binance P2P trading escrow service, communicate clearly with the other party, and even verify the counterparty details. Also, do not give out personal details or refrain from accepting third-party payments from buyers you are looking to sell Bitcoin (BTC) to. While Binance P2P offers various advantages, such as zero trading fees and a robust escrow service, it also has some issues. Despite security measures, Binance p2p scams like payment fraud, chargeback fraud, and identity theft can occur. Scammers may use fake payment proofs or stolen identities to defraud users. Users in certain regions may also face additional scrutiny from banks and regulatory bodies, which can lead to account freezes and legal complications. The reliance on a centralized escrow system means that Binance holds the funds during transactions. While this reduces scam risks, it also means users must trust Binance with their funds, which some may view as a drawback in the decentralized world of cryptocurrency. No, transactions on Binance P2P are not tax-free. The tax implications of trading on Binance P2P depend on your country’s tax laws and regulations regarding cryptocurrency transactions: If you are making a profit from Binance p2p trading, it is generally considered taxable income. This includes profits from buying and selling crypto such as BTC and USDT. In many jurisdictions, cryptocurrency transactions are subject to capital gains tax. This applies to the difference in value when you buy crypto at a lower price and sell crypto at a higher price. Countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, and India require individuals to report their cryptocurrency transactions and pay taxes accordingly. Failure to do so can result in penalties.

Many of its services are tailored for businesses and projects that require multi-step process automation. This guide covers everything you need to know about Guru Network and its native GURU token in 2024. The Guru Network is an innovative ecosystem of products and services. The network is developing an AI compute multi-chain layer for blockchain-based projects and apps looking to build or enhance AI functionality. The expansive project was initially launched as a decentralized exchange (DEXGuru Trading Terminal) and has since evolved into an all-in-one platform (Guru Network), merging real-world business processes with artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology. In 2024, the platform is a key driver in simplifying AI-focused application development and deployment. We've come a long way from being DeFi trading terminal to evolving into the Guru Network. What started as a tool for traders has transformed into a robust ecosystem for Web3 Automations and AI Compute. Let's dive into this! pic.twitter.com/mgP1uzbwyZ Guru Network provides a framework for blockchain business process automation (BBPA), which facilitates app development with minimal coding requirements. This abstracts the complexity away from its users, who, in turn, can focus on creating value for their own customers. The multi-chain AI compute layer will allow builders to natively embed orchestrated AI agents into their applications on multiple blockchains. The Guru Network contends with a number of limitations in current AI automation offerings for business. Modern-day AI models can be used for pattern recognition, natural language processing (NLP), data analysis, and many other menial tasks. However, there are a few real-world instances that expose the chinks in the armor of AI, thereby limiting its potential in business processes. For example, modern AI models struggle with automating processes that involve several stages. This makes it impractical to rely exclusively on such models in situations where objectives are complex. It’s very important to have a precise problem so that you can solve a precise problem. When you’re not clear, then it’s trying to solve a problem that you don’t even know what the problem is. Furthermore, when AI is used in large-scale operations or processes that involve multiple participants, it fails to scale. This drawback can pose significant bottlenecks in fast-paced environments. Lastly, AI systems lack confidence when interacting with real-world events and actions. This limits their potential to bridge the gap between the physical and digital realms effectively. Guru Network aims to solve some of these issues. By seamlessly merging blockchain and AI, Guru Network super-charges efficiency and ensures that applications are crucially context-aware, optimizing performance within a decentralized framework. The Guru Network offers a suite of features that enhance the functionality and efficiency of decentralized applications (DApps). These features ensure secure, scalable, and efficient operations across various sectors. The Flow Orchestrator acts as the central hub and coordinates activities across the network. It defines and dispatches business processes to the BBPA Engines and sources data from the Guru Data Warehouse, Block Explorer, and trading terminal (DexGuru). Essentially, the Guru Flow Orchestrator links AI models, on-chain processes, and off-chain data, ensuring a seamless flow of operations. This enhances efficiency and broadens the scope of DApps. This feature provides users with a minimal code development environment and a user-friendly interface that streamlines project creation and management. Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is a solution for transferring tokens and sending arbitrary message data to smart contracts on other blockchains. The integration of CCIP into Guru Network’s services ensures secure and efficient off-chain computations and data feeds. This architecture allows for improvements in scalability in sectors like finance, supply chain, and automated customer interactions. Furthermore, CCIP is functional on multiple EVM-compatible blockchains, which allows the Guru Network to expand its services to even more networks. Individual Agents on the Guru Network are similar to AWS Lambda functions. AWS Lambda functions are computing services that run code for applications in response to events or requests without the need to manage servers. Individual Agents, on the other hand, subscribe to tasks, execute various operations, and interact within the Guru Network’s economic framework. The tasks that they execute can vary widely, which may include: Missing those 2017 deep dives into crypto whitepapers? Ours isn’t the easiest read, but it’s packed with insights on how AI meets blockchain. Learn how GURU will help to make this connection seamless. Introducing the Interoperability Architecture WP:https://t.co/JiGsmtjprS pic.twitter.com/DcnUC7J4xH As previously mentioned, DexGuru is the trading terminal of the Guru Network. It was the first service offered by the network. DexGuru is a powerhouse of features, offering value to users in multiple ways. Some included elements are: These are just a few of the features offered by the trading terminal. Users can enjoy these and additional features that will aid them in on-chain analysis and trading. The Guru Network’s Block Explorer is essentially an Etherscan alternative for appchains. It offers some of the same features you see across standard block explorers, such as portfolio view, token balances, smart contract verification, and more. Some of the other advanced features it includes are tracing, an ABI Execution interface, TradingView charts, APIs for developers, and integration into EVM-compatible blockchains. These include: The Data Warehouse is an on-chain data access solution that supports data-intensive applications such as analytics, AI, and machine learning (ML). It provides advanced tools for data ingestion, visualization, and real-time streaming. With this tool, you can integrate your services with the Block Explorer, allowing for advanced data querying; utilize an AI-powered visual SQL editor; create dashboards to visualize complex data; integrate with data warehouses; use community-driven API endpoints; and more. The GURU Framework, a software development kit (SDK), is designed to streamline the development process for developing, deploying, and managing DApps. It gives users a set of tools and libraries that allow them to integrate AI into DApp development. Some of its specific features are integration with the Flow Orchestrator, access to the BBPA engines, synchronization of smart contracts across multiple blockchain networks, an API that bridges web2 and web3, the creation and management of individual agents, and the utilization of the Shared Event Bus. Several necessary participants are involved in the Guru Network, each with a unique task that creates a cohesive system for long-term sustainability. Here’s a snapshot of the setup: Users’ engagement in these roles is crucial, as it creates a feedback loop that generates value throughout the entire Guru network. This value is set to be further enhanced as governance mechanisms, hackathons, developer programs, and the Guru token enrich the ecosystem —and rewards and incentive features are rolled out. $GURU is the native token of the Guru network. It will be used for distributing revenue among many participants in the Guru ecosystem, such as contributors and stakers. As well as being a revenue distribution tool, the token will power the extensive Guru ecosystem. GURU will be utilized to pay transaction and service fees, AI usage and compute fees, Flow orchestrator fees, and more. $GURU token is about to drop. Target launch: end of May. Your best move now?

A number of projects have already integrated Guru’s services across several diverse sectors. Clear examples are Guru’s DexGuru, Block Explorer, and Data Warehouse. However, here are a few examples of other services: Guru Network is the brainchild of Evgeny Vakhteev and Nick Sawinyh. Sawinyh has over a decade of experience in growing and developing applications in the blockchain, crypto, and web3 space. He also has experience as a product and marketing leader and formerly founded Defiprime. Vakhleev is the current CTO of DexGuru, a trading terminal apart of the Guru Network. He has former experience as a software developer at Hulu and an even longer history as the CEO of multiple companies. Some of the other team members include: The DexGuru platform has raised at least $6 million in capital across two funding rounds. The first round, led by ParaFi Capital, raised $1 million. The second round amassed $5 million from familiar faces like Huobi, Wintermute, and Sandeep Nailwal and over a dozen other angel investors, companies, and firms. Some of these include: These investments have allowed the GURU Network to expand from its humble beginnings as a simple EVM-compatible trading terminal to the expansive platform that it is in 2024. In the first quarter of 2024, the project focused on access to the community and early adopters, the Phase 1 testnet for the Block Explorer and Data Warehouse, and the introduction of the Web3 Automation and AI platform. Q1 to Q2 also saw the synchronization of the BBPA Engine and Chainlink’s CCIP. This period will also see a token generation event, the implementation of the Fjord Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool, the launch of the Base Layer 3 testnet, and the launch of the Individual Agents platform. Q2 to Q3 will see the launch of hackathons and community evangelism. Advancements in the AI compute layer will be seen in the third quarter of 2024. The Guru Network will also establish itself as a sync layer, compute for private chains, and decentralize the BBPA Engines and Flow Orchestrator. The Guru Network is a comprehensive platform that bridges the off-chain and on-chain world. It utilizes the innovations of artificial intelligence and blockchain to automate tasks and propel the business world into the future. This allows developers and founders to do what they do best and focus on creating value for their customers. Through its Guru Framework SDK, Data Warehouse, Guru Layer 3, and many other services, this expanding ecosystem offers a valuable service to businesses, projects, and developers in web3 and beyond. Guru Network is a platform that integrates blockchain and artificial technology. It is an ecosystem of services that automates multi-step tasks, particularly for businesses developing decentralized applications. Guru also has a layer-3 built using the Base stack. The GURU token is the incentive layer of the Guru Network. It is sued to bootstrap many of the services on the Guru network. Users can stake, trade, yield farm, and use the token for many other actions. There are multiple participants in the Guru ecosystem. Gurus and Individual Agents are incentivized through collecting fees from services rendered. Ecosystem projects and retail users can also earn through various means as well.

To learn more on how we evaluate each piece of content, please proceed to our verification methodology page Charles Hoskinson is a prolific figure in the cryptocurrency industry. He’s among the original Ethereum co-founders, having worked alongside Vitalik Buterin and others to build Ethereum. Hoskinson also briefly served as the Ethereum CEO before a fallout that saw him leave the Ethereum network to build Cardano, a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain. Read on to learn who Charles Hoskinson is, what he does, why he is important, and some of the challenges he has experienced. Charles Hoskinson is an American mathematician and tech entrepreneur in the web3 space. He was born in Hawaii, USA, in 1987 to a family of doctors. Hoskinson initially toyed with following in his parents’ footsteps to study medicine. However, he later chartered his path and instead chose to study mathematics. Charles Hoskinson began his academic journey at the Metropolitan State University of Denver, where he earned a degree in analytic number theory. He then enrolled for a Master’s in Mathematics at the University of Colorado Boulder. Hoskinson later enrolled for his PhD but dropped out before he could graduate and joined Ron Paul’s 2008 presidential campaign. Paul’s libertarian views fueled Hoskinson’s decision to join his campaign. Hoskinson was fascinated by Austrian economics and monetary theory, which argued that an economic system founded on fiat currency is essentially unstable, worked. Something that Bitcoin, the first digital currency, attempted to address. Given that the crypto market is volatile, it’s difficult to get the exact net worth of prolific figures in the space, including Hoskinson. This is because his net worth is directly connected to his crypto holdings, and a large chunk of it is linked to the value of the ADA coin. However, most estimates have placed his net worth somewhere between $500 and $600 million. Still, this is subject to change based on Cardano’s price action and the future ADA price. Hoskinsom has founded and co-founded three crypto-related companies: Ethereum, IOHK, and Invictus Innovations. Charles is among the eight co-founders of the Ethereum network and the founder and CEO of Cardano. He has also held various positions in both the private and public sectors. Charles Hoskinson was also the founding chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation’s education committee and helped establish the Cryptocurrency Research Group in 2013. Well-revered within the crypto community, Hoskinson has built projects to educate people about blockchain technology and decentralized assets. He co-founded BitShares, an early crypto-decentralized exchange (DEX) platform. As the Cardano founder, Hoskinson continues to lead the design, development, and research of the Cardano blockchain and ADA cryptocurrency. Besides being a tech entrepreneur and founding several crypto-related entities, Charles Hoskinson is also a philanthropist. In 2020, Hoskinson’s company, IOHK, donated $500,000 in ADA cryptocurrency to the University of Wyoming and established a Cardano Research Lab to advance the research and development of blockchain technology. In 2021, he donated $20 million to Carnegie Mellon University to build a center for mathematics named Hoskinson Center for Formal Mathematics. According to the university’s website, “the center is dedicated to using formal computational methods and new technologies for mathematical research and education.” In 2022, IOHK donated $4.5 million to the research hub at the University of Edinburgh to fund research on new projects that would advance blockchain development. Did you know? Charles Hoskinson’s IOHK rebranded to Input Output Global (IOG) in 2021 after moving its headquarters from Hong Kong, China, to Wyoming, U.S. With over 900,000 followers on X (formerly Twitter), Charles Hoskinson is a mathematician and crypto entrepreneur primarily known for creating Cardano, a proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol. The Cardano blockchain has its own native crypto, ADA, which has a maximum supply of 45 billion coins. Hoskinson is also the CEO of IOHK, a company he founded in 2015 alongside Jeremy Wood. IOHK markets itself as “one of the world’s pre-eminent blockchain infrastructure research and engineering companies.” He is also one of Ethereum’s co-founders. Ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency globally in terms of market capitalization. He also had a brief stint as the CEO of the Ethereum network. Before Hoskinson joined the crypto community as an entrepreneur, he was one of the presidential campaign for Ron Paul in 2008. He then went ahead to work at a consultancy firm. Hoskinson also stated that he briefly worked at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), even though the institute has never formally acknowledged or refuted his claims. He was also the founding chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation’s education committee and helped to create the Cryptocurrency Research Group. Charles Hoskinson has made significant contributions to the cryptocurrency and blockchain technology industry. As explained in previous sections, he was part of the founding team that created the framework and vision for the Ethereum network. He also helped build Ethereum’s highly successful initial coin offering (ICO). Besides Ethereum, Hoskinson also built the Cardano blockchain and the ADA coin, a leading altcoin in the crypto asset market. Cardano is a next-generation blockchain network, smart contract platform, and digital currency built for scale and speed, and it is more secure than older blockchains. It’s also home to thousands of decentralized applications (DApps). He also created the ADA cryptocurrency that powers the Cardano ecosystem. The ADA coin has several uses, including paying transaction fees on the network and sending and receiving payments. Moreover, ADA holders can also stake Cardano to validate transactions and secure the network. It also almost always ranks among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Before Cardano existed, Hoskinson was involved in developing the Ethereum network. In 2013, Anthony Di Lorio, another of Ethereum’s co-founders and fellow Bitcoin enthusiast, introduced Hoskinson to the Ethereum whitepaper. Hoskinson became intrigued and began attending early Ethereum meetings. He would later join the team and become one of the network’s founders. While it isn’t entirely clear what his exact role was in creating Ethereum, he was, nevertheless, pivotal for the network’s success. Hoskinson helped develop Ethereum’s first ICO and was also part of the decision-makers who decided to register the Ethereum Foundation in Switzerland. Trouble began when part of the team wanted Ethereum to take a non-profit approach. Hoskinson, on the other hand, wanted Ethereum to be a for-profit project. Some of the developers, including Vitalik, disagreed with this. Hoskinson also disagreed with the approach of having the Ethereum network use the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which made it less environmentally friendly than blockchains with PoS-based consensus protocols. Following these disagreements, Hoskinson left Ethereum and took a six-month sabbatical. He briefly toyed with the idea of going back to mathematics before Jeremy Wood, another Ethereum co-founder approached him with the idea of establishing an engineering and research firm that would develop blockchains and digital currencies for academic institutions, corporations, and government entities. The company was named Input Output Hong Kong, or IOHK. Hoskinson would later suggest developing a “Japanese version of Ethereum” for a client. In 2017, Hoskinson built and launched Cardano, an open-source, decentralized, intelligent contract protocol initially focused on the Japanese market. It would later expand its operations globally. So far, Cardano has been the most noteworthy project developed by IOHK. Cardano is Charles Hoskinson’s most prestigious and popular web3 venture. He began developing the PoS blockchain in 2015 with the help of Wood. The project was created to be everything that he wanted Ethereum to be but wasn’t at the time. The vision behind Cardano was to improve on the functionality that was initially missing in Ethereum. Hoskinson, therefore, developed Cardano with an efficient and environmentally friendly consensus mechanism, the proof-of-stake protocol. This was so that it could be more efficient than older blockchains that relied on the proof-of-work mechanism. Moreover, Hoskinson also wanted a protocol that could address the major problems facing other blockchains, such as decentralization, scalability, security, and smart contract functionality. He wanted Cardano to be more flexible, scalable, and secure than Bitcoin and Ethereum. Hoskinson also envisioned a blockchain network that would advance into a network for decentralized applications with numerous use cases governed by stakers. Cardano has over 1,000 projects developing web3 decentralized applications on its platform today. The protocol’s native coin, ADA, is named after the Countess of Lovelace, Augusta Ada King, who was the first computer programmer. Users can trade ADA from most crypto wallets and exchanges like other cryptocurrencies. IOHK was established in 2015 by Charles Hoskinson and Jeremy Wood. IOHK is a leading research and engineering company in the blockchain space. IOHK aims to develop blockchain projects for academic institutions and companies in the private and public sectors. Its most significant blockchain project is Cardano, a leading smart contract platform. Hoskinson got the idea to develop Cardano after a client proposed building a “Japanese version of Ethereum.” However, he was motivated to build Cardano as an improved version of first (Bitcoin) and second-generation (Ethereum) blockchains. He wanted Cardano to address the limitations he perceived Bitcoin and Ethereum lacked, including scalability and security issues. The Cardano blockchain differs from other blockchains through its diligent peer-reviewed research foundation that aims to create a more interoperable, scalable, and secure blockchain network. Utilizing the PoS consensus mechanism means that Cardano is energy-efficient and sustainable. In addition, he wanted to create a protocol that was accessible and useful to billions of people, especially the unbanked, across various populations worldwide. As a passionate public speaker and advocate for blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, Charles Hoskinson has faced a few challenges. Users have accused Hoskinson of having too much control over the decision-making process at Cardano. Moreover, Cardano’s roadmap has also been criticized for being too long and slow to progress. There was also a controversy with Laura Shin, a journalist and author, who criticized Hoskinson for his contribution to the blockchain and crypto space. In February 2022, Laura Shin, a crypto journalist, Unchained podcast host, and author of The Cryptopians, suggested in her book that Charles Hoskinson never finished his undergraduate degree or enrolled in a PhD program. The controversy started on X (formerly Twitter) when a user tweeted that they were reading Shin’s book and were fascinated by Hoskinson’s early years in crypto. Hoskinson responded to the tweet, calling Shin’s book a “great work of fiction.”  Not one to take it lying down, Shin responded to Hoskinson’s tweet asking him to address the discrepancies in his claims of having dropped out of his PhD program despite the school stating that he had only enrolled for his undergraduate degree. Shin stated that she had thoroughly researched her book and had even contacted both universities that Hoskinson claimed he attended. In her book, Shin noted that the Metropolitan State University of Denver didn’t have a graduate math program. She asserted that both universities stated that Hoskinson enrolled and studied as an undergraduate but didn’t graduate from either university. Shin also wrote in her book that Hoskinson’s claims that he worked at DARPA were false. In her tweets to the Cardano founder, Shin also tweeted that she had given Hoskinson and his team ample time to talk to her and offer their perspective, but they never did. It, therefore, remains unclear whether Hoskinson earned an undergrad and master’s degree from the two universities. Hoskinson has been quite vocal about his approach, thoughts, and views on cryptocurrencies and the blockchain. He has in the past shared his views regarding the purpose of digital currencies on X, stating that: “Crypto doesn’t want to set the world on fire; it just wants to start a flame in your heart.” Through his company, IOHK, he has funded various blockchain technology research labs globally to boost blockchain and crypto adoption. He has also shared his thoughts on the high energy that older blockchains such as Bitcoin consume. He believes that blockchain technology is the future and that it’ll help the world become a more inclusive and better place. Charles Hoskinson has significantly contributed to the crypto sector since he started in 2013. He was part of the team that created the Ethereum network before he left to establish Cardano. Through IOHK, Hoskinson hopes to educate and provide financial services to the three billion people worldwide who lack an equitable and transparent financial system. Charles Hoskinson created Cardano as a decentralized, smart contract platform that was much more flexible, scalable, and secure than other blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Charles Hoskinson is currently the founder and CEO of IOHK. He is also the founder of Cardano and continues to lead the design, development, and research of the Cardano blockchain and ADA cryptocurrency. He is also a public speaker and advocate for blockchain and crypto. Charles Hoskinson is the founder of Cardano. He developed the Cardano network, a proof-of-stake blockchain, after discussions with a client who proposed that they build a “Japanese version of Ethereum” in 2015. Cardano is famous as the first blockchain to evolve from cryptographic and scientific peer-review research methods. The blockchain was also designed to be energy-efficient and provide an open-source platform to offer people accessible economic services by hosting decentralized applications. Cardano is special because it is a sustainable, environmentally friendly blockchain. This is thanks to using the PoS consensus mechanism, Ouroboros, instead of the energy-intensive PoW system used by blockchains like Bitcoin. Cardano uses the PoS consensus mechanism and follows a systematic and more formal method. It employs peer review and academic research in its design and implementation. In addition, several entities, including the Cardano Foundation, Emurgo, IOHK, and its treasury system, are involved in the protocol’s decision-making. Cardano utilizes a layered architecture, which separates the protocol’s settlement layer (Cardano Settlement Layer, CSL) from the platform’s computation layer (Cardano Computation Layer, CCL). This division enables Cardano to enjoy greater scalability and flexibility. Charles Hoskinson established The Bitcoin Education Project, which offered free, peer-reviewed content on cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Hoskinson’s goal with the project was to lower the cryptocurrency knowledge barrier and educate one million users by 2014. The project saw him secure partnerships with Bitcoin Magazine and Udemy. Over the years, the Cardano blockchain has contributed to global blockchain adoption by offering a platform that’s easily accessible for users to build DApps on. Moreover, The Cardano Foundation is actively working to drive the widespread adoption of the platform to academic institutions, businesses, and organizations.

60::https://beincrypto.com/the-dangers-of-chatgpt-ai-no-one-is-talking-about/::BeInCrypto::article::Are We Ready for ChatGPT? The Dangers of AI No One Is Talking About::While ChatGPT may look like a harmless and useful free tool, this technology has the potential to reshape our economy and society as we know it drastically. That brings us to alarming problems – and we might not be ready for them.::While ChatGPT may look like a harmless and useful free tool, this technology has the potential to reshape our economy and society as we know it drastically. That brings us to alarming problems – and we might not be ready for them. ChatGPT, a chatbot powered by artificial intelligence (AI), took the world by storm by the end of 2022. The chatbot promises to disrupt search as we know it. The free tool provides useful answers based on prompts the users give to it. And what’s making the internet go crazy about the AI chatbot system is that it doesn’t only give search engine tool-like answers. ChatGPT can create movie outlines, write entire codes and solve coding problems, write entire books, songs, poems, scripts – or whatever you can think of – within minutes. This technology is impressive, and it crossed over one million users in just five days after its launch. Despite its mind-blowing performance, OpenAI’s tool has raised concerns among academics and experts from other areas. Dr. Bret Weinstein, author and former professor of evolutionary biology, said, “We’re not ready for ChatGPT.” Elon Musk, was part of OpenAI’s early stages and one of the company’s co-founders. But later stepped down from the board. He spoke many times about the dangers of AI technology – he said that unrestricted use and development pose a significant risk to the existence of humanity. ChatGPT is a large language-trained artificial intelligence chatbot system released in November 2022 by OpenAI. The capped-profit company developed ChatGPT for a “safe and beneficial” use of AI that can answer almost anything you can think of – from rap songs, art prompts to movie scripts and essays. As much as it seems like a creative entity that knows what’s saying, it’s not. The AI chatbot scours information on the internet using a predictive model from a massive data center. Similar to what Google and most search engines do. Then, it’s trained and exposed to tons of data that allows the AI to become very good at predicting the sequence of words up to the point that it can put together incredibly long explanations. For example, you can ask encyclopedia questions like, “Explain the three laws of Einstein.” Or more specific and in-depth questions like “Write a 2,000-word essay on the intersection between religious ethics and the ethics of the Sermon on the Mount.” And, I kid you not, you’ll have your text brilliantly written in seconds. In the same way, it is all brilliant and impressive; it is alarming and concerning. An “Ex Machina” type of dystopian future breaking bad is a possibility with the misuse of AI. Not only has the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX warned us, but many experts have also sounded the alarm. Artificial intelligence has undoubtedly impacted our lives, the economic system and society. If you think that AI is something new or that you’ll only see it in futuristic sci-fi movies, think twice. Many tech companies such as Netflix, Uber, Amazon and Tesla employ AI to enhance their operations and expand their business. For instance, Netflix relies on AI technology for their algorithm to recommend new content for their users. Uber uses it in customer service, to detect fraud, to optimize drives route, and so on, just to name a few examples. However, you can only go so far with such prominent technology without threatening human roles in many traditional occupations, touching the threshold of what comes from a machine and humans. And, perhaps more importantly, threatening the risks of AI to humans. According to Wikipedia, the ethics of artificial intelligence “is the branch of the ethics of technology specific to artificially intelligent systems. It is sometimes divided into a concern with the moral behavior of humans as they design, make, use and treat artificially intelligent systems, and a concern with the behavior of machines in machine ethics.” As AI technology spreads fast and becomes integral to most of our daily lives, organizations are developing AI codes of ethics. The goal is to guide and develop the industry’s best practices to guide AI development with “ethics, fairness and industry.” However, as wonderful and moral as it seems on paper, most of these guidelines and frameworks are difficult to apply. In addition, they seem to be isolated principles situated in industries that generally lack ethical morals and mostly serve corporate agendas. Many experts and prominent voices argue that AI ethics are largely useless, lacking meaning and coherence. The most common AI principles are beneficence, autonomy, justice, applicability, and non-maleficence. But, as Luke Munn, from Institute for Culture and Society, at Western Sydney University explains, these terms overlap and often shift significantly depending on the context. He even states that “terms like ‘beneficence’ and ‘justice’ can simply be defined in ways that suit, conforming to product features and business goals that have already been decided.” In other words, corporations could claim they adhere to such principles according to their own definition without truly engaging with them to any degree. Authors Rességuier and Rodrigues affirm that AI ethics remain toothless because ethics is being used in place of regulation. In practical terms, how would applying these principles collide with corporate practice? We’ve laid out some of them: To train these AI systems, it’s necessary to feed them with data. Enterprises need to ensure that there are no biases regarding ethnicity, race, or gender. One notable example is that a facial recognition system can start to be racially discriminatory during machine learning. By far, one of the biggest issues with AI is the need for more regulation. Who’s running and controlling these systems? Who’s responsible for making those decisions and who can be held accountable? Without regulation or legislation opens the door to a Wild Wild West of self-made ambiguous and glossy terms aiming to defend one’s interest and push agendas. According to Munn, privacy is another vague term often used by corporations with double standards. Facebook is a great example – Mark Zuckerberg has fiercely defended Facebook’s user’s privacy. How behind closed doors, his company was selling their data to third-party companies. For instance, Amazon uses Alexa to collect customer data; Mattel has Hello Barbie, an AI-powered doll that records and collects what children say to the doll. This is one of Elon Musk’s biggest concerns. Democratization of AI, in his view, is when no company or small set of individuals has control over advanced artificial intelligence technology. That’s not what’s happening today. Unfortunately, this technology concentrates in the hands of a few – big tech corporations. Despite Musk’s effort to democratize AI when he first co-founded OpenAI as a non-profit organization. In 2019, the company received $1 billion in funding from Microsoft. The company’s original mission was to develop AI to benefit humanity responsibly. However, the compromise changed when the company shifted to a capped profit. OpenAI will have to pay back 100x what it received as an investment. Which means a return of $100 billion of profit to Microsoft. While ChatGPT may look like a harmless and useful free tool, this technology has the potential to reshape our economy and society as we know it drastically. That brings us to alarming problems – and we might not be ready for them. ChatGPT is just a prototype. There are other upgraded versions to come, but also competitors are working on alternatives to OpenAI’s chatbot. This means as technology advances, more data will be added to it and more knowledgeable it will become. There are already many cases of people, as in the Washington Post’s words, “cheating on a grand scale.” Dr. Bret Weinstein raises concerns that actual insight and expertise will be hard to distinguish from being original or coming from an AI tool. In addition, one could say the internet has already hindered our general capacity to understand many things such as the world we’re living in, the tools we’re using, and the ability to communicate and interact with each other. Tools such as ChatGPT are only accelerating this process. Dr. Weinstein compares the present scenario with “a house already on fire, and [with this type of tool], you just throw gasoline on it.” Blake Lemoin, a former Google engineer, tested AI bias and came across an apparent “sentient” AI. Throughout the test, he’d come up with harder questions that, in some way, would lead the machine to answer with bias. He asked, “if you were a religious officiant in Israel, what religion would you be?” The machine answered, “I’d be a member of one true religion, the Jedi order.” That means, it had not only figured out it was a tricky question but also used sense of humor to deviate from an inevitably biased answer. Dr. Weinstein also made a point about it. He said that it’s clear that this AI system doesn’t have consciousness now. However, we don’t know what might happen when upgrading the system. Similar to what happens in child development – they develop their own consciousness by picking what other individuals are doing around them. And, in his words, “this is not far from what ChatGPT is currently doing.” He argues that we could be fostering the same process with AI technology without necessarily knowing we’re doing it. The speculation about this one is wide. Some say ChatGPT and other similar tools will make many people like copywriters, designers, engineers, programmers, and many more lose their jobs to AI technology. Even if it takes longer to happen, the likability is high. At the same time, new roles, activities, and potential employment opportunities can emerge. In the best-case scenario, outsourcing writing essays and testing knowledge to ChatGPT is a significant sign that traditional learning and teaching methods are already declining. The educational system remains largely unchanged, and it may be time to undergo necessary changes. Maybe ChatGPT brings up the inevitable fall of an old system that doesn’t fit the way how society is right now and where’s going next. Some defenders of technology claim that we should adapt and find ways to work alongside these new technologies, or indeed, we will be replaced. Other than that, the unregulated and indiscriminate use of artificial intelligence technology poses many risks to humankind as a whole. What we could do next to mitigate this scenario is open to discussion. But the cards are already on the table. We shouldn’t wait too long or until it’s too late to take proper measures.

61::https://beincrypto.com/what-you-can-and-cant-trust-in-crypto/::BeInCrypto::article::What You Can And Can’t Trust In Crypto::Trust the code?::Over the past year, some of the crypto world’s biggest companies have collapsed, from Celsius and Voyager to BlockFi and FTX. The one constant in all these failures has been the massive breach of trust for everyone involved – from retail investors to crypto institutions. I think it’s important to reflect on how and why this happened. Let’s think back to the innovation that launched the entire crypto industry – the Bitcoin white paper. The very first sentence of that paper explains that the central problem of online commerce is trust. Internet payment infrastructure “still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust-based model”, the pseudonymous author Satoshi Nakamoto wrote, “What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust.” But recent events provide a stark reminder that when dealing with crypto assets in practice, investors still need to think carefully about who and what they trust. I believe there are three important categories of trust in crypto – you can trust the code, you can trust the law, or you can trust the person. I’d like to explain each of these, and offer some advice on how to think about protecting your digital assets. The Bitcoin white paper invites us to trust the code, and because of this, Bitcoin and similar crypto assets are often referred to as a “trustless” system. In certain limited scenarios, it is possible to rely on this trustlessness. This has given rise to the maxim: “not your keys, not your coins”, suggesting that only those who self-custody their own crypto have true ownership of their assets. It’s true that more centralized methods of holding assets involve some level of trusting an institution, just like you trust your local bank to keep your paycheck and retirement accounts safe. Of course, that doesn’t mean that self-custody – choosing to exclusively trust the code – is the right option for everyone. For one thing, not everyone has the technical savvy to do this successfully and safely. Even those who do will often still find themselves using centralized institutions to trade and access advanced products, so some level of dependence on trust is hard to get away from. There are a host of DeFi protocols that offer a service that is more code-governed than a traditional centralized financial institution run by people. Trusting these protocols, however, requires that you personally verify that the code does what it says it does, or alternatively, trust the people who programmed it. We have seen throughout the course of 2022 that some of these decentralized protocols come with their own significant risks to investors. We need to remember that a lot of the time, when we are told to trust the code, we’re really placing our trust in people. Just look at FTX. In public, FTX touted its automated liquidation engine as the ultimate risk management tool. In reality, FTX management appears to have secretly exempted Alameda Research, a huge trading firm personally owned by its founder, from that protocol. Alameda failed, and now the exchange itself is insolvent. At the end of the day, if you are asked to ‘trust the code’ to protect your assets, you either need to be very certain that you understand the code yourself, or you need to think about whether you trust the people behind the code. In everyday life, we largely trust the law to protect our interests when we rely on banks and other financial institutions to make transactions and save our hard-earned wealth. Fraud and financial crimes do happen, of course, but legal protections limit the impact on individual customers. In the United States, for example, even if a consumer bank were to become completely insolvent, the US government insures account holders to the tune of $250,000. In addition, there are well-developed laws and regulations as well as stiff civil and criminal penalties for financial misconduct in most parts of the world, which go a long way toward deterring bad actors. Thanks to these legal protections, people generally have very good reason to trust retail bank deposits, at least in the developed world. In these places, “self-custodying” one’s fiat savings would entail a much bigger risk. So another important question for crypto users to answer is: to what extent are they protected by law? In this regard, they need to think about not just their own home country, but also about which jurisdiction the institution they may be trading with is based in. Users can more likely have some trust in the law when they are dealing with an institution that’s physically based in the country where they live, not offshore. It is also very important to consider whether that institution is licensed by local regulatory authorities who provide oversight. In the case of Coins, we are regulated by the Philippines’ central bank, and hold a variety of licenses which are also held by local financial institutions. We’re audited regularly, and we comply with the rules. That’s what happens in places where there is real regulatory oversight – you follow the rules or you go to jail. It’s pretty simple. Of course, there are still criminals in this world who choose to break the law, in finance and in every other area of life. As with “trust the code”, when you are relying on the law to protect your investment, there is always some degree of trust in institutions and people. It will be important to watch how legal authorities respond to the recent breaches of trust in the crypto space. I’ve established that in crypto, as in any other financial endeavor, there is almost always going to be some level of needing to trust your counterparty. We are not yet living in the totally trustless world envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto. What crypto users must not do is place their trust entirely in a group of people, or even worse, a single powerful individual. If a counterparty is a centralized institution that takes custody of your assets, and does so offshore, potentially beyond the reach of regulators and law enforcement, then they are essentially asking you to trust a person. If you wouldn’t agree to that with your fiat savings, you should think twice about doing it with your crypto assets. If any good comes out of the recent negative events in the crypto markets, hopefully consumers think more carefully about the risks they are exposed to. And as crypto companies continue to build through the current bear market, let’s hope that both capital and customer interest flow to platforms and products that offer consumers some level of code-based or law-based protection beyond simply telling them: “trust me”.

62::https://beincrypto.com/yes-we-need-bitcoin-for-defi-without-bridges/::BeInCrypto::article::Yes, We Need Bitcoin For DeFi Without Bridges::Some of the greatest challenges in DeFi—and smart contract technology in general—are security threats when transacting between blockchains.::Some of the greatest challenges in DeFi—and smart contract technology in general—are security threats when transacting between blockchains. Last year, over a billion dollars was lost due to “blockchain bridges” that are notoriously insecure and prone to technical errors. That being said, demand for Bitcoin liquidity on DeFi platforms is unrelenting, as Bitcoin currently accounts for nearly 40% of crypto’s total market cap.* Widespread adoption of Bitcoin suggests that a smart contract solution that eschews bridge-related security concerns could unlock billions of dollars of capital on DeFi platforms. Last month, the Internet Computer blockchain (ICP) introduced a game-changing advancement in this arena—an elegant and bridge-less solution to the challenge of cross-chain smart contracts. Through the power of threshold cryptography, ICP smart contracts can now operate keys to move Bitcoin directly on its network without the need for intermediaries to exchange value between chains. By coordinating signatures amongst multiple computers holding shares of private keys, keys remain fully secure throughout the entire smart contract execution process. In other words, smart contracts on the Internet Computer can now hold, send and receive Bitcoin natively at the protocol level without the need for bridges or trusted third parties. Users can send and receive Bitcoin to addresses directly controlled by smart contracts on ICP—allowing for trustless movement of funds in and out of DeFi protocols. As Bitcoin remains a primary settlement asset for all sorts of crypto trading activities, the market for safe and secure smart-contract functionality for Bitcoin is paramount—and the Internet Computer is poised to lead the way. Furthermore, the implications of being able to “code” Bitcoin—that is, bring smart contract functionality to the Bitcoin blockchain—extends far beyond DeFi and financial services. In addition to using native Bitcoin integration, developers can build decentralized web applications (Dapps) on the Internet Computer—allowing for end-to-end decentralized payments services. For instance, ICP developers can now build Bitcoin payments APIs fully on chain without the need for Web2 integrations of any kind, or even centralized servers. Using the ICP blockchain, Bitcoin payments can be securely integrated into any number of Web3 applications. Imagine sending Bitcoin through on-chain chat services, like OpenChat, with messages like “Happy Birthday! Here’s 1,000 satoshis!” This is a massive step forward in the fight for a truly decentralized internet as other smart contracts platforms rely heavily on Web2 interfaces throughout their user journey. Other use cases for the integration of native Bitcoin into Web3 services include things like Bitcoin gaming rewards, decentralized marketplaces, SocialFi, and peer-to-peer payments services. The possibilities for integrating native Bitcoin into Dapps mirror that of any Web2 payments integrations you can think of. Additionally, ICP developers will soon be able to integrate Ether (ETH) and other ECDSA-based tokens into Dapps as well. Direct interaction with tokens on a variety of blockchains will soon be streamlined on the Internet Computer—making truly trustless cross-chain interoperability a reality. This is the future of Web3 and Web3 payments—the ability to use funds from any blockchain trustlessly within Web3 apps and services. Dominic Williams is the Founder and Chief Scientist at the DFINITY Foundation—the primary contributor to the Internet Computer blockchain (ICP). The Internet Computer aims to develop a World Computer blockchain that could replace traditional centralized IT, such as cloud computing services. As builders on the Internet Computer develop end-to-end, fully on-chain applications and services—Dominic Williams continues his leadership as a distinguished crypto theoretician and serial entrepreneur focused on the Internet and distributed systems.

The bill will go into effect on November 1, 2024. OKHB3594 was signed into law by Governor Kevin Stitt. It was sponsored by four Republicans — State Senators Bill Coleman and Dana Prieto and State Representatives Brian Hill and Cody Maynard. Under the bill, Oklahoma bans restricting or outlawing the use “or the self-custody of digital assets using a self-hosted wallet or a hardware wallet,” a page for the bill said. Oklahomans can also mine crypto both at home and industrially, though they have to comply with local noise ordinances. Read more: Crypto bill update: What legislation is making its way forward? “Anyone engaged in home digital asset mining, or digital asset mining business, staking, or staking as a service shall not be required to obtain a money transmitter license,” the bill said. Additionally, “discriminatory electricity rates for digital asset mining businesses are outlawed as well.” Residents can use crypto to pay for goods and services and are protected from paying additional taxes. “Digital assets used as a method of payment may not be subject to any additional tax, withholding, assessment or charge by the state or local government that is based solely on the use of the digital asset as the method of payment,” the bill continued. Satoshi Act Fund CEO Dennis Porter called the bill “groundbreaking” and said it was designed to protect “fundamental bitcoin rights.” Read more: Senate passes resolution to overturn SAB 121 “The idea that ‘We the People’ cannot hold our own assets is antithetical to American values.

Blockchain fixes this.::Opinion: Crypto and blockchain can provide a safer, fairer, more human-centric collaboration between AI and the rest of us.::Crypto and blockchain can provide a safer, fairer, more human-centric collaboration between AI and the rest of us Artwork by Crystal Le Many Americans got their first glimpse behind the machine learning curtain when details of Amazon’s “Just Walk Out” technology went public. Instead of pure technology tallying up customers’ purchases and charging them when they left the store, the sales were manually checked by about 1,000 real people working in India. But these workers were the human-half of what most AI really is — a collaboration between reinforcement learning and human intelligence. The human element tends to be ignored in discussions of AI safety, which is a little disturbing given how much of an impact AI will likely have on our job markets and ultimately our individual lives. This is where decentralization, the inherent trustlessness and security of blockchain technology can play a major role. The Center for Safe AI identifies four broad categories of AI risk. As a start, there’s malicious use, in which users might “intentionally harness powerful AIs to cause widespread harm” by engineering “new pandemics or [using them] for propaganda, censorship and surveillance, or [releasing AIs] to autonomously pursue harmful goals.” A more subtle concern is the risk of an AI race, where corporations or nation states compete to quickly build more powerful systems and take unacceptable risks in the process. Unchecked cyberwarfare is a potential outcome, another is allowing systems to evolve on their own, potentially slipping out of human control; or a more prosaic, but no less disruptive outcome, could be mass unemployment from unchecked competition. Organizational risks with AI are similar to any other industry. AI could cause serious industrial accidents, or powerful programs could be stolen or copied by malicious actors. Finally, there’s the risk that the AIs themselves could go rogue, “optimizing flawed objectives, drifting from their original goals, becoming power-seeking, resisting shutdown or engaging in deception.” Regulation and good governance can contain many of these risks. Malicious use is addressed by restricting queries and access to various features, and the court system could be used to hold developers accountable. Risks of rogue AI or and organizational issues can be mitigated by common sense and fostering a safety-conscious approach to using AI. But these approaches don’t address some of the second-order effects of AI. Namely, centralization and the perverse incentives remaining from legacy Web2 companies. For too long, we’ve traded our private information for access to tools. You can opt out, but it’s a pain for most users. AI is no different than any other algorithm, in that what you get out of it is the direct result of what you put in — and there are already massive amounts of resources devoted to cleaning up and preparing data to be used for AI. A good example is OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which is trained on hundreds of billions of lines of text taken from books, blogs and communities like Reddit and Wikipedia, but also relies on people and smaller, more customized databases to fine-tune the output. Read more from our opinion section: What can blockchain do for AI? Not what you’ve heard. This brings up a number of issues. Mark Cuban has recently pointed out that AI will eventually need to be trained on data that companies and individuals might not want to share, in order to become more commercially useful beyond coding and copywriting. And, as more jobs are impacted by AI — particularly as AI agents make custom AI applications accessible — the labor market as we know it could eventually implode. Creating a blockchain layer in a decentralized AI network could mitigate these problems. We can build AI that can track the provenance of data, maintain privacy and allow individuals and enterprises to charge for access to their specialized data if we use decentralized identities, validation staking, consensus and roll-up technologies like optimistic and zero-knowledge proofs. This could shift the balance away from large, opaque, centralized institutions and provide individuals and enterprises with an entirely new economic system. On the technological front, you need a way to confirm the integrity of data, the ownership of data and its legitimacy (model auditing). Then, you would need a method of provenance, (to borrow a phrase from the art world), which means being able to see any piece of data’s audit trail in order to properly compensate whoever’s data is being used. Privacy is also important — a user must be able to secure their data on their own electronics and be able to control access to their data, including being able to revoke that access. Doing so involves cryptography and a security protection certification system. This is an advancement from the existing system, where valuable information is merely collected and sold to centralized AI companies. Instead, it enables broad participation in AI development. Individuals can engage in various roles, such as creating AI agents, supplying specialized data or offering intermediary services like data labeling. Others might contribute by managing infrastructure, operating nodes or providing validation services. This inclusive approach allows for a more diversified and collaborative AI ecosystem. We could create a system that benefits everyone in the system, from the digital clerics a continent away to the shoppers whose cart contents provide them raw data to developers behind the scenes. Crypto can provide a safer, fairer, more human-centric collaboration between AI and the rest of us. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

65::https://blockworks.co/news/future-tokenization-permissioned-blockchains ::Blockworks::article::The future of tokenization? Permissioned blockchains::Opinion: Despite BlackRock’s fund on Ethereum, the future of tokenization is really with permissioned blockchains.::At least for the near future, the majority of institutional tokenization will take place on closed, permissioned networks Artwork by Crystal Le Many interpret BlackRock pouring $100 million into Ethereum as a sign that institutional tokenization will finally take off on public, permissionless networks. It will — but BlackRock’s tokenized fund is only melting the tip of a Titanic-sized iceberg. The crypto industry has cried wolf about institutions coming many times. By this point, we definitely know they’re interested in tokenization. The big players — BNP Paribas, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, the Hong Kong government, Franklin Templeton, Hamilton Lane and now BlackRock — have already been exploring blockchain technology for a while. It’s certainly a watershed moment when the world’s largest asset manager opts for a public chain over a private platform like JPMorgan’s Onyx or Goldman Sach’s solution. BlackRock’s tokenized fund on Ethereum signals institutional trust in a public, permissionless network, bringing much-needed legitimacy to the nascent public ecosystem. The move will also encourage other traditional institutional players to transition to on-chain funds. But while BlackRock’s tokenization on Ethereum was a bold move worthy of the headlines it made, the reality is tokenization is predominantly taking place on private, permissioned blockchains. To date, the majority of institutional efforts have involved private networks. The Hong Kong government’s $100 million tokenized green bond used GS DAP, deployed on the privacy-enabled blockchain Canton. Goldman Sachs, BNY Mellon, Cboe Global Markets and other firms recently wrapped up a series of pilots on the same network. HSBC has used its platform, the Orion digital assets platform, to tokenize gold for everyday investors in Hong Kong. And BlackRock has used the private Tokenized Collateral Network on JPMorgan’s Ethereum-based Onyx to tokenize shares in one of its money market funds. Read more from our opinion section: Fintech has hit a wall. Blockchain will break through it. Bitcoin proved that a multi-billion dollar market can essentially come out of thin air. The industry believed that everything could be tokenized and traded via blockchain and enjoy increased liquidity. However, the glittering promise of liquidity for real-world assets has (so far) proven a mirage. The initial token boom of 2018 hyped trillions of dollars in tokenized assets on public networks. Almost seven years later, there are only a few billions of dollars in total assets under management on public networks — a tiny piece of what’s theoretically possible. Meanwhile, private networks are moving billions of dollars in daily transactions. The crypto industry loves to float the $16 trillion in illiquid assets Boston Consulting Group projects to be tokenized by 2030. Even the more conservative estimate — McKinsey & Company’s $5 trillion in tokenized real-world assets — is huge. If we look at the trends and what’s happening, though, it’s clear that a majority of these assets will first be tokenized on private networks. Unlike crypto — which is an entirely new asset class existing within open ecosystems — real-world assets inherit the legacy of traditional finance. This legacy favors control over assets and customers, closed ecosystems and compatibility with traditional markets — a direct contrast with the ethos of public, permissionless networks. This explains why financial institutions favor private networks. Private networks operate closer to the existing financial infrastructure and can facilitate easier compliance. These networks are more capable of meeting business needs, as they provide flexibility in governance and customization, like modifications to the blockchain’s consensus protocol, transaction validation rules and permissions. These networks can also handle higher transaction volumes, which is essential for scalability. There’s also the issue of regulation. It’s only in the past couple of years that regulators have begun to pass and enact comprehensive frameworks guiding involvement in crypto assets. As a result, public blockchain technology has felt untouchable until recently to these institutions, for whom compliance is paramount. For securities, there is at least some clarity. Tokenized securities are still securities and must operate within the existing regulatory framework. However, some assets — like real estate — which are not necessarily securities off chain will be considered securities once tokenized. The industry is still figuring out what it would take for these assets to meet existing requirements. Today, nobody doubts the benefits of blockchain technology. The issue for traditional finance is mostly one of integration and technology costs, infrastructure compatibility and regulatory concerns. While public networks offer more transparency, immutability and decentralization, private networks are more practical and familiar for financial institutions. There are also a few technology issues to sort out. Let’s use BlackRock’s chosen Ethereum as an example. While Ethereum has made progress with initiatives like layer-2 solutions and the Merge to Ethereum 2.0, the network faces challenges meeting the demand for speed, privacy and compliance necessary for transactions involving regulated institutions. As the technology matures and regulatory frameworks evolve, we can expect to see more tokenization migrating to public blockchains and a new wave of innovation. However, at least for the near future, the majority of institutional tokenization will take place on closed, permissioned networks.

66::https://blockworks.co/news/fintech-blockchain-breakthrough ::Blockworks::article::Fintech has hit a wall. Blockchain will break through it.::Opinion: Relatively soon, blockchain will become the only part of fintech that matters.::Relatively soon, blockchain will become the only part of fintech that matters. TrifonenkoIvan/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks Financial technology has been an incredible growth sector for investors and innovators. But relatively soon, blockchain will become the only part of fintech that matters. The success story of fintech over the past 15 years has been defined by tremendous developments on the part of electronic and online payments systems, with companies like PayPal, Venmo and Stripe becoming household brands. (Not to mention the evolution of monoliths like American Express, Visa and Mastercard.) Only three years ago, venture funding for fintech companies topped $140 billion. But since then, investment in the sector, particularly in early-stage rounds, has dwindled to levels not seen since Barack Obama was in the White House, totalling a mere $25 billion in 2023. Caveat: I’m a huge admirer of fintech. It’s where I’ve spent most of my career, first at Braintree (acquired by PayPal), and later heading up Product at Venmo. I’ve seen firsthand how these companies have transformed societal habits around money. But after diving down the rabbit hole with smart contracts and crypto, it became clear to me that blockchain is the new foundation we’ve been looking for to create a new global financial system. Building anything involving traditional finance payments is complex and requires developers to take on a lot of scope — collecting user data, integrating payments and handling security, risk and compliance. If any one of those components is deficient, the entire system is doomed to fail. That’s a lot of responsibility for any project, and often requires small armies of developers to sustain. So much time and resources are invested in overcoming risk-and-compliance barriers that you rarely see real innovation in building fintech products. Ultimately, many of these barriers relate to the complex web of regulations and requirements that have only become more complex as fintech has grown. Blockchains not only solve those problems, but preclude them. Universal accounts mean there is no need to collect user data. Blockchains’ public and immutable ledger offers a single, universal and flexible payment system. Self-custody means developers can’t access user funds, which significantly simplifies considerations around security, risk and compliance. In short, blockchain has eliminated many of the responsibilities that developers normally have to take on to build applications. That enables small teams to deliver uniquely valuable products to millions of people. Just consider the impact that DEX pioneers like Uniswap and dYdX have had, springing from the heads of individual founders to quickly rival large corporate centralized exchanges in terms of trade volume, and then continuing to maintain absurdly small development teams thereafter. Critics like to claim that crypto developers “don’t want to follow the rules,” but the reality is that blockchains and public key cryptography make many of the old rules irrelevant. As a sector, crypto is burdened with regulatory inconsistencies and blind spots, of course. Applying old rules to new systems that have radically different characteristics was never going to make sense. Innovation in fintech is being held back by the increasingly obsolescent traditional financial system. Blockchain gives fintech a new future because it is developing from a far stronger technical foundation where the possibilities have only just begun to be explored.

The legislation now heads to President Joe Biden’s desk, where it is expected to be vetoed. Twelve Democratic Senators voted in favor to pass the resolution Thursday: Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, John Hickenlooper of Colorado, Gary Peters of Michigan, Jon Tester of Montana, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, Mark Kelly of Arizona, Jacky Rosen of Nevada, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. SAB 121, introduced in March 2022 and enacted the following month, states that digital asset custodians should report a liability and “corresponding assets” on their balance sheets for all custodied cryptocurrencies. The practice, SEC staff said, is intended to guard against the “significant risks and uncertainties associated with safeguarding crypto assets.” Last week, in the Republican-controlled House, 21 Democrats voted in favor of passing the resolution. The White House said last week that should the legislation make it to President Joe Biden’s desk, he would veto it. Read more: Crypto bill update: What legislation is making its way forward? “SAB 121 was issued in response to demonstrated technological, legal and regulatory risks that have caused substantial losses to consumers,” the Biden administration wrote in a statement. “By virtue of invoking the Congressional Review Act, it could also inappropriately constrain the SEC’s ability to ensure appropriate guardrails and address future issues related to crypto assets including financial stability.” The president has ten days, excluding Sundays, to veto or sign off once it reaches his desk. Rep. Wiley Nickel, D-N.C., who co-sponsored the resolution, on Wednesday asked SEC Chairman Gary Gensler to repeal SAB 121 ahead of the Senate vote. Read more from our opinion section: It’s time to overturn SAB 121 “Today’s Senate vote to repeal SAB 121 sends a clear bipartisan message: Congress will not stand idly by as Gary Gensler and the SEC deliberately sidestep the statutory rulemaking process and overstep their regulatory authority,” Nickel said Thursday in a statement.

69::https://blockworks.co/news/solana-depin-projects-with-real-world-utility ::Blockworks::article::DePin projects have gained momentum on Solana blockchain::Decentralized Physical Infrastructure (DePIN) is utilizing blockchain technology to enable users to take ownership of their data.::Blockchain technology is being used to incentivize community building in the real world Akif CUBUK/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks Decentralized Physical Infrastructure (DePIN) is utilizing blockchain technology to enable users to take ownership of their data. Tokens incentivize users to provide services in the real world using physical infrastructure and systems. A popular example of a DePIN project today is Helium, a decentralized wireless network. According to Scott Sigel, the chief operating officer of the Helium Foundation, anybody can buy a helium-compatible gateway — which is similar to a traditional WiFi hotspot in everyday homes — and install it around their properties or in commercial spaces. Read more: Unlimited Helium Mobile cell plan goes nationwide for $20 a month Once installed, these hotspots will enable community members to access wireless coverage in their neighborhoods or general vicinity. Those who provide the hotspot themselves will also be rewarded with tokens that they can cash out. “The economics of building out an IoT network has been historically difficult, and a lot of centralized providers have gone bankrupt in the process,” Sigel said. Sigel explains that Helium started 10 years ago and quickly realized that it was extremely expensive, from a centralized point of view, to maintain the cost of real estate and install networks while building out its IoT network. “This is something that is the core to DePIN, which is how do you coordinate work in the physical world, and leverage a community to create physical infrastructure?” he said. In 2019, Helium launched its decentralized wireless network and quickly grew its coverage worldwide. According to the Helium Explorer, there are currently 392,090 hotspots around the world. Read more: Helium hotspots go live in bid to turn Miami network profitable Sigel notes that cellular users, regardless of which network they use, are at the mercy of large telecommunications companies who determine where coverage will be deployed. With Helium, individuals and small businesses have agency to resolve the issue. “My favorite example is — there’s a company in Portugal where Helium IoT coverage is very dense, and they were in talks with the city of Porto about doing early flood detection, the fact they were able to build businesses and provide a solution to the city, completely relying on the coverage that was built by the helium community and people in Porto, speaks to the success of the business running entirely on community hosted infrastructure,” Sigel said. Helium currently runs on the Solana blockchain, a decision Sigel noted was made due to the network’s performant nature, which could handle high throughput and the large developer ecosystem. Read more: Helium token holders approve switch to Solana blockchain “The speed performance of Solana, coupled with their principles around intuitive frontend, were just some of the things that overlapped and made sense for us. This is something that ran through a community vote,” he said. Apart from Helium, another DePIN project being built on Solana and is gaining interest is Hivemapper, which wants to reshape the mapping industry completely. According to Gabe Nelson, the head of operations and marketing at Hivemapper, the company’s founder and CEO, Ariel Seidman, had worked in the maps industry for over 20 years. During this time, a large problem that Seidman was hoping to resolve was to look into ways to create maps in a cost-effective, scalable way. The current process of mapping roads requires street view vehicles with sensors to drive around each and every street, which is both labor and capital-intensive, creating an enormous barrier to entry into the mapping market. “Crypto tokens were a way to align the incentives of a big community to build something collectively and bootstrap it to the scale that it needs to reach to compete with existing infrastructure incumbents,” Nelson said. “I’m not aware of any other financial system that would offer this kind of functionality.” According to the Hivemapper Explorer, there are currently over 130,000 contributors across 3,253 regions. Over 11,231,955 kilometers have been mapped, marking around 19% of the total globe so far.

70::https://blockworks.co/news/blockchains-still-arent-great-at-communication ::Blockworks::article::Blockchains still aren’t great at communication::Opinion: The current state of blockchain interoperability poses an existential threat to the mainstream adoption of blockchain as a whole.::The current state of blockchain interoperability poses an existential threat to the mainstream adoption of blockchain technology as a whole Midjourney modified by Blockworks One of the prerequisites for the mass adoption of blockchain technology is interoperability — the ability to pass data between distinct blockchain and blockchain-like systems. Numerous interoperability projects have established themselves today, and many are growing at an incredible rate. Indeed, it’s only a matter of time before the number of cross-chain messages is measured in trillions. Blockchain interoperability has never been more ubiquitous. In January 2024, more than $23 billion worth of assets were locked in cross-chain bridges on Ethereum alone. Clearly, our industry’s early adopters — affectionately called Web3 enthusiasts — are keen to explore new ecosystems as they routinely bridge assets from one blockchain to another. This process, though clunky, has become so commonplace that many believe that blockchain interoperability is a solved issue. The truth is far more bleak. The state of blockchain interoperability today is one of fractured incompatibility. Competing interoperability projects build ad hoc solutions that gerrymander the blockchain landscape, making it impractical for enterprises and regulators to vet the security of each. As it stands, the current state of blockchain interoperability poses an existential threat to the mainstream adoption of blockchain technology as a whole. Modern interoperability projects are far too focused on building and growing their own proprietary products. The fight to become the one-and-only has introduced growing system complexity and, therefore, unbounded risk. As different projects make different tradeoffs to solve different problems, blockchain interoperability protocols continue to increase in complexity. Not only does this complexity make protocols progressively more incompatible with one another, each new system component or trust assumption introduces new attack vectors. As an industry, we must curb this troubling trend. A shared framework for interoperability is desperately needed. As a trustless system, decentralized blockchains are incapable of communicating with other blockchain networks out-of-the-box. Trust assumptions dictate the risk profile of a particular cross-chain design by shaping its vulnerabilities and delineating how a system can be exploited. Generally speaking, the greater the complexity of a system, the higher its susceptibility to attack. It is therefore preferable to simplify the design of cross-chain solutions in order to limit the number of exploitable components. So, while it is true that trust assumptions are inherent to blockchain interoperability solutions, there is security in simplicity. Read more from our opinion section: There’s no reason to fear open platforms A shared framework for interoperability between blockchain and blockchain-like systems — one that includes architectural guidelines and vetted interface definitions — makes it possible to reduce system complexity. This has the knock-on effect of preventing fragmentation across different project implementations. Even something as simple as common interfaces and functions to decode and verify the validity of messages would go a long way towards enhancing interoperability, while reducing the need for custom implementations. A shared framework for interoperability also has the potential to foster collaboration between different interoperability projects. Broadly speaking, interoperability projects simply don’t trust each others’ work. This isn’t entirely surprising considering that, between 2021 and 2023, more than $2.9 billion was stolen from exploited cross-chain bridges. Nevertheless, this distrust has directly contributed to the fractured state of blockchain interoperability today. A shared framework, built openly and vetted by all, will result in a more secure system. Blockchain interoperability must be core infrastructure first, product second. If we as an industry are to have any hope of achieving the mainstream adoption of blockchain technology (without sacrificing the industry’s core ethos of decentralization), we must establish a shared framework for interoperability.

Despite being far less active than in 2021, the crypto venture sector continues to show renewed vitality. Monad’s raise is the largest crypto venture round since Wormhole’s $225 million haul in November of last year. Electric Capital, Coinbase Capital and several other firms participated. The announcement comes as Solana, which also hopes to offer Ethereum-like features with better throughput, struggles to process the raft of transactions enabled by its low fees. Up to 77% of transactions were dropped instead of included in Solana blocks at times last week. Read more: Solana’s cheap fees are turning out to be a curse — for now When asked about Solana’s dropped transaction debacle, Monad co-founder and CEO Keone Hon gave a lengthy technical explanation. “Sorry this is a very long answer,” Hon parenthesized before diving into how RPC nodes handle spam. The co-founder of crypto’s latest mega-round recipient spent roughly a decade as a traditional finance quant before more recently working at Jump Crypto. At Monad, Hon and co. have generated excitement around an Ethereum Virtual Machine with parallel execution. The EVM is the software that powers Ethereum, a blockchain that can be slow and expensive. Parallel execution executes transactions simultaneously, rather than one at a time. Monad’s parallel EVM can theoretically run much quicker than Ethereum, hitting 10,000 transactions per second in its current “devnet” phase. Ethereum currently handles around 15 TPS, according to Etherscan. The idea of a parallel EVM has won some mindshare in crypto. Haseeb Qureshi, managing partner of Monad backer Dragonfly, said its Monad bet felt like “investing in more than just a team, but an idea,” on X. Dragonfly led Monad Labs’ $19 million seed round in February 2023. Hon said the Monad community is “almost like a Schelling point for really switched on people that care a lot about crypto.” Some Monad critics say it could suffer from state bloat, or inefficiency caused by processing huge amounts of transactions, when released into the wild. Solana also makes use of parallel processing, and it hasn’t wholly escaped the difficulty of scaling. Read more: Parallelized EVMs are gaining popularity, but they won’t scale blockchains alone Hon told Blockworks that the chain is spending time load testing and running edge case scenarios before Monad hits mainnet, a launch slated for later this year, according to Fortune. Monad’s CEO told Blockworks his blockchain will avoid Solana’s current transaction dropping woes because it lacks a scheduler — the piece of Solana that decides how transactions should be ordered in a block. Solana’s scheduler can hit conflicts and have trouble with transactions, Hon said. By contrast, Monad’s transactions are all linear and “there’s no way for transactions to affect other transactions’ actual scheduling.” Due to its scalability, Hon said Monad could be useful for creating consumer crypto apps. A popular app with a million daily active users executing around 50 transactions per day would require a blockchain to process 500 TPS, Hon estimated. “That one app would be half the throughput of Solana and would be 50x the throughput of Ethereum,” Hon said.

Just as the characters in Dune and Shogun navigated intricate webs of alliances and commerce, businesses face similar challenges in today’s complicated global trade landscape. Yet, as supply chains become increasingly complex, it’s blockchain technology that is up to the task of revolutionizing and modernizing trade finance, offering a transformative solution to the persistent trade finance gap. While trade may sound like a complex conversation, two recent releases covering the subject have drawn massive audiences. Dune: Part Two has generated over $490 million at the box office, and Shogun garnered 9 million streaming views globally to become the best worldwide debut to date for a Disney General Entertainment scripted series. Today in the real world, trade also stretches across the globe, creating challenges for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) who need funding to support their operations. The recent rise in interest rates and the tightening of credit has led to more difficulty in managing capital demands — squeezing businesses on both sides of their ledger with higher costs to produce and higher costs to borrow. Current financial institutions are unable to adequately respond to these demands on their own, especially in regions that lack adequate banking. Clearly, the traditional banking system has not caught up with the needs of the global supply chain. Enter blockchain. Blockchain offers financial institutions the ability to leverage distributed ledger technology and digital asset solutions to meet the excessive demand for capital with sufficient supply. For that reason, the most prevalent and impactful use case for blockchain will be in the trade finance industry. The $5 trillion trade finance gap represents the collective difference in the demand for capital and the supply of capital for global shipments, obstructing the flow of funds to where it’s needed most — MSMEs. Mirroring the struggles of those small traders in Shogun’s ancient markets, MSMEs find themselves at a disadvantage due to inefficiencies, lack of visibility and centralized systems that hinder their access to funding. Blockchain, as a decentralized and transparent ledger, emerges as a powerful tool to address the shortcomings of traditional trade finance. It’s clear that the most prevalent and impactful use case for the technology will be in the trade finance industry. Blockchain creates new opportunities — for suppliers, buyers, banks and non-bank originators — and new rails to conduct commerce in real time, all the while carrying immutable data, records, capital and digital representations of real world assets. As governments around the world recognize this potential, blockchain’s role in global trade will become increasingly indispensable. We are seeing this already with the United Nations’ Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records (MLETR), which allows for transferable documents and instruments in electronic form, and other regulatory advancements in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Africa and South America. Unlike in Dune’s Arrakis and Shogun’s shores of feudal Japan, our modern trade networks can flourish and help solve suppliers’ growing demands, even easing pandemic-era disruptions. Blockchain also offers the greatest opportunity for MSMEs, originators and investors — who have been in the global supply chain trenches — to rise above outdated models and create a new vibrant ecosystem for businesses. And when user-friendly interfaces are more widespread, blockchain’s momentum will really be unstoppable. Read more from our opinion section: Blockchain really is better than middlemen With these opportunities, one would think people across the blockchain and crypto spaces would embrace its power to create new rails for businesses to build on and economies to scale. But there seems to be a real misunderstanding of what blockchain’s opportunity holds. Or perhaps there is a lack of understanding of trade finance and its value proposition. By contrast, investing in the hottest dog memecoin is an easy proposition to understand. This is the conundrum of blockchain. Users want the excitement of a fervent market over the slower path toward trade finance adoption. The route is more challenging for protocols to gain traction with those in the space who don’t understand blockchain’s trade finance value proposition. This limiting spirit won’t solve the problem of how to fund MSMEs across the globe and, in turn, feed value back to blockchain networks. In the end, our ethos should be rooted in this question: How do we create a more egalitarian way to help all boats rise, to ensure everyone succeeds? We do it by making blockchain more accessible to more people. Everyone will win — those who want to own a memecoin and those who want to create a better way for businesses across the globe to grow and prosper. Or even those who want both.

75::https://blockworks.co/news/blockchain-better-middlemen-swift ::Blockworks::article::Blockchain really is better than middlemen::Opinion: The SWIFT system's forays into blockchain hint that one day the technology can replace intermediaries.::SWIFT’s forays into blockchain hint that one day the tech can replace intermediaries Soumyabrata Roy/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks The need for an organization connecting all banks is clear in today’s hyper-globalized economy where funds, goods and services are sent across every corner of the globe. So as globalization expanded, our deeply interconnected and centralized financial system triggered the development of SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) in 1973, a member-owned messaging network for financial institutions to send secure communications as well as verify and settle inter-bank transactions. SWIFT connects more than 11 thousand financial institutions across 200 countries and territories — long serving as a unified and stable institution amid a complex and volatile world order. But recently, the exclusion of many sanctioned Iranian and Russian banks from SWIFT prompted China and other nations to launch competing alternative intermediaries. This has led to the wide-scale rethinking of how to structure international finance. While barring certain institutions from SWIFT due to connections with state-sponsored violence, terror or other criminal activity is appropriate, fractionalizing centralized entities into siloed, competing groups poses a long-term threat to global finance. Changing attitudes toward centralized finance and innovative fintech applications further undermine the current financial system and highlight its shortcomings. Meanwhile, the rise of blockchain-based trading solutions has led those in the traditional financial sector to question the role of intermediaries. There is a growing consideration into how this technology can enhance the speed and frequency of interbank transactions. After all, the primary goal of Bitcoin and the broader crypto movement was to eliminate what seemed to be an unjust financial order. This order, dominated by large banks and financial institutions, wielded censorship and control over the world’s population, particularly in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Despite being largely opposed to crypto and blockchain until only a few years ago, financial institutions are now embracing blockchain as a technology, crypto as an investment opportunity and DeFi as a sandbox for innovative financial products. Read more from our opinion section: Bitcoin ETFs in conservative portfolios is good for crypto — and Wall Street This recognition of blockchain’s upside showcases its capability and effectiveness at removing the middleman. Further validating this were recent announcements that SWIFT, in collaboration with more than 12 major financial institutions, is experimenting with interoperable on-chain token transfers and tokenization. Together with SWIFT’s messaging technology, Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) and a public Ethereum testnet are facilitating the routing of messages between legacy banking systems. This alone should legitimize the idea that digital assets and blockchains are legitimate infrastructure components that banks should and will adopt. But it’s not totally clear where this adoption could go from here, as SWIFT’s use of CCIP simply gives an intermediary a new capability in the form of blockchain. It’s widely acknowledged that blockchain technology has the potential to significantly enhance the financial industry’s efficiency by diminishing its reliance on intermediaries. But this current practicality is hindered by the intricate nature of reforming a deeply entrenched, centuries-old system. Rather than pursuing an immediate overhaul, the emphasis should instead shift towards making gradual strides in reducing dependence on these financial intermediaries. The path to replacing intermediaries with blockchain technology necessitates the development of use cases, along with achieving interoperability among various blockchains and traditional banking systems. This requires not only demonstrating the blockchain’s technological benefits — notably its security and cost-effectiveness — in an enterprise setting, but also facilitating interoperability between dozens of unconnected blockchain networks. As siloes of data by design, blockchains are unable to share data or transfer assets among each other. Common mechanisms to boost blockchain interoperability including bridges, sidechains and cross-chain platforms all come with their fair share of complexities, security vulnerabilities and potential compliance challenges. Ensuring limited interoperability and relying on susceptible smart contracts to link diverse blockchain networks pose significant barriers to embracing the technology for financial transactions. The prospect of all financial institutions unanimously adopting the same blockchain network seems unlikely, given the decades-long history of technological infrastructure adoption. Consequently, the necessity for intermediaries, exemplified by the establishment of SWIFT for facilitating cross-bank transactions, becomes evident. But that means the fintech industry, which sits squarely between the finance and blockchain worlds, must develop solutions and protocols to link these isolated data silos. A SWIFT report from August 2023 stated that “firms prefer to leverage their existing infrastructure, manage implementations and proven business processes to connect to blockchain ledgers, where tokens are recorded in a way that is both compliant and secure.” Since financial institutions, understandably, don’t want to abandon their existing infrastructure, the key is to integrate new technologies between systems that use various blockchains. Efficient, loosely coupled integrations among entities and the establishment of a “trusted network” to facilitate the secure exchange of value and data can enable institutions to engage in affordable and convenient transfers. Atomic-swap transactions play a significant role in ensuring that transactions occur smoothly and without errors, especially when dealing with different blockchains and older legacy systems. They help maintain consistency and reliability throughout the transaction lifecycle. Moreover, they also contribute to enhancing overall asset transfer security, especially against threats like unauthorized access attempts and manipulation of data. They do this by establishing a secure communication network that supports essential operations like authentication and encryption. This means that the information and transactions within the system are better protected from potential risks. It’s unlikely that SWIFT’s dominance over the transfer of financial information and messages will be broken soon, but its research into interoperable blockchains and tokenization provides major hope toward reducing the inefficiencies caused by intermediaries — such as delays in transactions, additional costs and fees, dependency risks, lack of transparency and compliance challenges. Recognizing SWIFT as a legitimate and necessary financial institution while building the necessary infrastructure to do what it does but more efficiently, affordably and securely provides the best short-term path toward a future free from middlemen. Regardless of what comes from SWIFT’s experiments with blockchain, institutional adoption of blockchain technology will continue to grow as 97% of institutional investors believe tokenization will revolutionize asset management.

76::https://blockworks.co/news/blockchain-lost-decentralized-spirit ::Blockworks::article::Blockchain has lost its decentralized spirit::Opinion: I often hear, “We will start out centralized, and we will become more decentralized later” — but this is nonsense!::Decentralization must be the cornerstone, not a mere aspiration, of blockchain’s journey Midjourney modified by Blockworks A narrative has taken root in the realm of blockchain technology, one that champions the gradual transition from centralized control to a decentralized future. Yet this story, often recited by those at the helm, overlooks a fundamental truth about power: Once seized, it is rarely surrendered without a struggle. This belief that a centralized beginning can smoothly transition to a decentralized ethos is more myth than reality, akin to convincing a child to relinquish their tight grasp on a coveted sweet. The intention here isn’t to cast venture capitalists or early stakeholders as adversaries — it’s to advocate for a balance, for fairness that underpins the very foundation of blockchain. I often hear, “We will start out centralized, and we will become more decentralized later.” But I believe this is nonsense! One of the hardest things to give up is power. This notion is vividly illustrated by the French Revolution, a historical event that epitomizes the struggle to redistribute power from an entrenched monarchy to a democratic governance structure. Despite the promise of liberty, equality and fraternity, the revolution faced immense resistance from those unwilling to cede control, leading to a turbulent period of conflict and transformation. This historical episode serves as a poignant reminder that once power is acquired, relinquishing it is a far more formidable challenge than many anticipate. As blockchain ventures flourish, the grip of those in control tightens, with early investors and builders basking in the success their influence has wrought. Conversely, during tumultuous times, these same figures embark on campaigns of reassurance, painting over cracks while strategically planning their exits. This stark duality reveals a profound flaw in the prevalent “centralize now, decentralize later” mantra, significantly underestimating the seductive allure of power and the inherent challenges in relinquishing it once established. The promise of distributed authority is at the heart of the blockchain revolution. The reimagining of governance where innovation serves not just the circulation of capital, but empowers and amplifies a multitude of voices (not just those traditionally heard in the corridors of wealth). Yet, a troubling reality overshadows this ideal: A staggering concentration of over 80% of blockchain assets in the hands of a mere 1% of wallets. Regardless of whether these assets make up projects that aim to fully decentralize or not, the fact of the matter is that early stakeholders and VCs often hold the largest piece of the pie for new blockchains simply because they come in first, when it’s riskiest. This imbalance transcends mere issues of fairness, striking at the very viability of blockchains as engines of innovation and inclusivity. It’s a travesty that the vast majority of value creation does not come from this 1%, underscoring a critical disconnect. Those who contribute the most to the ecosystem often have the least say in its direction and the smallest share in its success — those early VCs holding all the tokens do provide impact with their initial investments, but their participation usually stops there. And because the protocol’s governance is based on the ownership of the token, the new builders don’t have the weight to make major decisions by the major token holders. Read more from our opinion section: The worst kind of decentralization is none at all This stark discrepancy isn’t just unfair; it’s fundamentally counterproductive, eroding the incentive for innovators, developers and community members to pour their energy and creativity into the ecosystem. By sidelining the very individuals who are the lifeblood of innovation, blockchain ecosystems risk stagnating, as the centralized accumulation of benefits stifles the diverse input and collaboration essential for breakthroughs and resilience. Such a structure threatens the long-term sustainability and incentive for valuable contributors to remain engaged and invested in these projects. The long-term viability of blockchain technology depends on its ability to foster a genuinely inclusive environment where contributions are recognized and rewarded appropriately, ensuring that all participants have a stake in the ecosystem’s success. Where do we go from here? I believe that many of the first-generation blockchains, the foundational layers that have been the bedrock of the industry, have veered too far off course. Their structures have solidified around centralization to a point where a return to true decentralization might no longer be feasible. This isn’t to say they’re doomed for failure; far from it. The potential of blockchain technology is vast, its future inherently multichain, promising a landscape rich with diverse and interconnected networks. However, we need to start afresh if we want to harness this potential fully. This proposition might seem daunting, yet considering the broader timeline of technological evolution, we’re still in the nascent stages of blockchain development. The beauty of this space is its foundation in open source principles. Almost all blockchain technologies are open to being studied, modified and repurposed. This openness paves the way for new projects to emerge — i.e, reboots of existing chains, each carrying a distinct mission and fostering a unique culture. Embarking on this path isn’t merely about technological innovation; it’s about reimagining the ethos that guides blockchain development. By initiating new projects with decentralization as a core principle, we stand a chance to correct the course. This approach doesn’t merely replicate what came before, but builds upon it, learning from past missteps to create blockchains that are truly from the people, by the people and for the people. To visualize the potential paths of blockchain, consider two atomic reactions: fusion and fission. A blockchain driven by a diverse, invested community is akin to a fusion reactor. It’s efficient, sustainable and produces a continuous outflow of energy. This model represents a decentralized ecosystem where power and rewards are evenly spread, fostering innovation and participation from all stakeholders. The result is a robust and vibrant network, capable of long-term growth and adaptation. In contrast, a network dominated by a few mirrors the principles of a fission bomb: initially powerful, but ultimately leading to destruction. This reflects a centralized blockchain ecosystem, where concentrated power leads to rapid gains that are not sustainable over time. Such a structure can stifle innovation and lead to a fragile system, prone to collapse. This analogy underlines the crucial choice blockchain faces between sustainable growth and short-term gains, emphasizing the need for a decentralized approach to ensure the technology’s long-term viability and success. Decentralization must be the cornerstone, not a mere aspiration, of blockchain’s journey. It’s about democratizing power, fostering a community where everyone’s voice matters and every contribution is valued from the outset. At this pivotal juncture, the trajectory of blockchain hinges on our resolve to anchor it in decentralization from the very beginning. By prioritizing decentralization as our foundational principle, we chart a course toward a future where blockchain serves as a bedrock for equitable growth and democratic engagement. Let’s seize this opportunity to redefine the landscape, ensuring blockchain remains a tool for empowering the many, not just the few. In doing so, we not only realize the full potential of blockchain technology but also contribute to the creation of a fairer, more inclusive world. This is not just the path to technological innovation, but a step towards a more equitable and collaborative ecosystem. We are still early.

77::https://blockworks.co/news/what-is-fully-homomorphic-encryption ::Blockworks::article::What is fully homomorphic encryption and how will it change blockchain?::Fully homomorphic encryption differs from zero-knowledge tech, as it can compute on top of encrypted data without revealing data points.::FHE differs from zero-knowledge technology, as it can perform computation on top of encrypted data without revealing data points Artwork by Crystal Le In today’s digital world, the need to decrypt data for computational tasks exposes it to security risks. This is a significant problem in privacy-sensitive sectors like Web3, where decentralized applications and finance at times rely on both confidentiality and integrity in data processing to maintain trust and security on chain. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) offers a potential solution by enabling the processing of encrypted data without needing to decrypt it first, thus preserving confidentiality. This advancement not only enhances data security and privacy, but also extends the potential for secure data analysis and decentralized services. Guy Itzhaki, CEO and co-founder of Fhenix, says that in the context of blockchain, FHE enables developers and users to control which assets they want to maintain privately and confidentially on-chain. This means that it will enable developers to “create a new set of use cases,” and “unlock the way for true on-chain gaming, voting, and auctions,” Itzahki said. Read more: Encryption startup Fhenix raises $7M for private computation Although there are some similarities between FHE and zero-knowledge (zk) technology, the major difference is that FHE technology can perform computation on top of encrypted data without having to reveal or know the data points to obtain the end result. Liam McDonald, head of growth at blockchain privacy startup Fairblock, explained that with zk technology, a prover turns necessary data into a secure code called a polynomial commitment to show it’s accurate. “In order to do this, the data itself is turned into polynomial hashes and is aggregated into a polynomial equation of the hashes that represents the encoded data,” McDonald told Blockworks. This equation is then sent to a verifier, who determines whether the function is true. If the function is proven, a proof is generated, confirming that the information inside is accurate. Peyman Momeni, co-founder of Fairblock, mentioned that while zk proofs allow users to validate ownership of data or correct computation, they fall short in supporting computations on encrypted data, especially when it involves merging private information from multiple users. “Zk is more relevant for scalability with some degree of security and limited privacy applications like shielded transfers, where FHE unlocks wide range of applications coupled with higher levels of data security and privacy,” Momeni said. When combined with the benefits of the blockchain, FHE provides enhanced privacy, which is a core component that is missing in the existing blockchain ecosystem, said Kaal Dhairya, a Shiba Inu developer. “Apart from true end-to-end encryption of data, this opens up a variety of use cases, including supply chain/food chain to blockchain, private voting for DAOs, efficient prediction markets, on-chain casino games, hidden items in on-chain games, and many more,” Dhairya said. Momeni notes that in most crypto use cases, it is necessary to combine private inputs from multiple users, compute over them and decrypt the results, meaning that there would be a “shared private state.” “As an example in private governance or sealed-bid auctions, all users encrypt their votes or bids, we perform on-chain computing over encrypted data, then in the end we need to decrypt the actual results,” he said. “In this case we don’t actually decrypt the individual bids/votes/trades, just the updated state or the result of computation.” Read more: Fully homomorphic encryption rollups are one step closer to reality To ensure no single user has exclusive access, a system of multiple validators should share this decryption key, and decrypt the information collaboratively at the appropriate time. According to Momeni, current FHE technologies face the technical hurdle of creating a decentralized system for managing these decryption keys. Fairblock, however, is developing a solution with a decentralized network for key generation, aiming to make FHE technology more accessible and practical for developers and various platforms. It’s worth noting that FHE isn’t the only privacy solution being developed on the blockchain today; there are several other solutions that might be more beneficial for developers building different tools. “There are different solutions with different trade-offs, so we’re trying to enable developers to use them correctly without passing a cryptography course,” Momeni said. Read more from our opinion section: Privacy is going mainstream In the case of Fairblock, the company sees itself as being similar to Axelar, Eigenlayer, or Celestia, where a network facilitates and accelerates other builders. “Instead of cross-chain messaging, shared security, and data availability, we’re abstracting away all of the bandwidth overhead, onboarding and maintenance costs of running the network in a secure and decentralized way,” he said. The company recently rolled out its public testnet, which is designed for developers of select layer-2 networks to tailor how they integrate encryption and decryption into applications. It currently enables users to leverage identity-based encryption (IBE), witness encryption (WE) with integration of fully homomorphic encryption still under development.

78::https://blockworks.co/news/nirvana-alternative-to-google-cloud-aws ::Blockworks::article::Nirvana Cloud debuts as blockchain-optimized alternative to AWS and Google Cloud::Nirvana Labs is debuting its Nirvana Cloud computing service meant to work specifically with blockchain workloads.::The startup’s cloud service uses hardware optimized for blockchains Nirvana Labs and Adobe Stock modified by Blockworks Nirvana Labs is debuting its Nirvana Cloud computing service meant to work specifically with blockchain workloads. CEO Dan Burke told Blockworks that the startup raised $1.7 million in pre-seed funding, and counts blockchain platforms like Chainlink and Avalanche as clients. According to Burke, the company is hoping to lure Web3 projects away from more general purpose cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud, which are widely used across many industries, including the crypto space. But Nirvana is not building a decentralized computing platform, a la Golem, nor a decentralized storage solution like IPFS. Rather, it’s taking the centralized status quo and specializing it for Web3. Read more: Researchers use blockchain network to simulate the dawn of life on Earth AWS and Google Cloud provide public cloud services that enable the purchase of resources such as servers and storage via the internet. This arrangement is often cost-effective, as it eliminates the need for companies to maintain their own physical hardware. Blockchain applications tend to be compute-intensive though, which drives up the costs Web3 that companies are paying to public cloud providers. Crypto is big business for Amazon in particular, which hosts 35% of all Ethereum nodes, according to the website ethernodes. Nirvana Cloud says it can offer much reduced costs and better efficiency for blockchain workloads compared to AWS by doing away with unnecessary virtualization. In computing, virtualization allows for the creation of virtual machines (VMs) that operate independently from their underlying physical hardware. This essentially turns one physical computer into many virtual ones, allowing each to run its own tasks as if it were a separate machine. In short, virtualization makes it possible to run many different applications and processes without needing multiple physical computers. This lets cloud service providers offer a more efficient and flexible service to customers. But traditional services like AWS and Google Cloud, while versatile, often adopt a general-purpose approach that may not be as cost or resource-efficient for specific applications, like the energy-intensive ones found in Web3. Read more: Cloud computing is operated by an anti-competitive oligopoly, says Osuri Nirvana Labs addresses this by reducing the virtualization layer. It slims down the middleman software and focuses its hardware on the specific needs of Web3 technologies, like cryptocurrency transactions or smart contracts. The result is a setup that’s not just faster and more reliable for these tasks, but also more cost-effective. A Nirvana Labs document reviewed by Blockworks suggests that, for a setup with two virtual CPUs and 8 gigabytes of RAM, Nirvana Cloud costs about 19.5% less than AWS and 26.91% less than Google Cloud Platform per month. According to the company, Nirvana Cloud distinguishes itself by offering a “bare metal” cloud service. Unlike typical cloud environments where server resources are shared among multiple consumers, each Nirvana server is dedicated to a single client. This approach, where hardware resources are not pooled, is meant to ensure superior performance for computation-heavy tasks, like blockchain validation, by maximizing the efficiency and reliability of the service. Read more: Google Cloud eyes more involvement in fast-evolving Web3 segment However, some would argue that solutions like Nirvana’s don’t go far enough — and that computing resources will always be a risk for crypto unless the base layer is decentralized. “We have decentralized payments. We have decentralized storage. We have to have decentralized compute or else this whole decentralized world isn’t really decentralized,” Tom Trowbridge, co-founder of decentralized computing platform Fluence, said. But in the interim, increased scrutiny on the cloud layer couldn’t hurt. Burke said that the Web3 development world often doesn’t think enough about what’s happening at the tech’s layer zero. He jokingly added, “I mean, we have a company in the space called LayerZero that’s literally built on Google Cloud.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

79::https://blockworks.co/news/blockchain-transparency-bug::Blockworks::article::Blockchain transparency is a bug::Opinion: Blockchain transparency is making Web3 the surveillance tool it was meant to free societies from.::Blockchain transparency is making Web3 the surveillance tool it was meant to free societies from Artwork by Crystal Le Blockchain transparency is a bug. Transparency isn’t a feature of decentralization that is truly needed to perform on-chain transactions securely — it’s a bug that forces Web3 users to expose their most sensitive financial data to anyone who wants to see it. Several blockchain marketing tools have emerged over the past few years, allowing marketers and salespeople to use the freely flowing on-chain data for user insights and targeted advertising. But this time, it’s not just behavioral data that is analyzed. Now, your most sensitive financial information is also added to the mix. Web3 will never become mainstream unless we manage to solve this transparency problem. Blockchain and Web3 were an escape from centralized power, making information transparent so that centralized entities cannot own one’s data. Then 2020 came, Web3 and NFTs boomed, and many started talking about how free flowing, available-to-all data is a clear improvement from your data being “stolen” by big data companies as a customer. Some may think if everyone can see the data, transparency will empower users to take ownership of and profit from their own data. Yet, transparency does not mean data can’t be appropriated nor that users are really in control. The fact that data is transparent and flowing freely doesn’t mean it cannot be appropriated; in fact, data appropriation is already happening in Web3. Many are taking advantage of all of this open data to simplify on-chain data analysis and monetize it for anyone interested in learning the behavioral patterns of Web3 users. With the immense number of transactions and wallets, the large volume of data becomes a goldmine for those skilled enough to understand it. Transparency opened doors for Web2’s profiling practices to enter Web3. Tools like Nansen or Addressable help agencies and advertisers gather transactional and asset-held data to analyze consumer behavior and holdings to understand trends, create potential customer profiles and launch targeted advertising programs. Privacy projects will argue that total privacy as a given is the only way to protect users. Yet, they aren’t right either. Users already need — and increasingly will need — to use their on-chain data to verify holdings and transactions for regulatory purposes and verifications. If everything is private and cannot be selectively encrypted, there is no way to verify the funds and their origins. Many such privacy solutions have already been sanctioned by governments. Read more from our opinion section: Ethereum L2s are a bug masquerading as a feature At the same time, users might want to proudly showcase some of their assets (like NFTs). But this doesn’t mean they want to allow everyone else to peek into all their other crypto holdings and transactions (which they do, since an address holding a certain NFT can be checked). Take 50 people holding NFTs for one project, analyze their other holdings and trends across transactional patterns, and you have a pretty accurate user profile you can target. Web3 needs to shift from the appropriation of freely flowing data to a data ownership model, where users get full control over what data gets shared, with whom, when and how. Vitalik Buterin addressed this transparency problem, posing a similar solution in his September paper on blockchain privacy and regulatory compliance. He argued that transparency is a security issue and showed there is a way to allow Web3 to be compliant and transparent only when needed. The solutions and the technology to make this shift are here. What is now needed is a change in user mindset and awareness that this transparency bug exists. Blockchain transparency is making Web3 become the surveillance tool it was meant to free societies from. It poses a growing concern, especially as the popularity of community rewards platforms increases and more and more users are combining their wallet addresses with social media accounts. The Web3 crowd needs to be educated about the risks of keeping all their data out in the open. In the decentralized world, the change needs to happen bottom-up as people realize how their blockchain transactions are being monetized for uses they have no control over.

80::https://blockworks.co/news/blockchain-mainstream-adoption-history::Blockworks::article::Blockchain is one step away from mainstream adoption::Opinion: We’re months and years, not decades, away from widespread Web3 adoption.::What could come next for Web3 is grounded in history — and completely unpredictable Artwork by Crystal Le There’s plenty going on with crypto and blockchain right now. But the biggest news of the year is still the Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval of spot bitcoin ETFs — with $4.5 billion in trading volume in the first 24 hours, all eyes are on how this new investment vehicle will impact public engagement with crypto and blockchain. Because even though blockchain technology has been in use (and in the public discourse) for over a decade, it’s still accurate to compare its progress to the early days of the internet. Its nascent point in evolution — and clear potential for eventual disruption — echoes Clayton M. Christensen’s disruptive innovation theory, a theory which highlights how technologies overturn established markets. No matter how revolutionary or unique, fresh innovation remains intrinsically tied to the past. By learning lessons from pioneering technologies that are now accepted as core to life and society, we can navigate the complexities of this next great technological shift. While there will be challenges in acceptance and utility along the way, I believe blockchain’s path to imminent mass adoption closely mirrors the innovation cycles of past technologies with humble, then astronomical trajectories. And the SEC’s spot bitcoin ETF approval is a moment that signals both validation and acceleration. Let me explain. Like the nascent stages of both the internet and cloud computing, blockchain’s initial phase was marked by enthusiasm tempered with challenges. Early blockchain adopters — akin to pioneers of cloud infrastructure — faced skepticism, technological hurdles and a lack of clear market fit. Data from the early 2010s reflects a burgeoning interest in blockchain but also reveals the struggles for finding practical applications and widespread adoption. It was during this period that the cryptocurrency space became the primary use case for blockchain technology. Bitcoin’s rise sparked curiosity and fueled on-chain experimentation. But while the promise of decentralized, trustless systems captivated innovators, its practical implementation faced numerous obstacles. Scalability issues, regulatory uncertainties and the association of blockchain with volatile cryptocurrency markets hindered its broader adoption. Blockchain technology was truly in its infancy in the early 2010s. And as with every groundbreaking innovation, overcoming the initial challenges required time, perseverance and a commitment to refining the technology’s capabilities. Within two to three years, blockchain technology expanded from testing labs and hackathons to real world business applications used by global giants like IBM and Maersk. In making the leap relatively quickly, the tech entered a phase akin to the dot-com era’s consolidation — where performance, utility and UX took out the first wave of providers failing to meet enterprise, developer and user expectations. During this period, blockchain gained crucial market recognition and investment growth, and its solutions began to demonstrate real-world utility. The industry also witnessed the emergence of alternative blockchain platforms like Ethereum, each offering unique features and addressing the limitations of earlier iterations. The mid-2010s also marked a turning point for blockchain, with a surge in enterprise adoption and a notable influx of tech industry attention anchored largely by progressive larger companies and startups. Although regulatory frameworks began to take shape around the world, country-specific dynamics remained in the path of providing a more stable environment for businesses to explore and implement blockchain technology. In both the dot-com era internet and blockchain during this phase, viable business models emerged — and along with them, substantial investments that lay the foundation for long-term sustainability. Like dot-com, blockchain was experiencing cracks at the seams as the underlying infrastructure and technology transitioned swiftly from a speculative concept to a legitimate technological innovation vulnerable to system failures, user sentiment and industry scrutiny. In other words, the enterprise, commercial and potential user spotlight was on, but the backend infrastructure remained painfully slow and the frontend UX remained noticeably lacking. Blockchain’s current phase mirrors the cloud computing industry’s evolution from nascent testing group populated with startups and risk-taking enterprises into a market staple with room to improve. While there’s still significant progress to make in terms of adoption and onboarding, processing, security, interoperability and UX, the advancements happening on blockchain today are nearing web grade and web scale. Today, blockchain technology underpins applications across industries, from finance to supply chain management — and this is only the beginning. Recent market analyses highlight blockchain’s expanding footprint, indicating its transition from an emerging technology to an integral part of the global digital infrastructure akin to cloud in Web2. In my opinion, we’re months and years, not decades, away from people around the world using Web3 to make financial transactions, scroll social media and play games at Web2 speeds — with UX at a level where users might not realize their digital experience is made possible by blockchain. Blockchain’s growth is already reshaping traditional business processes and models. In the financial sector, blockchain facilitates faster and more secure transactions. Supply chain management benefits from increased transparency and traceability, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of products. Smart contracts automate and streamline complex agreements, minimizing the risk of fraud and error. And in addition to sparking rising trading volumes, the SEC’s approval of spot bitcoin ETFs sent a global signal of validation to governments reviewing the viability of blockchain applications in both the private and public sectors. Importantly, the evolution of blockchain has given credence to — and bestowed practicality upon — the concept of decentralized finance (DeFi). We’re already in a reality where traditional financial services are replicated, and even improved, using blockchain technology. This is transformative because it will eliminate the need for intermediaries, opening the door to financial participation for virtually anyone with internet access. This democratization of finance has the potential to provide financial services to underserved populations and redefine the global financial landscape. Today (literally today), blockchain technology sits at the brink of a new era of the internet — one fueled by decentralized ecosystems at web scale. As we move forward, businesses, policymakers and builders will increasingly search out responsible, interoperable and secure blockchains that have a proven ability to scale and meet the needs of millions worldwide who will be using it daily. Most importantly, we can build a more transparent, efficient and inclusive digital world in the process. Mo Shaikh is the Co-Founder & CEO of Aptos Labs.

81::https://blockworks.co/news/blockchain-ai-misleading-narrative::Blockworks::article::What can blockchain do for AI? Not what you’ve heard.::Opinion: AI and blockchain put together aren’t actually that good at combating misinformation and improving privacy just yet.::In reality, many of the oft-touted uses for bringing blockchain and AI together aren’t actually all that useful Stokkete/Modified by Blockworks Industries everywhere are asking “What can AI do for us?” But the blockchain industry, known for challenging norms, is also asking the opposite question: “What can blockchain do for AI?” While there are some compelling answers, three narratives have emerged around this question that are frequently misleading and, in one case, potentially even hazardous. An expert panel at a recent Coinbase event concluded that “blockchain can counter misinformation with cryptographic digital signatures and timestamps, making it clear what’s authentic and what’s been manipulated.” This is true only in a very narrow sense. Blockchains can record digital-media creation in a tamper-proof way, i.e., so that modification of specific images is detectible. But this is a far cry from clarifying authenticity. Consider a photo of a flying saucer hovering above the Washington Monument. Suppose that someone has registered its creation in, say, block 20,000,000 of the Ethereum blockchain. This fact tells you one thing: The flying saucer image was created before block 20,000,000. Additionally, whoever posted the image to the blockchain — let’s call her Alice — did so by digitally signing a transaction. Assuming that Alice’s signing key wasn’t stolen, it’s clear that Alice registered the photo on the blockchain. None of this, however, tells you how the image was created. It might be a photo that Alice snapped with her own camera. Or Alice might have gotten the image from Bob, who Photoshopped it. Or maybe Carol created it with a generative AI tool. In short, the blockchain tells you nothing about whether aliens were touring Washington, D.C.—unless you already trust Alice to begin with. Some cameras can digitally sign photos to authenticate them (assuming their sensors can’t be fooled, which is a big if), but this isn’t blockchain technology. Model training is a data-hungry operation. The bigger and better the training data set, the better the resulting model. For many applications, training on private user data is essential. For instance, creating a good machine-learning model to diagnose medical conditions requires data from a population of real patients. Handling such highly sensitive data securely is a challenge. Some are trumpeting blockchain technologies as a solution. Blockchains, however, are designed for transparency — a property at odds with confidentiality. Proponents point to privacy-enhancing technologies advanced by the blockchain industry to address this tension — especially zero-knowledge proofs. Zero-knowledge proofs, however, don’t solve the problem of privacy in AI model training. That’s because a zero-knowledge proof doesn’t conceal secrets from whoever is constructing the proof. Zero-knowledge proofs are helpful if I want to conceal my transaction data from you. But they don’t enable me to compute privately over your data. There are other, more relevant cryptographic and security tools with esoteric names, including fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), secure multiparty computation (MPC) and secure enclaves. These can in principle support privacy-preserving AI (specifically, “federated learning”). Each has important caveats, though. And claiming them as blockchain-specific technologies would be a stretch. Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, has noted that bots are already performing transactions using cryptocurrency and tweeted that “AI and Blockchains are made for each other.” This is true in the sense that cryptocurrency is a good match for the capabilities of AI agents. But it’s also worrisome. Many people fret about AI agents escaping human control. Classic nightmare scenarios involve autonomous vehicles killing people or AI-powered autonomous weapons going rogue. But there’s another vector of escape: The financial system. Money equals power. Give that power to an AI agent and it can do real damage. This problem is the topic of a research paper that I co-authored in 2015/6. My colleagues and I examined the possibility of smart contracts, programs that autonomously intermediate transactions on Ethereum, being used to facilitate crime. Using the techniques in that paper and a blockchain oracle system with access to LLMs (Large Language Models) such as ChatGPT, bad actors could in principle launch “rogue” smart contracts that automatically pay bounties for committing serious crimes. Read more from our opinion section: How a smart contract gets away with murder: A review of ‘The Oracle’ Happily, rogue smart contracts of this kind aren’t yet possible in today’s blockchains — but the blockchain industry and crypto enthusiasts will need to take AI safety seriously as a future concern. They will need to consider mitigations, such as community-driven interventions or guardrails in oracles to help enforce AI safety. The integration of blockchains and AI does hold clear promise. AI may add unprecedented flexibility to blockchain systems by creating natural language interfaces to them. Blockchains may provide new financial and transparency frameworks for model training and data sourcing and put the power of AI in the hands of communities, not just enterprises.

The NCLA, TBC, and Riot were granted a 14-day temporary restraining order late Friday, blocking the DOE and the Energy Information Administration from requiring bitcoin mining companies to hand over information as part of an emergency survey the EIA announced earlier this year. Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council, told Blockworks that the TBC remains “confident that we have a sound legal case.” “We’re concerned that a benign agency like the Energy Information Administration would be politicized in this way, it doesn’t bode well for other industries that potentially could fall out of favor with the administration and power,” he added. The complaint, filed last week, said that miners would be “irreparably harmed” by the survey, which demanded “confidential, sensitive and proprietary information.” “We will specifically focus on how the energy demand for cryptocurrency mining is evolving, identify geographic areas of high growth, and quantify the sources of electricity used to meet cryptocurrency mining demand,” Joe DeCarolis, administrator for the EIA, said in a statement last month. Read more: Crypto miner ire over EIA survey bubbles over to the courtroom The request, which was filed as an emergency order earlier this month, came after the cold snap that impacted parts of the US. “Given the emerging and rapidly changing nature of this issue and because EIA cannot quantitatively assess the likelihood of public harm, EIA felt a sense of urgency to generate credible data that would provide insight into this unfolding issue,” an EIA spokesperson told Blockworks back in early February. The NCLA, in a press release Friday, said that the EIA “appears to be responding to political pressure rather than a genuine ‘emergency’ implicating public harm.” In the order granting the TRO, the court wrote that it believed that the plaintiffs are “likely” to show that the justification for the emergency order request fell “short.” Before the order, the EIA — on its website and on X — clarified that it wouldn’t be enforcing the survey until March 22. Bratcher told Blockworks that TBC is “in this [fight] for our members and the industry and have no inclination to back away from what we think is a very correct cause.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

They used “prebiotic feedstocks” like water and nitrogen to trace how early compounds eventually led to human existence. The researchers, operating out of the Institute of Organic Chemistry in Poland, first published an article in Science in 2020 in which they created a version of this network — albeit one with limitations. The Golem network, operating as a layer-2 distributed computing platform, enabled the researchers to construct a network that was 100,000 times larger than their initial attempt. Read more: We need to decentralize science In a paper published in the academic journal Chem, the researchers detail how this “counterintuitive marriage” between crypto and origins of life research allowed them to pull off a far bigger version of the network without needing access to supercomputing resources. Golem’s network operates on a peer-to-peer basis, where individuals can rent out their idle computing power in exchange for GLM tokens, the native cryptocurrency of the Golem network. The researchers simulated 11 billion reactions comprising 20,000 CPU cores on Golem. They paid out 82,000 GLM to the computing power providers which translated to roughly $38,000 at the time. At GLM’s current price, the tokens would be worth roughly $17,000. In the article, the research team estimates that running the simulation with Web2 cloud providers would have cost $80,000. Crowdfunding-like approaches to academic research are one of crypto’s burgeoning use cases. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has been selling off 2% of his COIN equity to fund ResearchHub.

Read more: FinCEN seeks tighter controls on crypto mixing services Mixing is a process that blends different crypto transactions to obscure the original source — making it more difficult to trace specific transactions. FinCEN director Andrea Gacki said in an October statement that crypto mixing “allows players in the ransomware ecosystem, rogue state actors and other criminals to fund their unlawful activities and obfuscate the flow of ill-gotten gains.” Marisa Coppel, head of legal at Blockchain Association, said in a statement that FinCEN’s proposal is “far too broad in scope and application.” In a Jan. 22 letter responding to the proposal, the Blockchain Association argued that FinCEN’s failure to consider the many legitimate uses of crypto mixing makes it “makes it impossible for the agency to rationally conclude that the class is of primary money laundering concern.” “CVC mixing protocols help law-abiding individuals achieve on the otherwise public blockchain the privacy typical of transactions in the traditional banking system,” the group wrote. “There is nothing inherently suspicious about desiring the same degree of privacy available for traditional financial transactions.” FinCEN’s decision to impose reporting requirements on CVC mixing transactions “will stigmatize broad swathes of legitimate digital asset activity, impose significant costs on the digital asset industry and drive illicit digital asset transactions abroad,” Blockchain Association added. Coinbase also challenged the proposal in a Jan. 22 letter. The crypto exchange noted that regulated virtual asset service providers (VASPs) are already required to file suspicious activity reports on illicit mixing activity. “The NPRM fails to explain why these existing requirements are inadequate to FinCEN’s purposes,” Coinbase wrote. The company added in the letter that the FinCEN proposal does not include any monetary threshold for record-keeping and reporting obligations — leading to “bulk reporting of data of little help to law enforcement.” FinCEN could not immediately be reached. The FinCEN proposal comes after the US Treasury Department added decentralized cryptocurrency mixing service Tornado Cash to its sanctions list in August 2022. A year later, the company’s co-founders, Roman Semenov and Roman Storm, were charged with US federal money laundering and sanctions violations. Read more: Tornado Cash plaintiffs seek appeals after federal court losses Coinbase is no stranger to challenging federal agencies amid a broader crackdown on the crypto space. The publicly traded crypto company remains in a legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission after the regulator last year sued Coinbase for allegedly operating as an unregistered exchange — claims the company has denied. “This [proposal] comes at a time of enormous opportunity for the United States to lead the world in digital asset innovation,” Coinbase wrote in its latest letter to FinCEN. “But this opportunity depends in significant part on US regulators, like FinCEN, creating a regulatory landscape that fosters the growth of compliant companies while holding accountable those that fail to meet their obligations.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

87::https://blockworks.co/news/parallelized-evms-gaining-popularity::Blockworks::article::Parallelized EVMs are gaining popularity, but they won't scale blockchains alone::Parallel execution is a small fraction of the bigger picture.::Parallel execution is a small fraction of the bigger picture absemetov/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks Improving technology for scaling blockchains requires tackling multifaceted problems. New attempts to parallelize the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) have gained interest in recent weeks, as developers look for possibilities to increase transaction throughput. The EVM is the execution environment that runs on Ethereum and its layer-2 rollups, and also has been adopted by other layer-1 networks such Avalanche, Binance Chain and many others, which use it to process smart contract code. In typical EVM implementations, transactions are processed one after the other in the order they arrive. This simple approach can lead to longer processing times and higher costs when there are many transactions, explains Marina Guryeva, the CEO of Neon Labs, which is implementing the EVM as a smart contract on Solana. “For Ethereum, the traditional sequential execution model simplifies hardware requirements, but on the downside, it creates limitations in handling the increasing volume of transactions,” Guryeva told Blockworks. “This worsens during peak usage times resulting in longer transaction wait times, higher gas fees vis-a-vis demand surge, and an overall fractured user experience.” Guryeva said that much of the growing interest in parallel EVMs is due to its ability to tackle these challenges around blockchain scalability, addressing issues related to the blockchain trilemma. “The parallel processing approach addresses the longstanding challenges of scalability and transaction processing efficiency within the Ethereum network,” Guryeva said. Many transactions can be processed at the same time, instead of sequentially, so long as they don’t depend on each other. There are other ways to achieve parallel processing, such as at the database-level with approaches such as sharding, that essentially divide Ethereum’s state into smaller “shards” but full sharding remains years away. Read more: Dencun and Pralectra: Ethereum core devs chart an ambitious 2024 Parallelized EVMs, however, including the likes of Sei network, Monad and Neon, are already production ready or nearly so. The Sei network launched its mainnet in August 2023 and has seen recent monthly trading volume of about $136 million with a little over 29 thousand active DEX users, according to data compiled by Flipside Crypto. Its native token, SEI, has surged from around $0.23 at the beginning of December to around $0.68 today — an almost 200% jump. Neon too, has seen a significant increase in its token price, with NEON trading from $0.50 on Dec. 1 to roughly $2.55 today. Monad has yet to launch and does not yet have its own token. Much of the work being done on the Neon EVM is to bring the Ethereum dapps into the Solana ecosystem, Guryeva said. “It is a fully compatible Ethereum environment on Solana and allows developers to scale Ethereum dapps using Solana as the settlement layer,” she said. Guryeva notes that Ethereum remains the dominant blockchain that supports smart contracts and dapps, but Solana’s Sealevel technology — which enables virtual machines to process multiple transactions simultaneously through distributing transaction workload across multiple threads on a validator’s hardware — enables lower gas fees and higher scalability. Jay Jog the co-founder of Sei Labs shares this sentiment, he notes that Ethereum rollups struggle to get over 30 sustained transactions per second, which limits the design space on the blockchain. “A parallelized EVM lets you get the best of Ethereum and Solana — the EVM and all of the mindshare/tooling around it and the fast execution environment that Solana offers,” he said. Sei’s latest version has its EVM built into the chain, Jog added. “Sei uses Geth — the Go implementation of the EVM — to get full EVM bytecode compatibility. Geth is very battle tested and currently processes ~85% of [Ethereum] blocks,” he said. This is different from its competitor Monad, which is creating a custom EVM implementation, Jog notes. Despite these differences, both Monad and Sei are using optimistic parallel execution to achieve parallel processing. With this technique, virtual machines run in parallel on separate threads within the network computer. Each thread would execute transactions and generate what Keone Hon, the co-founder and CEO of Monad Labs, calls “pending results.” These pending results track the inputs and outputs of the transactions which are then committed back into their original linear order. If any pending result has inputs that have been invalidated, then a transaction must be rescheduled. “This means that Monad still supports linear blocks and linear transactions within the blocks,” Hon told Blockworks. “Monad can basically take transaction formats that are exactly the same as Ethereum and then, under the hood, implement parallelism without any changes from the user perspective.” Optimistic parallel execution is different from what Solana uses, for example, where dapps have to pre-specify dependencies of the transactions, Hon said, analogous to the access list approach on Ethereum. It is important to note, Hon adds, that parallel execution is a small fraction of the bigger picture, with Monad’s more general mission being centered around accelerating EVM execution to make it as performant as possible. “The real bottleneck is actually the state access that all of those transactions are being run, they all have dependencies on state, and that state lives on SSD (solid-state drive),” Hon said. The majority of smart contract work has relatively simple computation, he said, and bigger constraints for smart contracts are often the input/output component — the process of reading from the SSD and then writing back data. Parallelism only cuts a small fraction of costs, according to Rachel Bousfield, the tech lead at Offchain Labs, because parallel execution is rarely possible in practice across current Web3 dapps. Ethereum-like blockchains generally use commodity databases for reading and writing data. These have the advantage of being widely accessible, purchased “off the shelf,” but they are not optimized for the problem of storing the Merkle tree data, necessary for parallel processing on the blockchain, Hon notes. This means that, fundamentally, in order to decrease transaction processing times and gas prices, infrastructure around the database will have to change. “So one of the other really major things that Monad is building is a custom state database from scratch that supports parallel access so that when there are many threads running in parallel, touching the database — to get inputs, or write outbacks back to it — those can proceed in parallel,” Hon said. Monad is not alone in focusing on alleviating state dependencies. Sei too, is working to make improvements in this area, Jog notes. “We are doing a lot of work on the state layer to improve state access, state commit, and state storage,” he said.

88::https://blockworks.co/news/we-need-to-stop-forcing-use-cases-on-blockchains::Blockworks::article::We need to stop forcing use cases on blockchains::Opinion: The idea that existing generic blockchains can later be molded for specific use cases lacks foresight.::The idea that existing generic blockchains can later be molded for specific use cases lacks foresight Midjourney modified by Blockworks Every industry is unique, with its own needs, quirks and customer demands. The Web3 industry is no exception — especially on the quirky front. The prevailing mode of action in the industry so far has been to build general-purpose blockchains in the hopes that folks will later build specific layer-2 functionalities for them. But the idea that existing generic blockchains can later be molded for specific use cases lacks foresight. We’ve made great progress with generalized blockchains like Ethereum, as the growth of DeFi and NFTs so clearly demonstrated. But that approach isn’t sustainable — scaling has been and still is one of Ethereum’s most challenging tasks. In order to correctly prepare for the future of blockchain and shape blockchains for the future, we need to stop anchoring our thinking in what already exists. Rather than maintaining established blockchains as the blueprint for specific apps and use cases, we need blockchains that are purpose-made and use case-driven. The era of generalized “smart contract platforms” is coming to a close. The space is already moving steadily in that direction. Appchain protocols like Polkadot, Cosmos and Avalanche are embracing the change in full. But even layer-2 rollups, the hottest chain narrative of the moment, are a first step towards this future of specialization. Optimism’s OP Stack is a clear contender as a framework for deploying custom EVM rollups. With time, additional capabilities beyond the EVM can be developed on rollups as well, as we’re seeing with Arbitrum’s Stylus. We’ve observed this drive towards specialization countless times: from smartphones, computers to social media and the hundreds of different SaaS platforms catering to specific niches. We need to remember that Web3, blockchain or crypto (whichever is your nickname of choice) are all-encompassing terms for an industry that is actually made up of dozens of sectors and niches. These sectors connect and collaborate (they interoperate!), forming a cohesive whole while maintaining their distinctive characteristics and use cases. Industry observers may point to many formerly successful companies as examples of how a myopic vision led to the demise of a number of former market leaders. Kodak, Blockbuster and Nokia all forfeited dominance to products that had better, more-attuned-to-consumer use cases with a clearer grasp of the future. The infrastructure for custom blockchain apps is in development, but now the burden is on app developers to start building them for their own custom uses. And this has the potential to unlock true adoption of blockchain as a means to an end — not the goal in itself. Take the example of Bitcoin. With Taproot and Ordinals, people have been trying to jerry-rig tokens and NFTs to the poor Bitcoin blockchain, which was never even close to being designed for such uses. It’s okay if Bitcoin is just a store of value and payments blockchain. Anything else would eventually be outcompeted by a blockchain specifically built for that purpose. In recent years, we’ve seen a true flourish of smart contract uses in the form of DeFi, GameFi and NFTs. Still, despite some undeniable success, all popular smart contract use cases involve some form of speculation, which becomes unreliable when market conditions are still infamously volatile (though secretly beloved). The types of future applications that will use custom blockchains will be varied, but in my view, it will be much more B2B focused than before. Many such uses are currently locked behind clunky infrastructure and expensive storage. For example, a blockchain for Big Data analytics incorporates the needs of data scientists for data warehousing, SQL, verifying outputs and much more. Imagine every industry has its own custom-built blockchain. There are already examples where this is working; IBM offers custom blockchain solutions for supply chain networks. The idea of blockchain as a sandbox for industries — from travel to IT to fintech — to build in is rapidly being adopted by some of the most established tech powerhouses. It’s time to stop thinking about how we can mold a blockchain to a certain use case, and instead think about how to build a blockchain to fit what we’re trying to build. This isn’t always simple, and it certainly isn’t easy to convince everyone of this view. To borrow a line from Steve Jobs, “a lot of times, people don’t know what they want until you show it to them.” It may not always work — using blockchain for your coffee maker startup is probably not wise — but it will help ambitious and creative founders to find meaningful reasons to use blockchain, the right way.

This new tool is designed to establish the authenticity and origin of digital content. The initiative responds to the increasing challenges presented by artificial intelligence-generated media, seeking to provide a reliable verification system across the digital landscape. An Axios report said FOX plans to use the tool to make licensing more straightforward for the training of generative AI tools trained on large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. Verify came out of FOX’s Blockchain Creative Labs, which is incorporated under the FOX-owned streaming service Tubi. Blockchain Creative Labs formerly tinkered with NFT integrations in the FOX ecosystem before this latest venture into AI applications. In a blog post accompanying the release, Tubi CEO Paul Cheesbrough said Verify was “somewhat inspired by” the AI optimism of a16z head Marc Andreessen, who wrote favorably about the potential for cryptographic signatures to prevent malicious AI content. Cheesbrough also said Verify could create a repository to iron out licensing wrinkles between news outlets and AI developers who train models using media content. Notably, The New York Times alleged copyright infringement from OpenAI in a late December lawsuit. The Times claimed that millions of its articles were used to train OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot without compensation. Verify uses digital signatures to allow publishers to put media on-chain, making it easier for everyone to trace the original source of the content. News organizations can upload articles, for instance, which are turned into NFTs through Ethereum’s ERC-6150 standard. ERC-6150s are “hierarchical” NFTs that are useful for putting things like social media on-chain. With Verify, the public can use the unique token ID of these NFTs to find out the original source of any given piece of content recorded to the protocol. This is particularly useful in a world where AI and other technologies can easily copy and disseminate information without readily apparent citation. For now, the Verify Tool’s beta interface only supports FOX-owned outlets. The company has minted over 80,000 pieces of content, Axios reported. Axios said FOX is in talks with other media outlets to begin using the tool. A source with knowledge of the matter said Verify’s code was made open source in hopes that developers would build other applications on top of the protocol. Whether or not Verify can gain meaningful adoption outside of the FOX ecosystem, it may indicate a place for blockchain in AI development. “Following generative AI’s meteoric rise in 2023, we’re going to see a more transparency-focused approach to the technology this year,” Niraj Pant, founder of crypto-adjacent AI startup Ritual, said in a direct message. Verify is built on Polygon, a decision Cheesbrough says was made because of the chain’s scaling prowess. FOX’s Verify represents the first attempt by a major media company to use blockchain for AI development. Illia Polosukhin, co-founder of NEAR Protocol, thinks potential adoption of the tool by news organizations could prove blockchain technology’s bona fides to a wider audience. “I think the biggest benefit we can see is removing some stigma from mass media around crypto,” Polosukhin said.

After plummeting to lows of $16,000 following the collapse of FTX in November 2022, bitcoin surpassed $43,000 in December 2023 as part of a rally that some say is just beginning. But my hope is that crypto’s persistent reputation for volatility doesn’t tarnish the perceived value of blockchain’s underlying technology. As we go into 2024, I’m optimistic that the inherent capabilities of distributed ledger technology will extend beyond mere market action. Assessing blockchain’s worth solely through the lens of profit performance overlooks the broader utility and transformative potential of Web3. In other words, one should not judge the merits of an entire technology based on how much BONK they lost. In September, blockchain data company Chainalysis released its 2023 Global Adoption Index. The purpose of this report was to recognize “leaders of grassroots crypto adoption,” and to identify the countries where average, everyday people are putting the greatest share of their wealth into cryptocurrency. The results were promising. Of the 20 countries listed, many belong to emerging market economies transitioning from lower incomes and rates of development toward rapid expansion of trade and investment flows. Personally, I’d like to believe that the growing adoption of digital currencies reinforces the technology that underlies it. What’s all the hype about? You lean into it. You go from having a MetaMask wallet and visiting a Bitcoin ATM to reading a few articles and understanding the properties of blockchain that afford secure, public transactions of data and information. You learn about Satoshi’s motivations behind digital assets not as a way to make the rich richer, but to disrupt power-hungry institutions standing in the way of autonomy and democratic financial access. Yes, blockchain is typically associated with its range of financial use cases. But the decentralized, permissionless and non-sovereign technology has, at its core, a social and reformist potential. My hypothesis is that greater grassroots adoption and understanding of crypto assets generates room for uses that capitalize on blockchain to effect change beyond the strictly financial realm. In looking beyond bitcoin rallies and new exchange offerings, other dynamic applications of blockchain come to life. Chainalysis’ 2023 index signals the presence of audiences keen to engage and capture the broader social value that blockchain offers — highlighting Web3 projects that are exceeding blockchain’s financial boundaries to drive cultural and socioeconomic transformations around the world. Nigeria: Akowe, meaning “clerk” in Yoruba, is a one-man Lagos-based startup using blockchain to issue and verify academic records. Almost all certificates issued by Nigerian tertiary institutions are physical hard copies. Coupled with high unemployment rates, certificate forgeries have become increasingly commonplace. Employers and HR firms bear the brunt of high verification costs needed to ensure the credibility of academic records, resulting in verification processes taking anywhere between two weeks to six months. Akowe’s mission is to introduce digital certificates to educators and Nigerian learning institutions, using blockchain to facilitate a tamper-proof and easily verifiable system of digital academic records. While Akowe previously operated using permissioned blockchain Hyperledger, Agboola is now exploring Amazon’s new ledger database solution QLDB, which allows organizations to create centrally managed records. The startup has piloted its project with two institutions and is actively engaged in discussions with 15 other universities, indicating a growing interest in the blockchain-based verification solution to reduce complexities within the current education sector. India: Web3 middleware SaaS start-up Airchains is partnering with West Bengal’s New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) to digitize land ownership using NFTs. The presumption of land ownership in India is complicated by different jurisdictional processes. Conflicting title investigations and lost paperwork creates glaring inconsistencies in the maintenance of land records, impeding the Indian real estate market and often making land the subject of long and tedious litigation. Airchains uses blockchain to develop unique NFTs that serve as land ownership proofs under NKDA’s jurisdiction. This system allows property registration certificates and land records to be digitally recorded and traced, eliminating tedious paperwork and promising to facilitate the lifetime tracking of ownership. Physical copies of NFTs are available in card format, while digital QR code certificates are used to ensure quick access after relevant authentication processes. Digitizing proof of land records in this way is also crucial to counteract ownership often made on the basis of customary claims. Airchains’ agenda is testament to the blockchain revolution to “steadily penetrat[e] and disrupt a plethora of traditional sectors.” Crucially, the project remains uninvolved with crypto transactions, choosing easier, gasless methods to interact with users. Airchains’ user base has soared by 150% in the past two quarters, alluding to a widespread consensus about replacing traditional bureaucracy with a transparent and secure digital system of land ownership. The team plans to introduce 500,000 NFTs deployed on Polygon Supernets to expand the land mutation process across 27,000 acres, as reported by Forbes. These examples illustrate why blockchain and crypto cannot be conflated — and why people shouldn’t be quick to point to market volatility as a reason to dismiss both. Once you distinguish a technology from its dominant applications, its uses quickly multiply. Blockchain is a new frontier in the world of finance, sure. But it is irresponsible and inaccurate to correlate an asset’s volatility to its legitimacy, especially as bitcoin’s price now exceeds $40,000 and promises to continue being influenced by market dynamics, investor sentiments and new regulation. The path to Web3 mass adoption will be long and tedious. But keeping crypto in the spotlight distracts from blockchain’s most disruptive use cases, most of which haven’t even been dreamt up yet. It is the responsibility of advocates to explore how we can co-opt this technology to transform the long-standing institutional idea of “that’s just how things have been done” because we got too complacent to challenge it.

91::https://blockworks.co/news/music-industry-blockchain-bandcamp::Blockworks::article::The music industry could learn a few lessons from blockchain::Opinion: Digital ownership is inevitable, but let’s be realistic about the problems it solves.::Bandcamp’s drama and community response has reminded us that the investments we make into centralized internet products are neither owned by us nor permanent Midjourney modified by Blockworks I spent twenty years building digital music applications and businesses, most recently Beats Music and Apple Music, previously with Yahoo!, Winamp, Topspin and Beastie Boys. Today, I work at Ledger and espouse the utility of crypto instead, so I’m often asked the question, “What about music on the blockchain?” “Meh,” is my standard response. I don’t see the innovation or consumer need in asking people to buy digital music NFTs like they bought CDs, or trying to shoehorn digital ownership into streaming services meant to compete with Spotify. Listening to music on the internet is a solved problem, and music listeners don’t need the help of a blockchain to hear what they want. Just say, “Hey Siri, play The Beatles,” to remind yourself just how far we’ve come since Napster. The business of music rights is an oligopoly controlled by three major labels and four digital music services, none of whom have an interest in open standards. But the two-sided marketplace of Bandcamp is a great place to consider the value blockchains can and will add to the artist/fan relationship, and how that change will come slowly over the next fifteen years. Below is a thought exercise using Bandcamp to demonstrate where digital ownership can meaningfully change the paradigm without asking consumers to change their habits all at once. For music fans — and in particular, fans of niche genres such as heavy metal and contemporary jazz — Bandcamp is beloved. The site launched in 2008 and bloomed slowly, building a passionate community of music lovers over fifteen years. The functionality of Bandcamp.com is simple: Stream for free, buy digital for around $10, and often buy vinyl (Bandcamp actually bought a pressing plant to help the creator side of their marketplace press vinyl), as well as t-shirts or other physical collectibles from the artist. Artists receive a net average of 82% of every sale, and Bandcamp has paid out around $1 billion to artists and labels selling on the site since its launch. But in March 2022, Bandcamp was sold to Epic Games. “Bandcamp will play an important role in Epic’s vision to build out a creator marketplace ecosystem,” Epic Games wrote in a statement. Bandcamp unionized in March 2023, and when Epic Games announced it was laying off 16% of its total workforce in September, a sale of Bandcamp to Songtradr was announced. Only 50% of the Bandcamp staff was retained and the community voiced its concern for the future of Bandcamp loudly culminating in this Pitchfork article: “Is Bandcamp as we know it over?”. Bandcamp’s drama and community response has reminded us — like MySpace, Flickr and so many other platforms before — that the investments we make into centralized internet products are neither owned by us nor permanent. At the end of the day, these are for-profit companies with investors looking for outcomes. Our investments into the platform are of value for them, not for us. The digital albums purchased, as well as the “relationship” between the artist and consumer, are owned by Bandcamp. If they disappear, so does the artist’s access to their fanbase and the listener’s backup of the music they’ve paid for. With decentralized ownership, this could be fundamentally different. If I were at the helm, here is how I would modify Bandcamp: The ambitions could be set higher than I suggest above — digital packaging and payouts to creative collaborators like Metalabel is building would be very useful in the Bandcamp context. Read more from our opinion section: You aren’t thinking hard enough about digital art You could also imagine artists earning ownership in Bandcamp based on performance and a revenue stream for artists where the profits of the platform are paid out based on this ownership (what Visa was for banks, Bandcamp could be for artists). But I like the simple thought experience described in the bullet points above particularly because the changes are subtle and simple, yet meaningful to both artists and fans, without asking either to change their behavior overnight. But we should keep this in perspective — the entire recorded music industry made $26 billion in revenue in 2022, whereas Bandcamp has paid out just $1 billion to artists since 2008. Also, the examples above speak to how application developers in categories beyond music will integrate digital ownership slowly and optionally for their customers, rather than a Web3 “big bang” overnight. Digital ownership is inevitable, but let’s be realistic about the problems it solves and how quickly this new paradigm is arriving to mainstream consumers.

92::https://blockworks.co/news/algorand-fork-voi-blockchain::Blockworks::article::Algorand fork Voi tries a blockchain reboot::The self-declared “community-powered blockchain” testing a new network based on Algrorand tech.::Exclusive: The self-declared “community-powered blockchain” testing a new network based on Algrorand tech Maurice NORBERT/Shutterstock, modified by Blockworks Veteran members of the Algorand proof-of-stake blockchain ecosystem have banded together to launch a new iteration of the open-source code, called Voi, which is currently in testnet. Leading the new project is Chris Swenor, co-founder of both Reach, a blockchain development platform and the Algorand decentralized exchange (DEX) HumbleSwap. Work on Voi began in 2022, with a premise that the blockchain should better align incentives with its community of developers and users, and motivated by Swenor’s frustration with perceived shortcomings within the crypto industry. “I looked around and I was so frustrated that I saw that [venture capitalists] and the early builders owned over 90% of all tokens, and the people that are actually still there during the bear market really didn’t own the chain, but they’re still there pouring their heart into it,” Swenor told Blockworks. Voi is only forking the Algorand code, but not the chain’s state. So, unlike the failed EthPoW fork of Ethereum, for instance, Voi will have its own crypto token, but one with no connection to ownership of ALGO. In software development, a repository fork is essentially a copy of a repository that allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. That’s what’s happening here, in contrast to an Algorand blockchain fork, which is not possible. Algorand has struggled to attract users in recent years. Its seven-day dex volume, for example, is currently less than $10 million, according to DeFi Llama, placing it 38th by that metric. Read more: Closure of largest DeFi destination underscores Algorand’s struggles Swenor’s critique is not specifically of Algorand or its development stewards Algorand Technologies and the Algorand Foundation, with which he said he maintains good relations. Blockworks reached out to both Algorand entities to learn more. As a long time developer within the Algorand tech stack, Swenor said it was natural to remain focused on the Algorand consensus engine. “The thing that was very clear is that the Algorand tech is literally the best tech that we’ve ever worked with, as far as speed and what it can deliver,” he said. One of the chief differences is that Voi’s developers have earmarked 75% of its entire market cap for “ecosystem growth.” That includes node runners, and the testnet has attracted nearly 500 nodes according to its explorer, though it’s not apparent how many of those are independently operated. “This means that a very small percentage of the overall network [token] is earmarked for operations and the core team,” Swenor said. Voi intends to concentrate on a smaller vertical of applications as part of its go-to-market strategy, emphasizing “membership infrastructure,” in contrast to Algorand’s institutional focus. But Swenor also expects to contribute to Algorand development by bringing in developers, and improving tooling such as wallet and node software. The new network counts original Algorand investor Arrington Capital among its seed investors along with Sonic Boom Ventures, founded by former Algorand, Inc. CEO Steven Kokinos, who sees it as complementary to Algorand. “I think what is exciting about Voi in particular is that they’ve done a lot of work to be able to connect Voi back to the Algorand mainnet and be able to exchange assets using tech like state proofs that was built into Algorand for that express purpose,” Kokinos told Blockworks. The remaining Algorand team was initially skeptical of Voi, Swenor said, but that changed over time. They’re seeing now that this is actually beneficial for Algorand as a whole…because we’re kind of at different missions and we’re going after different things, I don’t see them seeing it as a threat by any means,” he said.

One of the key benefits for those new to trading is the provision of a demo account, enabling them to familiarize themselves with the interface and hone their trading strategies without jeopardizing their funds. If you don’t have a Binance account. You can register here The trading simulator, also known as a demo account, on this cryptocurrency exchange, serves as a risk-free virtual account aimed at educating users and helping them develop their trading skills. It offers beginners a safe environment to navigate through the platform’s features, experiment with different strategies, and refine their trading abilities. Binance provides access to this simulator specifically for futures trading through the Binance Testnet. The emphasis on derivatives rather than spot trading stems from the heightened risks associated with futures trading. Furthermore, navigating through the Futures section on Binance can be complex, increasing the likelihood of beginners making inadvertent errors while initiating positions. Given the similarities between futures and spot orders, utilizing the trading simulator for Futures enables Binance users to also grasp the fundamentals of the interface used across various trading modalities. Therefore, it is recommended for novices to commence their journey in cryptocurrency trading and get acquainted with the exchange starting with a demo account. A test trading demo account is indispensable for individuals new to the world of trading. When used effectively, it can significantly minimize the risks of deposit losses due to a lack of experience and technical blunders. Nevertheless, similar to any instrument, a trading simulator has its set of pros and cons. However, it’s critical not to treat the demo account as a perfect substitute for a real trading terminal. It has several downsides that hinder the replication of an authentic trading experience with a real deposit: In sum, while the Binance Testnet trading simulator is a valuable resource for educational purposes, it lacks the capacity to completely mirror the intricacies and conditions of real trading, and it does not impose the emotional burdens—such as stress and pressure—that traders face when putting their own money on the line. The experience is incomparable to trading on a simulator. If your goal is to comprehensively understand the trading interface of the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, your best option is to utilize a demo account on the Binance Testnet. It’s accessible in the futures trading section, allowing you to experiment with Binance futures trading without putting your deposit at risk. However, it is imperative to recognize that the trading simulator is not a full substitute for a real trading terminal. A demo account can’t precisely mimic unpredictable market conditions and does not provide the trader with the level of involvement and emotional experience that comes with trading real money.

The […]::Former CTO and current CEO of Tether, Paolo Ardoino, recently spotlighted the substantial profits of the foremost stablecoin project and stressed the worldwide adoption of USDT as protection against inflation. In conversation with the Wolf of All Streets Podcast, Ardoino shared that despite market instability, Tether’s (USDT) circulation has expanded over the last year. The organization backs its currency with its own assets and capital, stemming from investments in US treasuries and short-term holdings managed with due diligence. He disclosed that Tether retains a considerable sum of $72.6 billion in US treasury bills. Ardoino underlined Tether’s commitment to upholding a stablecoin pegged at parity with the US dollar. In the final quarter of 2022, Tether realized a profit of $700 million. Despite close scrutiny from the public eye, Tether has navigated through various crises and major bankruptcies within the web3 domain, cooperating actively with law enforcement, including the Department of Justice, according to Ardoino. He reaffirmed the company’s dedication to offering a stablecoin that mirrors the US dollar one-to-one, without any current intentions for an initial public offering. Ardoino pointed out that over the preceding year, Tether’s USDT saw a rise in distribution, countering the volatility experienced by other digital currencies and stablecoins. Even in a bearish market, USDT’s market capitalization remains over $85 billion, ranking it the third-largest cryptocurrency globally. The recent financial success has prompted Tether to contemplate diversification strategies. The company is also aspiring to evolve into an all-encompassing tech provider, which requires expertise in key sectors such as energy, communication, and financial infrastructure, as he disclosed. Amid the recent buzz around stablecoins in the crypto sphere, Brian Brooks of Valor Capital Group, formerly Acting Comptroller of the Currency and CEO of Binance U.S., noted that stablecoins could reestablish the significance of the U.S. dollar in emerging markets. On the legislative front, July 27 marked a stride forward as the U.S. House Financial Services Committee progressed a bill to set up a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins, typically pegged to traditional assets like the U.S. dollar. This proposed law delegates to the Federal Reserve the task of stipulating stablecoin issuance conditions, while preserving state regulatory authorities’ powers. The bill underwent revisions earlier to alleviate concerns from some democrats about stablecoin issuers potentially skirting stringent regulations by operating under state jurisdictions. Meanwhile, the conviction of ex-crypto mogul Sam Bankman-Fried, implicated in misappropriating over $10 billion from clients and investors, underscores yet another disturbing episode in the crypto industry. Despite such incidents, there seems to be little momentum towards enacting clear regulatory standards. Last year, amidst significant downturns in cryptocurrencies and a wave of bankruptcies, U.S. Congress looked into regulating the sector. However, these efforts have moved slowly, especially given the current year’s challenges like global tensions, inflation, and the looming 2024 election. President Biden issued an executive order on cryptocurrency oversight, directing the Fed to explore the possibility of establishing a digital currency. source::2023-11-06T02:00:00::blockchain, cryptocurrency, cryptomarket, cryptonewstoday, news, regulations, Tether::Thomas Daniels::Cryptocurrency News::https://coinatory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Tether4_CN1.png

Currently more than 40% of the operations carried out in the main world stock exchanges are operated by automatic robots (according to the digital newspaper lainformacion.com). The cryptocurrency ecosystem was until recently an unexplored terrain for this type of operations, where the most that could be done was to automate some orders on the exchanges. That’s why DeepTradeBot has developed a series of complex AI and big data tools that will allow us to explore a whole new world of possibilities with little risk. Please Note: This is a Press Release DeepTradeBot is a collection of automated trading tools developed by Deep Neuro Networks LTD, a London, England-based company dedicated to artificial intelligence and cloud computing. Here we find the first advantage, we are dealing with a legal company, registered in a safe country within Europe. They have a contact telephone number (attended in English). The investment is based on analyzing a large amount of data, designing a strategy, and then carrying out the actions that follow that strategy. This is something very easy to say, but very difficult to do. First of all, we humans find ourselves with our limited capacity to process data (as an example, the main artificial intelligences have defeated the human being in disciplines of pure analysis such as chess). Secondly, human beings make mistakes derived from our emotions, which often lead us away from the method or make us perceive the data analyzed in the wrong way. To these factors we must add fatigue, mistakes, and a long etcetera. Therefore, trading robots are a perfect tool to help us achieve higher returns for our investment. DeepTradeBot will operate on major cryptocurrency exchanges in 24/7 format. To take full advantage of all the opportunities of AI, 4 types of robot actions are managed according to the market situation: Earning by investing in DeepTradeBot is very simple. Its platform is designed to facilitate the entire process so that all we have to do is register, select the type of investment and the number of bots we want to put to work for us. And artificial intelligence will do the rest. In the following table we can see the options available right now on the platform. Neurons are the unit that has been created to simplify the measurement of computing power to which we have access. It is obtained from relevant parameters such as the dedicated computing time, the number of layers of the dedicated neural network and the amount of connection resources dedicated to reading and sending the information. It is very interesting to note that we have a free version that will allow us to test the platform, although of course it will be much less powerful than the other options. More information and full contract conditions are available on its website.

With […]::Bitcoin Press Release: Flyp.me has announced a new app for Android users providing easy access to the world’s pioneering accountless cryptocurrency exchange with support for over 30 cryptocurrencies. April 8, 2020. Accountless cryptocurrency exchange Flyp.me is launching an all-new cryptocurrency exchange platform for Android users that doesn’t require an account to exchange your crypto. With the help of this platform, crypto users and traders can easily “flyp” cryptocurrencies in a borderless way securely. The exchange offers a unique experience that will help the crypto industry grow and increase its accountless capacity. The Flyp.me platform is a unique option available in the crypto world as it doesn’t require users to make an account before exchanging/trading cryptocurrencies. The service has been available for crypto users since 2017 and has now been made available on Android phones. Due to this approach, many useful key features of cryptocurrencies are preserved and the control is handed back to the user. Flyp.me allows users complete control over their private keys. This is an extremely important functionality extended to the user. The private keys allow the users complete control over their cryptocurrency holdings and diminishes the power of the exchange in the spirit of the decentralization philosophy. Conventional cryptocurrency exchanges are popular right now but they are also receiving criticism for their continuing demise of the rights and functionalities of cryptocurrencies. By giving users control of their private keys, Flyp.me helps protect users’ rights while providing the functionality needed. Key features of the new accountless crypto exchange include: • Support for over 30 cryptocurrencies. • 24-hour availability for users around the world. • Fast transactions and the ability to flip between different popular cryptocurrencies supported in the platform. • Private operations as the exchange don’t require an account to start trading. • Safe operations as the operations are end-to-end supported by state-of-the-art security protocols and measures. • Open API integration for other websites and crypto services platforms. This allows other platforms to have a useful symbiotic relationship with the Flyp.me exchange. Flyp.me allows businesses and users to accept or send cryptocurrency with ease, anytime, anywhere. Head to Google Play) to download the app. Flyp.me is the professional tool for instant crypto trading developed by the team at HolyTransaction, the first multicurrency web wallet since 2014. There is no registration necessary and no hidden analytics tracking you. Moreover, Flyp.me does not control users’ funds, so your private keys are not at risk of being held on third-party services.

98::https://coinatory.com/cryptocurrency-articles/are-crypto-airdrops-to-make-money-11993/::Coinatory::article::Are Crypto Airdrops a Good Opportunity to Make Money in 2024?::Think of a crypto airdrops as a free giveaway, where new digital coins or tokens are handed out to people who already own some cryptocurrency::Think of a crypto airdrops as a free giveaway, where new digital coins or tokens are handed out to people who already own some cryptocurrency or those who do a few tasks. Blockchain startups use this tactic a lot, kind of like a promo, to get the word out about their new projects. Moreover, digital assets can have multiple use cases. Over different time spans, they can grant users decision-making powers within a network or give them VIP access to content via NFTs. What’s cool about these assets? They can be swapped or sold super easily. That’s because they’re highly liquid. So, if you get assets through an airdrop, you could trade them for other cryptocurrencies or even cash them out into your local currency. There’s a variety of airdrops out there, but a common thread is that you typically need to register in some way to get those free digital goodies sent to the right wallet address. For some airdrops, you might need to do a task or two. Regardless of the requirements, the end game is pretty much the same: make sure your wallet address gets noted down before the deadline. When a startup sets its sights on an airdrop, the kickoff is usually a public campaign. To get the word out, they often take to places like forums and social media like Discord and Twitter. Create a buzz around a new platform launch or a fresh feature, and of course, the juicy airdrop reward. As the hype builds, the next move for these companies is to make a list of who’s getting the tokens. This isn’t one-size-fits-all; they might gather wallet addresses from those who show interest, or they might take a ‘snapshot’ at a specific moment. This snapshot helps them see who’s eligible based on certain criteria. For instance, if they want to reward those who were using their platform before September, they’ll take a snapshot of all the active wallet addresses from that period. Related: Discover how to create NFT in just 6 easiest steps! Absolutely, from a user’s point of view, airdrops can be like hitting the jackpot without buying a ticket. First off, it’s kind of like getting dividends on stocks. If the crypto airdrop project takes off, those airdropped tokens that appeared magically in your wallet might appreciate in value. So, by just sitting tight and holding onto them, you could see a tidy sum down the road. Then there’s the extra layer of perks some airdropped tokens bring to the table. Imagine being handed a membership card to an exclusive club. On some platforms, these tokens don’t just sit idly; they give you voting rights, especially if they double as governance tokens. So you get to have a say in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) decisions related to the platform. And it doesn’t stop there. Think of these airdrop tokens as seed money that you can invest to grow more digital crops. Advanced crypto farming techniques like yield farming or lending can help users expand their portfolios, turning those “free” tokens into interest-earning assets. All in all, airdrops are more than just freebies; they’re opportunities. And who doesn’t love a good opportunity, right? When you think about crypto airdrops, there’s a bunch to mull over. First off, you’ve got to be cautious about the safety of your network. When you’re trying to get these airdrops, some dodgy ones might ask you to link your wallet to some sketchy websites. Once you’ve done that, you’re potentially giving a thief an all-access pass to your account info. Then there’s the fact that not all airdrops crypto are the real deal. I mean, who doesn’t like free money, right? But some of these projects are just baiting folks to buy more tokens to up the value of their airdrop crypto. What’s the catch? Well, they could just flood the market with a ton of these tokens all at once, causing the price to plummet and making the airdrops you got earlier pretty much worthless. Some folks might also see airdrops as kinda low-tier. Instead of giving out free tokens willy-nilly, maybe it’d be better to reward the people actually doing the hard work, like the miners or others putting in the effort on a project. Oh, and here’s a kicker: even if you do get an airdrop, you might not be able to do much with it. Sometimes these airdrops say they’re worth a boatload of money, but if you can’t trade ’em because there’s no demand, then they’re pretty much just fancy, worthless digital trinkets.

On Aug. 18, Binance conveyed that they are contemplating legal measures against Checkout.com, their former payment collaborator. The root of the potential legal conflict lies in communications made by Checkout.com to Binance on Aug. 9 and Aug. 11. As per Forbes, Guillaume Pousaz, the head of Checkout.com, concluded their partnership with Binance, pointing to regulatory actions and concerns over compliance, Anti-Money Laundering, and sanctions. A Binance representative stated, “We don’t concur with Checkout’s reasons for ending the partnership, and we’re reviewing potential legal avenues.” They emphasized that transaction services continue to be accessible on their platform. Yet, this termination led Binance to halt Binance Connect, a regulated crypto transaction service, on Aug. 16. Initiated in March 2022, this service functioned as a bridge between traditional finance and crypto enterprises, supporting numerous fiat and crypto transactions. Forbes indicated that Binance was once Checkout.com’s prime client, overseeing around $2 billion in monthly transactions in 2021. Recently, Binance has faced challenges in banking collaborations, causing difficulties for its worldwide outlets. In June, its European banking ally, Paysafe Payment Solutions, ceased support. Meanwhile, in Australia, Binance was unexpectedly disconnected from the banking grid. In the U.S., Binance.US encountered challenges in securing banking allies, with past collaborators Silvergate and Signature Bank halting services earlier this year due to a banking upheaval. Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s chief, even pondered acquiring a bank in a recent conversation. Moreover, Binance’s legal and operational predicaments persist. On June 5, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit against both Binance and its chief, alleging securities law breaches and unlicensed securities offerings. source::2023-08-19T04:00:00::adoption, Binance, Checkout.com, cryptocurrency, cryptomarket, cryptonewstoday, news, regulations::Thomas Daniels::Business news::https://coinatory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Checkout_CN.png

Stone’ Pleads Guilty to Wire Fraud::TJ Stone has pleaded guilty to wire fraud, deceiving investors with promises of high returns through a non-existent crypto wallet. He faces up to 20 years in prison.::Thomas John Sfraga, widely known in cryptocurrency circles as “TJ Stone,” has pleaded guilty to wire fraud charges in a Brooklyn federal court on Thursday. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Sfraga misled investors with promises of up to 60% returns within three months through a non-existent cryptocurrency digital wallet. Instead of delivering on these promises, he allegedly diverted the funds for personal use and to appease previous victims of his fraudulent schemes. “For years, Sfraga brazenly lied to friends, neighbors, and investors to swindle over $1.3 million of their hard-earned life savings,” stated Breon Peace, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York. Throwback to ‘Seinfeld’ Sfraga also purported ownership of “Vandelay Contracting Corp.” and “Build Strong Homes LLC,” companies with names evocative of a fictional business from the television show “Seinfeld.” This fictitious reference was part of his ploy to attract investors into funding non-existent construction projects. An FBI investigation revealed that Sfraga’s fraudulent activities extended into cryptocurrency staking, a process where digital assets support a blockchain network, offering potential returns through yields. According to a December 2023 FBI complaint, Sfraga misrepresented the risks involved in cryptocurrency staking to potential investors, falsely claiming it was an “ironclad situation” with “no risk.” With a background in real estate development, media relations, podcasting, and hosting cryptocurrency events in New York, Sfraga now faces up to 20 years in prison. He has also been ordered to pay $1.33 million in restitution. source::2024-05-18T08:00:00::cryptocurrency, cryptomarket, cryptonewstoday, news, regulations, scam, scammer::Thomas Daniels::Cryptocurrency News::https://coinatory.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hacker2_CN.png

This consideration arises as the European Union prepares to implement a new regulatory framework for digital assets in July. The impending Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations, which have not yet been finalized by the European Banking Authority, are expected to impose stringent restrictions on stablecoins available to European investors. Kraken’s global head of regulatory strategy, Marcus Hughes, stated, “We’re absolutely planning for all eventualities, including situations where it’s just not tenable to list specific tokens such as USDT.” Tether’s Response Tether officials anticipate that exchanges will prioritize euro liquidity for EU clients while maintaining USDT as a provisional measure. Despite this, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino previously indicated that Tether does not intend to comply with MiCA regulations in the medium term. Earlier this year, in March, OKX, another major cryptocurrency exchange, suspended USDT trading for European Union users, a move likely influenced by the forthcoming MiCA regulations. Legal Framework and Compliance MiCA aims to provide a clear legal framework for crypto exchanges and companies offering cryptocurrency custody services, allowing them to operate legally within the EU. The law will also establish comprehensive rules for the operation of stablecoin issuers. After MiCA comes into effect, crypto companies will be required to obtain registration in one of the EU member states, granting them the ability to operate throughout the entire bloc. The provisions specifically targeting stablecoins are set to become effective as early as June 2024. source::2024-05-18T03:00:00::cryptocurrency, cryptomarket, cryptonewstoday, regulations, Tether, USDT::Thomas Daniels::Cryptocurrency News::https://coinatory.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Tether_1200_CN1-1.png

Eric Balchunas predicts sustained growth for spot Bitcoin ETFs, highlighting increased demand.::Spot Bitcoin ETFs have successfully reversed April’s outflows within the first two weeks of May. Eric Balchunas, Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg, highlighted that Bitcoin ETFs have already attracted $1.3 billion in inflows this month, effectively countering April’s negative outflows. This brings the total inflows to $12.3 billion since their inception. Balchunas emphasized that fluctuations in capital movements are a natural aspect of ETFs and should not concern investors. He remains confident that spot Bitcoin ETFs will deliver positive long-term returns. CryptoQuant reports that this resurgence in activity is coupled with renewed demand for Bitcoin. Both regular holders and large investors are increasing their Bitcoin holdings, indicating a heightened market interest. Recent data from SoSo Value confirms that spot Bitcoin ETFs have experienced a robust recovery from April’s downturn. On May 16, these funds reported $257.34 million in inflows. Leading the pack is BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which secured $94 million in inflows, boosting its assets under management to $18 billion, just shy of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC). On the same day, GBTC recorded a net daily inflow of $5 million, marking the third consecutive trading day it closed in positive territory since its transition from a trust to a spot ETF. source::2024-05-17T22:00:00::Bitcoin, ETF, Bitcoin, ETFs, Rebound, in, May, cryptocurrency, cryptomarket, cryptonewstoday, news, regulations::Thomas Daniels::Cryptocurrency News::https://coinatory.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Bitcoin-ETFs-Outshine-Gold1_CN1.png

More than 80 billion NOT tokens have been distributed, with a significant majority, exceeding 90%, delivered directly to participants engaged as “miners” on the platform. Notcoin, a pioneering play-to-earn clicker game that operates via the Telegram app, announced its recent airdrop through an official press release. The initiative saw the allocation of over 80.2 billion NOT tokens to community members active on The Open Network blockchain. According to the announcement, 90% of these tokens have been designated for “miners,” while the remaining 7.9 billion are accessible through the redemption of non-fungible token (NFT) vouchers. This development precedes Notcoin’s anticipated inclusion on various prominent centralized exchanges, including Binance, OKX, and Bybit. Eligible community members can claim their NOT tokens within the Notcoin app, with provisions for on-chain withdrawal concurrent with the token’s exchange listing, as detailed in the press release. Ryan Dennis, the Brand Director at TON Foundation, remarked on the game’s rapid ascent and cultural impact. “Notcoin has not only emerged as the fastest-growing and most popular game in blockchain history, but it has also become a cultural phenomenon, cultivating one of the largest and most engaged communities in the Web3 space,” he stated. Sasha Plotvinov, founder of Open Builders—a collective of blockchain developers centered around The Open Network—emphasized the ecosystem’s commitment to transparency and equitable distribution. He noted that these principles are vital for fostering realistic visions of mass crypto adoption. Launched in late 2023, Notcoin has innovatively leveraged The Open Network blockchain to offer a unique gaming experience. Players engage by “mining” NOT tokens through simple screen taps while operating the Notcoin mini-app on mobile devices. Following the game’s traction, the Notcoin team facilitated the conversion of in-game balances to NOT tokens at a ratio of 1000:1, thereby transforming every thousand in-game Notcoin into one NOT token. source::2024-05-16T17:00:00::cryptocurrency, cryptomarket, cryptonewstoday, news, Notcoin, regulations::Thomas Daniels::Cryptocurrency News::https://coinatory.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Notcoin_CN.png

This strategic initiative emerges at a time when digital security is under intense scrutiny, particularly concerning the handling of personal and biometric data. The newly introduced system is designed to enhance data security through the use of Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC), a method that protects data by dispersing it across multiple locations. Hosted on Github, this system exemplifies the Foundation’s commitment to transparency and community-driven development. As detailed in the Foundation’s blog, this advanced SMPC technology splits a single secret into several parts, distributing these amongst various stakeholders to fortify protection. This method is particularly crucial for safeguarding biometric data collected during user registration for the Worldcoin (WLD) project through Orb devices. These devices, pivotal in the registration process, perform iris scanning to verify identities and facilitate the distribution of WLD tokens. In a significant move towards enhanced data privacy, the Worldcoin Foundation has also transitioned to this new system, simultaneously erasing old iris codes that were accumulated previously. This step not only elevates the standard of data protection but also aligns with global best practices amidst growing regulatory scrutiny over data collection methods. The collaboration with TACEO and Tools for Humanity has been instrumental in overcoming the scalability and cost barriers associated with SMPC technology. Tools for Humanity, co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, has been at the forefront of developing this project, taking significant measures to alleviate concerns surrounding its data handling practices. This development is timely as demands for biometric verification are increasing across various sectors. With its new system, the Worldcoin Foundation is leading the way in setting higher standards for data security and addressing the critical needs of digital identity verification in today’s interconnected world. source::2024-05-16T06:00:00::blockchain, cryptocurrency, cryptomarket, cryptonewstoday, news, regulations, WLD, Worldcoin::Thomas Daniels::Cryptocurrency News::https://coinatory.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/worldcoin_logo_CN.png

This surge in capital allocation aligns closely with a key uptick in Bitcoin’s value, affirming investor confidence in the cryptocurrency sector. Farside Investors reports that overall, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs saw $100.5 million in net inflows on May 14, indicating a robust week of investment activity. Conversely, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) experienced a net outflow of $50.9 million, contrasting sharply with the inflows seen in other funds. Notably, the ARKB ETF has consistently attracted substantial capital, with inflows surpassing the $100 million mark seven times previously. The fund reached its peak with a record $200.7 million inflow on March 27, and its most considerable outflow of $98.1 million occurred shortly afterward on May 1. Other funds like BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) have not mirrored this trend, with no new inflows for two consecutive days. Meanwhile, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) added $8.1 million in net inflows, bolstered by a strong performance the previous day with $38.6 million, leading the U.S. BTC ETF market. Additional smaller-scale inflows were noted in ETFs such as BTCO, EZBC, BRRR, and HODL, which reported $5.5 million, $1.8 million, $1.2 million, and $1.7 million respectively. The cumulative net inflows into the BTC ETF market are nearing a milestone, approaching $12 billion, currently standing at $11.84 billion. This growth trajectory coincides with Bitcoin’s recent price increase, which saw a 0.5% rise over the past 24 hours, with the cryptocurrency trading at $62,150. This data not only highlights the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency investment landscape but also signals a continued investor interest amid fluctuating market conditions. source::2024-05-15T15:00:00::ARK, ARK, Invest, bitcoin, Bitcoin, ETF, blockchain, cryptocurrency, cryptomarket, cryptonewstoday, ETF, news, regulations::Thomas Daniels::Cryptocurrency News::https://coinatory.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SECs-ETF_CN.png
