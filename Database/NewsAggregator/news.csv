On the 19th of May, AMBCrypto observed that Ethereum’s [ETH] average transaction size had fallen to $2,767. This was a 54.13% decline from the metric when the month began. At that time, the average transaction size was $5,893, according to data from IntoTheBlock. For the uninitiated, the average transaction size checks in dollar terms the mean transaction value for an asset on a particular day.  Historically, spikes in this metric signal high user activity—Especially from large investors and institutions. But when it decreases, it implies an absence of institutional interaction. As such, the recent state of Ethereum implies a presence of more retail users. Apart from that, this indicator identifies potential tops and bottoms. From the value mentioned, it was obvious that ETH seemed closer to its bottom than the top. At press time, ETH’s price was $3,106, indicating that it had swung around the same range in the last 24 hours. Source: IntoTheBlock Going by the analysis above, the price of the cryptocurrency could be set to hit a higher value in the short term. However, other metrics need to be considered. As a result of this, AMBCrypto looked at the Ethereum Exchange Net Position Change. According to data obtained from Glassnode, the Exchange Net Position Change has been in the negative region for most of the last 30 days. This metric tracks the 30-day change of the supply held in exchange wallets. A positive value indicates that more coins are in exchanges. On the other hand, a negative value indicates increased withdrawals from exchanges. One thing we noticed was that the metric suddenly became positive on the 18th of May. As of this writing, the ETH net position change was 81,715. This increase could be a sign that Ethereum participants are taking profits off the 6.50% increase within the last week. If this number continues to increase, then ETH’s price might decrease below $3,000 before the potential rally happens. Source: Santiment However, if exchange withdrawals intensify once more, the price might begin a slow increase toward $3,500. In a highly bullish situation, an increase to $4,000 could be an option. On Friday, the 17th of May, AMBCrypto reported how options traders were expecting ETH’s price to hit $3,600 between May and the end of June. At press time, Glassnode data showed that the sentiment had not changed. This is because of the signals from the Put/Call Ratio (PCR). Is your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator If the PCR is over 0.70, it implies a bearish sentiment and there are more puts than calls. However, a reading below 0.50 implies otherwise. At press time, Ethereum’s Put/Call Ratio was 0.35, meaning that most traders expect the value of the cryptocurrency to increase in the coming weeks.

If any of these key institutions were to go bankrupt, they would likely take sizable market chunks down with them. This guide explores some of the most impactful crypto bankruptcies, which have changed how the industry considers compliance, security standards, risk management, and the associated economic consequences. Over the years, numerous failed crypto projects have led to eventual crypto bankruptcies. While we shall discuss a number of these in detail, here’s a quick summary of some of the key events. In 2014, the Mt.Gox bankruptcy was led by a host of security breaches and resulted in a loss of 850,000 BTC. Then, there was the QuadrigaCX bankruptcy, which resulted in sizable investor losses due to financial mismanagement and lack of proper risk management strategies. Perhaps the most well-known crypto bankruptcy, however, was the FTX collapse in late 2022, led by the now-convicted Sam Bankman Fried. Companies in #crypto that have gone bankrupt Three Arrows Capital Celsius Network Terraform Labs Voyager Digital Core Scientific Babel Finance Hodlnaut Genesis BlockFI Zipmex FTX Blockchain Global And these are only a handful of failed crypto projects. Read on as we thoroughly explore the notable crypto bankruptcies, with the most recent events explained first. Did you know? Investigative sleuthers and handles like CoffeeZilla can help you track the status of both new and established crypto projects. This can help you navigate the space better and stay informed about possible scams, rug pulls, and other crypto bankruptcies. Genesis Global, a popular crypto trading and lending firm, imploded due to the severe liquidity crisis. Let us delve deeper into the aspects that impacted the positioning of this Digital Currency Group subsidiary. Genesis Global was overexposed to several less-than-transparent firms, including FTX and Three Arrows Capital. So when those institutions imploded, the entire machinery of Genesis Global felt the ripple effect. Genesis Global even kickstarted the Barry Silbert-led DCG group’s downfall as the extensive lending operations backfired. Here’s how on-chain metrics could have saved investors: Before Genesis Global filed for bankruptcy protection, the Genesis Trading OTC address transferred: – 50,000 $ETH($77.6M) #Coinbase; – 20,000 $ETH($31M) to #Bitstamp; – 5,000 $ETH($7.76M) and 3.9M $USDT to #Kraken; – 7.7M $FTM ($2.35M) to #Binance; – 36M $USDC to new address. pic.twitter.com/cMMKpLdVJs Eventually, the company filed for Chapter 11 (bankruptcy protection), listing liabilities to the tune of $11 billion. Over 100,000 creditors, per the company details, were impacted. The bankruptcy proceedings are ongoing, and a number of investors are still waiting to receive any compensation. In terms of recovery plans and asset sales, Genesis intends to sell shares to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and other establishments to raise approximately $1.6 billion. The FTX crisis was the primary bear market event, where most cryptocurrencies bottomed out. As we know, Solana (SOL) was one of the majorly impacted cryptocurrencies. Uncle Sam Bankman Fried. FTX balance sheet is like US bank balance sheets. Assets valued on what they were bought for, not what they can be sold for. “FTX is fine” is like the assurance that “the US financial system is resilient”. We don’t hear this except when it’s not fine. https://t.co/FRXHwSv8QJ pic.twitter.com/kEKAw6j08v FTX was one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. However, in November 2022, a series of investigative insights highlighted that this firm was working too closely with sister firm Alameda Research, also founded by Bankman-Fried. Customer deposits on FTX were being misused to cover Alameda’s losses. As the news broke, FTX experienced a bank run with many users trying to withdraw funds at the same time. As the exchange couldn’t meet the massive bankruptcy requests, it was forced to file for bankruptcy on Nov. 11, 2022. FTX and the concerned affiliates reported having assets and liabilities in the $10 billion to $50 billion range. Following the meltdown, a new CEO, John Jay Ray III, was appointed to navigate and oversee the restructuring process. Andrew Dietderich, an FTX Lawyer, stated in January 2024 that FTX creditors and customers will be paid in full. This process is still in the works. At present, the now-defunct organization plans to distribute $9 billion to cover some compensation claims. BlockFi, a leading crypto lending firm, was impacted by the financial distress experienced by FTX. It is known that BlockFi extended a $400 million credit line to FTX in addition to several direct investments. Crypto failures are interconnected: A judge is still yet to sign off on a settlement that will see BlockFi receive $874.5 million in claims against FTX and Alameda Research, while FTX will drop its claims against BlockFi. https://t.co/YQiIhqzd5V When FTX experienced a liquidity crisis, the perils of financial mismanagement rubbed onto BlockFi. The company had exposure to FTX and Alameda Research, which ensured that most of the assets were unrecoverable after the FTX collapse. While filing for bankruptcy, BlockFi reported assets and liabilities in the $1 billion to $10 billion range. These included $355 million worth of locked cryptocurrency on FTX and a defaulted loan worth $671 million to Alameda. The recovery efforts associated with BlockFi are ongoing. There has been a judicial decision concerning a repayment of $300 million to the creditors. Recovery percentages vary anywhere between 39% and 100%. This Singapore-based crypto hedge fund shut shop in June 2022. Here is what went down and how the market was impacted. The fund had heavy exposure to volatile crypto strategies and assets. Plus, there was significant leverage involved. Also, when the TerraUSD debacle led to LUNA’s death spiral and a major correction across multiple cryptocurrencies, the liquidity crisis for 3AC became harder to manage. The fund couldn’t meet margin calls associated with its leveraged positions and went bankrupt. OPNX, the crypto exchange and claims trading platform set up by the founders of Three Arrows Capital, will cease operations and shut down this month. @tikta_ reportshttps://t.co/QUAqcw6mpk 3AC filed for Chapter 15, securing assets from U.S. creditors amid liquidations. The total creditor claims reached as high as $3.5 billion, whereas the estimated assets, as of July 2023, stood at $1 billion. While the bankruptcy proceedings are ongoing, it is believed that 46% of the credit claims could be responded to. Celcius was a leading firm in the staking and lending space. The company declared bankruptcy in July 2022. The collapse of the Terra-Luna ecosystem was one of the major reasons that Celsius was forced to file for Chapter 11. The company was over-leveraged, made a series of poor investment decisions, and was pushed to the brink by a rapid withdrawal of funds by nervous investors. The recovery efforts seem to have concluded, and in January 2024, the company distributed assets worth $3 billion to creditors. Plus, the company has also revealed its plans to establish a Bitcoin mining entity to generate compensatory revenue further. So I finally got my distribution yesterday in the @CelsiusNetwork #Bankruptcy case. What's crazy (aside from how long it took & still no word on the shares) is that I'm getting some seriously convincing #phishing emails. The phishing emails are ones that are specifically related… pic.twitter.com/1OJfpEqGAH Voyager, a brokerage and lending firm, entered bankruptcy proceedings in July 2022. Voyager’s implosion followed the TerraUSD crash. As 3AC went down, it defaulted on a large credit line extended to 3AC, which caused unrest and negatively impacted Voyager’s health. At the time of filing — July 2022— Voyager reported liabilities worth $5.7 billion. Voyager initially planned to sell its assets to FTX U.S. for $1.4 billion, a move that would have helped creditors recover almost 72% of the claims. However, before this could happen, FTX collapsed, too, leaving the deal to fall through. As of 2024, the company has managed to return funds worth $270 million to the clients, and it even entered a deal worth $1 billion with Binance U.S. 1/ As soon as the news that #BinanceUS was preparing to bid for the bankrupt lending platform Voyager Digital came out, the price of $VGX rose from $0.288 to $0.442, an increase of 53.5%.https://t.co/6VLPn2t9zH pic.twitter.com/fBG33te8rP This means Voyager customers could potentially expect 35.72% of their claims to get addressed. The collapse of the Terra ecosystem didn’t only impact the U.S-based firms. The ripples were felt globally. Hodlnaut, a Singapore-specific lending platform, was also forced to shut shop following these events. The company faced severe liquidity issues and halted swaps, withdrawals, and even deposits in August 2022. It had allowed users to borrow against crypto deposits, a use-case that eventually made it vulnerable. When the market began correcting, the value of Hodlnaut’s collateral started dipping, leading to a massive liquidity shortfall. The company is going through a restructuring phase led by judicial inputs. This Southeast Asia-based cryptocurrency exchange catered to Thailand, Indonesia, Australia, and Singapore before going bust in 2022. The financial distress surrounding Zipmex amplified when two of its biggest borrowers, Celsius Network and Babel Finance, started facing a liquidity crisis. The loans were defaulted, exposing Zipmex’s erroneous financial stance. Marcus Lim, CEO and co-founder of Zipmex, denied that the firm was facing insolvency issues just days prior. https://t.co/fr2eI2Wc8X The company is still involved in a restructuring process presided over by the Singapore court. During the bankruptcy filing, Babel Finance and Celsius owed $48 million and $5 million to Zipmex, respectively. It isn’t only about lending firms or exchanges impacted by bankruptcies. Core Scientific, one of the largest Bitcoin miners in North America, filed for Chapter 11 in December 2022. An extended bear market followed by rising energy costs, increased mining difficulty, and piled-up debts were some of the reasons that Core Scientific had to shut shop. As of 2024, Core Scientific has emerged from the bankruptcy hit, mining 19,274 BTC in 2023 alone. Its post-bankruptcy reorganization process is complete, and it is also currently trading on NASDAQ (as of April 23, 2024) at close to $3 per share. Today @Core_Scientific have released their production for the last 24 hours and it appears they have taken full advantage of the transaction fees spike since the halving, producing a total of 57.3 #BTC equating to $3.72 million in revenues. 🚀 Hashprice revenues increased from… pic.twitter.com/XMA5xF5DDI Even mining firms need to diversify business operations and revenue streams to mitigate the threats of market volatility. It is worth noting that most of the crypto bankruptcies in 2022 were interconnected, exposing the over-reliance of key players on major liquidity providers and creditors. Even though 2022 and even 2023 saw the most impactful cryptocurrency bankruptcies, such events really started back in 2014 with the Mt.Gox bankruptcy. Since then, several crypto bankruptcies have surfaced, every now and then, led by security breaches, financial mismanagement, exit scams, and others. Here’s some insight into some other key events. This Australian crypto firm declared voluntary administration or bankruptcy in November 2021, led by a culminating debt that exceeded $15 million. Plus, one of its subsidiaries, the Australian Crypto Exchange or ACX, also halted its operations at that time, putting additional pressure on Blockchain Global. ACX, an Australian crypto exchange, declared bankruptcy in February 2020. The company ceased its exchange abruptly. Investor losses worth $10 million were recorded, which in turn forced the Victoria Supreme Court to issue a freeze order on ACX’s BTC holdings. This Singapore-based exchange declared bankruptcy in February 2020. Its controversial transaction mining business model fueled concerns of unsustainable cash flows. Accusations involving financial mismanagement and concerns related to exit scams and related frauds sealed the deal. This U.S-based crypto lending platform filed for Chapter 11 in 2020, driven by fraudulent activities, mismanagement, and poor investment choices. Cred gave out high-interest loans to moKredit and other third-party entities, expecting high profits — a move that backfired. Plus, a fraudulent asset manager was accused of misappropriating 800 Bitcoins via an entity called Quanticon. https://t.co/Xq2VseEfV5 Cred had a license to print money, and a blockchain ecosystem to do it on – and now they are filing Chapter 11 Bankruptcy driven by terrible risk controls. Looks like they over leveraged internal positions and had external loans go sour. Did you know? James Alexander was named as the fraudulent asset manager who was implicated in the 800-BTC fund misappropriation fiasco. This New Zealand-specific exchange was breached in 2019, with hackers managing access to the user wallets. The hack led to huge financial losses and forced Cryptopia to shut down operations and liquidate. QuadrigaCX was one of the largest Candian exchanges, which went bust after the unexpected death of Gerald Cotten, its CEO. Cotten, supposedly, was the only person with access to the firm’s cold wallets, and his death ensured a loss of almost $190 million in customer funds. Some folks still consider it one of the better-devised exit scams. 🚨LATEST: Canadian Province Asks QuadrigaCX Co-Founder to Explain His Wealth in New Order The Bitconnect bankruptcy or shutdown was essentially a disguised Ponzi scheme. The platform was aggressive in offering a 40% return to users, primarily by reinvesting user funds. However, the regulatory crackdown stunted its operations, leading to investor losses to the tune of $1 billion. Mt.Gox was once the largest Bitcoin exchange. In 2014, it experienced a massive security breach worth 850,000 BTC, led by poor management, technological flaws, and security lapses. Investors indulged in extended legal battles until 2021, when the rehabilitation plan for the distribution of assets was approved. MtGox Creditors Receive Update on Token Withdrawal 🚨🚨#MtGox has updated the official website form, providing details on expected tokens and payment statuses for creditors. The distribution of 142,000 #BTC, 143,000 BCH, and 69 billion yen is anticipated by October 31, 2024. Besides the mentioned cryptocurrency bankruptcies, there were a handful of other scams that impacted the associated companies beyond measure. Here are the notable ones: In 2016, Bitfinex, one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges, was hacked. Almost 120,000 Bitcoins were compromised, accounting for a massive loss figure of up to $72 million at the time. Even though they managed to avoid bankruptcy, a controversial strategy of introducing BFX tokens to make customers whole was introduced. It is worth noting that platforms launching tokens just for the sake of covering losses or raising capital isn’t a good practice. It can also be a major scam-specific red flag. The DAO, a venture capital body backing Ethereum, faced a smart contract hack in 2016. Almost $50 million worth of funds were compromised, which didn’t lead to bankruptcy but caused a split across the Ethereum community — a fork separating Ethereum Classic and Ethereum. This anomaly in 2017 started as a multi-sign vulnerability specific to the Parity wallet. However, it quickly escalated into a $280 million ETH freeze. This issue highlighted the risks associated with smart contract bugs. 2017 Parity wallet hacker begins moving $ETH into @TornadoCash#PeckShieldAlert ~990 $ETH into @TornadoCash from Parity Multisig Wallet Exploiters. pic.twitter.com/VESvN0XL9F This Japan-based exchange suffered a huge security breach in January 2018. Hackers stole NEM or XEM tokens worth $534 million from the exchange’s hot wallet, resulting in reputational and financial damage. The company eventually compensated investors using its own capital. Babel Finance had to go through a restructuring process in 2022 as it faced liquidity issues and had to halt withdrawals. Customer funds worth $280 million were compromised, citing that Babel sought bankruptcy protection in 2022. However, the court granted them an extension and time to restabilize and restructure. While everything looks well with Binance operationally, the largest crypto exchange has faced its share of issues. The CEX was ordered to pay $4.3 billion as part of a settlement with the Department of Justice. Plus, it continues to be at the center of endless regulatory scrutiny. While the exchange has been limited in a number of locations across the globe, the CEX has ramped up compliance efforts to the extent that it will resume operations in India in 2024. Good news for Crypto India! 🇮🇳#Binance is coming back to India, paying a $2 million penalty, and seeking compliance with PMLA! pic.twitter.com/iivm4oySP4 While investors do not have any control over crypto bankruptcies, there are a number of precautions that can be taken. Ensure to invest time in due diligence, opt for portfolio diversification, rely on cold wallets, and only interact with regulated platforms. As always, never invest more than you can comfortably afford to lose. The FTX collapse was one of the largest cryptocurrency bankruptcies. It happened due to misuse of customer funds and financial mismanagement. FTX used billion of dollars to cover losses at Alameda Research, leading to a liquidity crisis and eventually pushing the firm to the brink of bankruptcy proceedings. While there is no concrete list, many crypto companies have failed over the years, led by regulatory challenges, security breachesm, market volatility, and the team members pulling exit scams. The notable ones include the QuadrigaCX bankruptcy, the Cryptopia bankruptcy, BitConnect bankruptcy, and the Mt.Gox bankruptcy. Each instance highlights crucial lessons from crypto failures and the importance of regulatory compliance and risk management across the crypto industry. The recovery efforts following the FTX bankruptcy are ongoing. The now-defunct exchange has been able to recover over $7 billion to repay customers. The proceedings and repayment plans are being looked at by the bankruptcy court to streamline the process. Yes, individuals associated with the BitConnect scam had to bear legal consequences. For instance, Glenn Arcaro, one of the top BitConnect promoters, pleaded guilty to wire fraud and conspiracy and was enetually imprisoned. The BitConnect scam was around $2.4 billion and can be termed as one of the more infamous crypto exit scams. The platform promised high returns via a proprietary trading algorithm but went belly up, leaving behind significant investor losses.

The bill will go into effect on November 1, 2024. OKHB3594 was signed into law by Governor Kevin Stitt. It was sponsored by four Republicans — State Senators Bill Coleman and Dana Prieto and State Representatives Brian Hill and Cody Maynard. Under the bill, Oklahoma bans restricting or outlawing the use “or the self-custody of digital assets using a self-hosted wallet or a hardware wallet,” a page for the bill said. Oklahomans can also mine crypto both at home and industrially, though they have to comply with local noise ordinances.

Additionally, “discriminatory electricity rates for digital asset mining businesses are outlawed as well.” Residents can use crypto to pay for goods and services and are protected from paying additional taxes. “Digital assets used as a method of payment may not be subject to any additional tax, withholding, assessment or charge by the state or local government that is based solely on the use of the digital asset as the method of payment,” the bill continued.

One of the key benefits for those new to trading is the provision of a demo account, enabling them to familiarize themselves with the interface and hone their trading strategies without jeopardizing their funds. If you don’t have a Binance account. You can register here The trading simulator, also known as a demo account, on this cryptocurrency exchange, serves as a risk-free virtual account aimed at educating users and helping them develop their trading skills. It offers beginners a safe environment to navigate through the platform’s features, experiment with different strategies, and refine their trading abilities. Binance provides access to this simulator specifically for futures trading through the Binance Testnet. The emphasis on derivatives rather than spot trading stems from the heightened risks associated with futures trading. Furthermore, navigating through the Futures section on Binance can be complex, increasing the likelihood of beginners making inadvertent errors while initiating positions. Given the similarities between futures and spot orders, utilizing the trading simulator for Futures enables Binance users to also grasp the fundamentals of the interface used across various trading modalities. Therefore, it is recommended for novices to commence their journey in cryptocurrency trading and get acquainted with the exchange starting with a demo account. A test trading demo account is indispensable for individuals new to the world of trading. When used effectively, it can significantly minimize the risks of deposit losses due to a lack of experience and technical blunders. Nevertheless, similar to any instrument, a trading simulator has its set of pros and cons. However, it’s critical not to treat the demo account as a perfect substitute for a real trading terminal. It has several downsides that hinder the replication of an authentic trading experience with a real deposit: In sum, while the Binance Testnet trading simulator is a valuable resource for educational purposes, it lacks the capacity to completely mirror the intricacies and conditions of real trading, and it does not impose the emotional burdens—such as stress and pressure—that traders face when putting their own money on the line. The experience is incomparable to trading on a simulator. If your goal is to comprehensively understand the trading interface of the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, your best option is to utilize a demo account on the Binance Testnet. It’s accessible in the futures trading section, allowing you to experiment with Binance futures trading without putting your deposit at risk. However, it is imperative to recognize that the trading simulator is not a full substitute for a real trading terminal. A demo account can’t precisely mimic unpredictable market conditions and does not provide the trader with the level of involvement and emotional experience that comes with trading real money.

DCG objected to the distribution plan as it believes repayments should be capped at the crypto asset values of January 2023 (at the time of Genesis’ bankruptcy filing). Since then, the value of cryptos like Bitcoin has surged, with Bitcoin’s price jumping from around $21,000 to a current value of nearly $67,000. The firm also claimed that the plan provides too much return to creditors at DCG’s expense. Essentially, DCG feels that it is unfairly disadvantaged by how the returns are allocated. However, DCG’s arguments failed. Judge Sean Lane ruled that, as an equity holder, DCG’s financial interest isn’t directly impacted by how the assets are distributed. Equity holders only get paid after all creditors are satisfied. Additionally, given the insolvency and the massive creditor claims, DCG won’t receive any distribution under this plan. The total amount owed to creditors is billions of dollars higher than the debtors’ available assets. These claims have priority over equity holders like DCG, meaning they get paid first in line during bankruptcy. The ruling also considered the substantial $32 billion in claims from federal and state financial regulators, prioritizing them over DCG’s equity stake. Genesis had previously estimated that it could pay up to 77% of the value of customer claims, a figure subject to future market fluctuations. Hit hard by the collapse of Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and FTX, Genesis – along with other lending platforms – faced liquidity issues during the 2022 market downturn. This ultimately led the company to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January 2023. Genesis’ creditors include several prominent names, such as Gemini, Bybit’s Mirama, Decentraland, and VanEck. Adding to its troubles, Genesis Global Capital faced a legal lawsuit from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC accused Genesis and Gemini of selling unregistered securities through Gemini Earn. The company reached a $21 million settlement with the SEC in March this year.

6::https://theconversation.com/bitcoin-is-halving-again-what-does-that-mean-for-the-cryptocurrency-and-the-market-228213::The Conversation::article::Bitcoin is halving again – what does that mean for the cryptocurrency and the market?::There are reasons to believe that the bitcoin halving could keep the value of the currency high.::Bitcoin, the largest and most talked about digital asset, has been on a rollercoaster of a ride since its launch in January 2009. With a market capitalisation that reached a high of more than US$1.4 trillion (£1.125 trillion) this February and volatile swings since, bitcoin has attracted lots of attention recently. Now a hotly anticipated recurring event that happens roughly every four years is taking place: the bitcoin halving. This could have further significant impact on the value of the cryptocurrency. You can listen to more articles from The Conversation, narrated by Noa. To understand what the halving is and what it could mean, we have to understand how bitcoin works. Bitcoin is a digital currency that makes use of what’s called blockchain technology to securely store, record and publicly publish all transactions. It is distinct from fiat currencies, such as dollars or pounds, because it has no central authority and members of the network have equal power. Each transaction is made and recorded with the user’s public address, a code that enables them to remain anonymous. Bitcoins are created by so-called miners who contribute computing power to secure the network and solve complex mathematical puzzles in order to process transaction data. These miners are then rewarded for their work with newly minted bitcoins. The idea for bitcoin was first proposed in a white paper published online in 2008 by a mysterious individual or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. To combat inflation, Nakamoto wrote into the code that the total number of bitcoins will only ever be 21 million. Currently, more than 19.6 million bitcoins have been mined. At the beginning, back in 2009, miners received 50 bitcoins for every block (unit of transaction data) they mined. But after every 210,000 blocks (roughly every four years), the reward halves. So in 2012 the reward fell to 25 bitcoins, then to 12.5 bitcoins in 2016 and to 6.25 bitcoins in 2020. The latest halving means the reward will be just 3.125 bitcoins. Nakamoto has never explained explicitly the reasons behind the halving. Some speculate that the halving system was designed to distribute coins more quickly at the beginning to incentivise people to join the network and mine new blocks. Block rewards are programmed to halve at regular intervals because the value of each coin rewarded is deemed likely to increase as the network expands. But this may lead to users holding bitcoin as a speculative asset rather than using it as a medium of exchange. Additionally, the 21 million cap on the number of coins that can enter circulation makes them scarce (at least in comparison to dollars or euros), which for some people is enough to make them valuable. So what impact does the halving have on the price? After the halving, the number of new bitcoin entering circulation shrinks. Demand should, in theory, be unaffected by this event and therefore the price should go up. “The theory is that there will be less bitcoin available to buy if miners have less to sell,” said Michael Dubrovsky, a co-founder of PoWx, a crypto research non-profit. While the first halving happened in 2012, when bitcoin was less well known and quite hard to buy and sell, we can learn from the subsequent two halvings. The second halving on July 16 2016 was highly anticipated. The price dropped by 10%, but then shot back up to where it had been before. Although the immediate impact on the price was small, bitcoin did eventually respond and some argue that the 2017 bull run when the market boomed was a delayed result of the halving. Beginning the year around US$900, by the end of 2017 bitcoin was trading above US$19,000. The third halving in 2020 happened during a bullish period for bitcoin and it continued to rise to more than US$56,000 in 2021. These few data points are not enough however to offer any concrete causal relationship or trend. But we do know that instantly miners’ rewards are halved, meaning their revenue immediately halves and their profit margins are severely affected. Consequently, unless there is a price appreciation, many miners may become unprofitable and could cease the practice. Bitcoin’s scarcity is arguably one of its most significant characteristics, especially in a time of high inflation, quantitative easing and high interest rates. With the real value of fiat currencies falling, bitcoin’s limited supply is an attractive feature and can be reassuring for investors. Bitcoin hit an all-time high in February following the approval of bitcoin exchange-traded funds, which effectively make it easier for retail investors and big banks to invest in bitcoin. This, coupled with a more favourable regulatory environment on the horizon and the fact that it is becoming more integrated in the financial system, means bitcoin may continue on the rise it has experienced in 2024 so far.::2024-04-19T15:10:52Z::Audio narrated, Bitcoin, Blockchain, Crypto, Investing::Andrew Urquhart::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/588990/original/file-20240418-20-prjfv3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=808%2C1266%2C5110%2C2550&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

The SEC accused Terraform Labs and Kwon of misleading investors about the stability of its so-called “algorithmic” native stablecoin, Terra USD (UST), and the use cases for the Terra blockchain. The jury delivered the verdict on Friday, just two hours after lawyers for both the SEC and the defendants gave their closing arguments at the end of the nine-day trial in New York. Jurors agreed with the SEC that Kwon and, under his direction, Terraform Labs deceived everyday investors about the nature of the supposed algorithm that kept UST pegged to the U.S. dollar. Though Kwon insinuated that it could “automatically self-heal” in the event of a de-peg, it actually relied on continuous trading activity, including large-scale trading done by institutional investors. “We are pleased with today’s jury verdict holding Terraform Labs and Do Kwon liable for a massive crypto fraud,” Gurbir Grewal, SEC Division of Enforcement director, wrote in a statement. “The defendants caused devastating losses for investors and wiped out tens of billions of market value nearly overnight. For all of crypto’s promises, the lack of registration and compliance have very real consequences for real people. As the hard work of our team shows, we will continue to use the tools at our disposal to protect the investing public, but it is high time for the crypto markets to come into compliance,” Grewal added. SEC attorney Laura Meehan told the jury during her closing arguments on Friday that one of those institutional investors – Jump Trading – had made a secret deal with Kwon and Terraform Labs to rescue UST during a de-pegging event in May 2021, stepping in and buying millions of dollars of UST off-chain to reinflate its value and bring it back to parity with the dollar. Meehan added that, after Jump’s intervention, Kwon and his company intentionally kept the firm’s rescue mission quiet, wanting instead to use the re-pegging as evidence of the algorithm’s effectiveness. Lawyers for Terraform Labs and Kwon attempted to wave Jump’s involvement away as a regular part of their relationship with Terraform Labs as a market maker. They said that all “reasonable” investors knew that the algorithm that kept UST pegged to the dollar was not a “magical machine” or “computer that functioned on its own” but instead, minting and burning done by market participants. The jury, as evidenced by their verdict, did not agree. A spokesperson for Terraform Labs told CoinDesk: “We are very disappointed with the verdict, which we do not believe is supported by the evidence. We continue to maintain that the SEC does not have the legal authority to bring this case at all, and we are carefully weighing our options and next steps.” Kwon was not in Manhattan for his civil trial; instead, he was stuck in Montenegro, where he had been since his arrest in March 2023. Kwon was caught en route to Dubai attempting to use fake Costa Rican travel documents after months on the run. Kwon also faces criminal charges in the U.S. and his native South Korea, which are tied to the implosion of the Terra ecosystem. Both countries are currently vying for his extradition, but his final destination remains unclear as Montenegro's Supreme Court weighs the competing requests. UPDATE (19:10 UTC April 5): The story was updated to include a comment from a Terraform Labs spokesperson.

Binance Coin’s [BNB] momentum declined over the last week as the coin didn’t showcase much volatility. However, this might be the prelude to a massive rally, as BNB’s price was sitting at a crucial level that could allow it to reach a new all-time high. The last week remained relatively less volatile, as the coin’s price moved down by just 1.5%. In fact, in the last 24 hours, the coin didn’t move much.  According to CoinMarketCap, at the time of writing, BNB was trading at $580.59 with a market capitalization of over $85.6 billion. But investors must not lose hope, as the coin has a trick up its sleeve. AMBCrypto’s analysis of the coin’s price chart revealed a bullish pennant pattern. BNB entered the pattern in mid-March and, since then, has consolidated inside it. At press time, the coin was close to breaking out of the bull pattern. A successful breakout could translate into a massive bull rally, allowing it to go above its March highs. If things fall into place, then the coin might as well go above its ATH of $661 in the coming weeks or months. Source: TradingView A few of the on-chain metrics also looked pretty optimistic for the coin, as they supported the possibility of a breakout of the bullish pattern. For instance, BNB’s Funding Rate remained low. Generally, prices tend to move the other way than Funding Rates, hinting at a price uptick in the coming days. Source: Santiment Another good news was that the coin’s trading volume declined over the last few days, while its price action remained bearish. This meant that investors were not actively trading BNB, suggesting that the bearish trend might last longer. However, sentiments around BNB remained bearish, as evident from its low Weighted Sentiment. Another concerning metric was the coin’s Long/Short Ratio, which dropped at press time. A low ratio denotes a bearish sentiment, in which there is a greater inclination to short or sell assets. Source: Coinglass AMBCrypto then analyzed BNB’s daily chart to better understand whether the coin is expecting a breakout. As per our analysis, BNB’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) moved sideways near the neutral mark. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also followed a similar trend. Is your portfolio green? Check out the BNB Profit Calculator Similarly, the coin tested its 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at press time. If BNB manages to go above its 20-day EMA, then the chances of a successful breakout from the bullish pattern would increase substantially.

However, in an unpredictable field, it is useful to have a tool that analyzes the behavioral phases of crypto trading instead of the price and trend confirmations. This is where the Gator Oscillator comes in handy. This guide dives into the Gator Oscillator, examining its practical applications, calculation method, and analytical benefits. Here’s why it’s an essential oscillator for those seeking precise trading signals without the overload of multiple indicators. The Gator Indicator, also termed the Gator Oscillator, is a derivative or a sourced version of the famous Alligator Indicator. While the alligator indicator is made of moving averages, the Gator Oscillator is made of histograms. This tool helps users visualize and interpret the market’s behavior, helping them make sense of the various phases leading to or following a trend. Did you know? The Gator Oscillator was created by Bill Williams, a 1932-born trader who also created the trend-following Alligator Indicator, the Market Facilitation Index (MFI), and price pattern-evaluating Fractals. The Gator Oscillator relies on histogram analysis and features two histograms to work with. The histograms above the zero line and below the zero line can be all red, all green, or a mix of both, depending on the state of the market or the cryptocurrency you are analyzing. The Gator Oscillator is a simplified version of the Alligator indicator. The former doesn’t directly identify the trend’s direction but only captures the mood. It helps the traders make sense of market phases by dividing moves into the sleeping, awakening, eating, and weakening phases. These phases, when viewed in combination with the Alligator Indicator’s moving averages and the price action, help you with decision-making and even risk management. The idea is to look for the histogram analysis patterns to turn green and red from all red before you can consider entering a long position. The risk management element is taken care of when you start closing your open position, and all the green bars turn green and red, hinting at a sating phase. The Gator Oscillator is still a lagging indicator, showcasing the trend’s strength rather than the direction unless you use it to analyze the trading divergence. The calculation principle of the Gator Oscillator is based on how the Alligator Indicator moves. Therefore, it is necessary first to understand the elements of the latter: Note: These are the lines and moving average levels set by Bill Williams. The TradingView Gator Oscillator settings, like any other TradingView Indicator, could have slightly different values for the moving average. Notice how in the above TradingView Gator Oscillator and Alligator Indicator representation, the 5-period line is green, and the 13-period Jawline is red. In this case, the teeth are the blue line and smoothed as 9-period instead of 8-period of showcase mid-term trends instead of short-term. Each moving average is shifted forward by 8-period, 5-period, and 3-period to reduce the effects of the lagging indicator and make the Gator indicator more forward-looking. Now that the base is all set, let us focus on the calculation: As mentioned earlier, the Gator Oscillator comprises dual histograms comprising upper and lower bars. Each upper bar is the absolute difference between the 13-period and 8-period/9-period smoothed averages. Each lower bar is the difference between the 8-period/9-period and 5-period moving averages. The bars can be green and red, depending on the nature of the trend. We shall look into this while reading a gator oscillator. Reading the Gator Oscillator is all about understanding the elements. Notably, while this oscillator helps with the entry and exit points, it can signal the trend direction, provided you know how to read the trading divergence. The easiest way to read is to understand the phases of the Gator Oscillator, along with the colors. If both the histogram bars are red, expect the price action to be in the sleeping phase. This shows the market is in a consolidation phase, not rife for entry. If one histogram is in green and the other is in red, or are there multiple green-red bars, you might be looking at the awakening phase. This might reveal clear entry points and the potential start of a forming up trend. If both the histogram bars are green, expect the market to be in the eating phase. This is where traders take most of the profit, capitalizing on the momentum. When, after the eating phase, the bars again start showing mixed colors — red and green, you can expect the trend to lose momentum. This is where most traders exit positions and book profits. The size of the bars also reveals a lot in terms of price action. For instance, if the green and red bars in the awakening phase are smaller than the sleeping phase, you might want to look at other indicators and wait for a different entry point. If the price action and the formation of bars (bar size even) move in different directions, you might be looking at trading divergence. For instance, check the chart below. Despite the formation of red and green histogram bars, the price of BTC corrected instead of rising, as the bars were smallish and not aligned with the price action. Important: If the bars in the awakening zone are smaller than the ones encountered in the previous phase, the trend is not solid, and the price action might trade sideways for a while. Now that we know how to read this indicator, let’s take the BTC price chart and try to use the Gator Oscillator in real-time crypto trading. We shall now look at the historical chart of Bitcoin, starting in 2021 and following all the way till the peak formed towards the end of that year. The first encircled zone hints at a consolidation or sleeping phase with all-red, smallish bars. Then came the awakening phase with the broadening green bars and occasional red here and there. After this came the price surge, taking BTC to a new high of almost $58,000. Immediately after this high, the Gator indicator started showing green and red bars, hinting a correction and space for traders to exit the trade. The entire short-term journey is depicted by the A to D pathway. Note that these phases were between January and February 2021, and BTC embarked on several such journeys to reach a peak of almost $69,000 by the end of the year. In 2024, the price of BTC seems to be trading in the sleeping zone, slowly transitioning to the awakening zone. Yet, it is noticeable that the bars in the awakening zone aren’t as big as the ones in the last sated phase. This shows that BTC might keep moving in a range for now, making short-term highs and lows only from the trading perspective. Notice how the weekly BTC chart reveals a more accurate formation of the Gator Oscillator. The ellipse highlighting the oscillator’s specific zone reveals the eating zone, after which the sated zone arrives quickly with sizeable green and red bars. Based on the historical analysis, we expect the price action to be muted for a while before BTC enters the sleeping zone. After that, we need to look for the color and size of the bars, per the histogram analysis, to locate the next leg of the trend. However, besides the technical analysis, broader crypto market sentiments also plays a key role in determining BTC’s price action. “Technical analysis is massively important and should not be ignored. Sentiment is a great way to gauge markets too, and news does move the market in unexpected ways sometimes. But more often than not we can at least get some early indications in the charts. I.e, Bitcoin at 73k saw seven months of green candles, a near historic run, a correction was coming if you could think without greed and euphoria clouding your mind. A MACD bear cross came the day after hitting the high; an early warning sign of trouble to come. But while this was happening the market was wildly euphoric, Blackrock ETF buyers bought a billion that day. So, yes, sentiment is important but it works as a counter indicator. Try to think against the herd.” The Gator Oscillator is best read with the Alligator Indicator. This means it is imperative to locate the oscillator’s awakening phase when the Alligator Indicator’s moving averages start diverging in the following order — 5-period, 8-period/9-period, and 13-period. At its heart, the Alligator Indicator is all about finding the golden crossover patterns in relation to the price action. The Gator Oscillator helps validate these patterns. The Gator Oscillator is a secondary indicator you pair with the Alligator moving averages. The histogram bars take shape depending on the convergence and divergence of the Alligator or the primary indicator. For near-accurate technical analysis, you might want to pair the Gator Oscillator with the following crypto trading indicators: MACD helps locate the potential reversals and trend-based momentum. To use the Gator Oscillator with the MACD indicator, you might want to focus on the convergence and divergence between the two indicators to get the strongest possible trading signals. The Bitcoin price action chart shows the blue line of the MACD threatening to drop under the orange line, hinting at bearishness. The sated phase or zone of the Gator Oscillator validates the MACD-specific finding. Both these indicators suggest that BTC might move in a range or even correct a little in the short-to-mid-term. The relative strength indicator measures the price change and speed of price action, eventually helping to determine oversold and overbought market conditions. Using it with the gator oscillator is simple. You need to locate an RSI divergence, bullish or bearish, and analyze it with the existing zone of the oscillator is in. Besides these indicators, crypto traders must value fundamental analysis for long-term wealth creation. The most successful people in the financial world like Buffet, Dalio, Soros, Marks and Lynch are not day traders and don't use technical analysis. That stuff works, but not for most people and it's not the optimal way to get rich from #crypto. Fundamental analysis is 😘 And… If you want to use the Gator Oscillator to transform your trading performance, here are the best strategies to follow: Even though the Gator Oscillator is a powerful trading tool that helps you identify the sentiment of the trading crowd — calm, excited, or somewhere in the middle — it is best paired with other trading indicators, especially trend-confirming ones like RSI. Additionally, it’s important to note that the Gator Oscillator indicator works best across a longer timeframe. This means it works best with more established/mature cryptocurrencies with discernable historical data to analyze. Trading with the Gator Oscillator requires you to choose a longer time frame, say weekly. Once you have the weekly chart, look for a phase when the histogram analysis, relative to the mid-line of the histogram, showcases big, red-green bars after a smallish all-red bar phase. This is termed the awakening phase, when most traders enter long positions. The Alligator strategy does offer reliable trading signals. When paired with the price action, this is one of the trading indicators that uses short-term moving averages for technical analysis. Alligator strategy works well in crypto market analysis as you capture the asset’s volatility without relying on multiple trading indicators. The Alligator pattern in crypto trading corresponds to the multiple behavioral phases of the alligator — sleeping, waking, eating, and sating — to analyze the inclination of traders. Trading oscillators like the Gator Oscillator are formed using the alligator pattern and are useful for helping traders locate the best times to enter and exit crypto trading positions. Reading a Gator indicator is easy. Use histogram analysis, keeping the middle or zero lines as a reference. If the bars on both sides of the middle line are red, the price action or trend is expected to be sleeping. You might wish to enter trades if the bars turn green and red. However, it is important to note that the bar size during the awakening or trade-entering phase shouldn’t be smaller than the sleeping phase. After that comes a phase where all bars are green, relevant to the middle line. This is where you, as a trader, can book most profits. You should exit trades before the histogram bars again turn red-green.

The New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) cleared the fund group — managing $106 billion in assets — to operate as a limited purpose trust company under the state’s banking law, WisdomTree said Friday. The charter allows the firm to custody digital assets, as well as issue, exchange and manage the reserves of DFS-approved stablecoins. The newly formed WisdomTree Digital Trust Company intends to issue its gold and dollar tokens and maintain reserves for those assets, the company noted. The company is also set to make its WisdomTree Prime app available to New York customers in the coming weeks, the firm said in a news release.

Eric Balchunas predicts sustained growth for spot Bitcoin ETFs, highlighting increased demand.::Spot Bitcoin ETFs have successfully reversed April’s outflows within the first two weeks of May. Eric Balchunas, Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg, highlighted that Bitcoin ETFs have already attracted $1.3 billion in inflows this month, effectively countering April’s negative outflows. This brings the total inflows to $12.3 billion since their inception. Balchunas emphasized that fluctuations in capital movements are a natural aspect of ETFs and should not concern investors. He remains confident that spot Bitcoin ETFs will deliver positive long-term returns. CryptoQuant reports that this resurgence in activity is coupled with renewed demand for Bitcoin. Both regular holders and large investors are increasing their Bitcoin holdings, indicating a heightened market interest. Recent data from SoSo Value confirms that spot Bitcoin ETFs have experienced a robust recovery from April’s downturn. On May 16, these funds reported $257.34 million in inflows. Leading the pack is BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which secured $94 million in inflows, boosting its assets under management to $18 billion, just shy of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC). On the same day, GBTC recorded a net daily inflow of $5 million, marking the third consecutive trading day it closed in positive territory since its transition from a trust to a spot ETF. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

What to expect next?::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Bitcoin (BTC) may have exited the post-halving “danger zone” and entered the accumulation phase, according to data shared by technical analyst Rekt Capital. He suggests that the selling pressure behind Bitcoin’s price is weakening. #BTC The Post-Halving Bitcoin "Danger Zone" (purple) is officially over And Bitcoin is celebrating with a good bounce from the Re-Accumulation Range Low support$BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin https://t.co/3pvWKRAqNd pic.twitter.com/KRD2UNDZiT — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) May 13, 2024 Following the halving event, Bitcoin typically experiences a “danger zone” characterized by heightened volatility. In the 2016 cycle, Bitcoin’s value dropped nearly 18% in the three weeks that followed. This specific downturn came back in this halving cycle, albeit with a mild 6.5% decline over the same period. However, this was briefly followed by a 15% surge, suggesting a strong exit from the “danger zone”. At the time of reporting, Bitcoin is trading at nearly $62,600, marking a 3% increase in the last 24 hours. Rekt Capital notes that the $60,000 support level is crucial for the continuation of this upward trend, potentially leading to a return to the $68,000 mark. “History suggests it means that Bitcoin will no longer produce downside volatility below its current Re-Accumulation Range,” Rekt Capital explained in his recent blog post. “The Bitcoin correction should be over and price should be able to maintain itself above $60,000 going forward.” While historical trends do not guarantee future results, the current support level’s resilience is a positive sign for Bitcoin’s trajectory. A major focus this week will be the April Consumer Price Index (CPI), which will be released on Wednesday. Forecasts for the CPI and core CPI are 3.4% and 3.6%, respectively. The Federal Reserve’s (Fed) target is 2% and current data shows inflation remains stubborn. Rates might stay high for a longer period unless inflation improves. According to BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes, rising government debt and adjustments by the Fed and US Treasury are making alternative investments like Bitcoin more appealing. He predicts that Bitcoin’s price will exceed $60,000 and move to a period of relative stability between $60,000 and $70,000 by August. The upcoming US presidential election could also influence Bitcoin’s value, according to Standard Chartered. The bank believes a potential win for Donald Trump could benefit Bitcoin’s value. Additionally, the US’s fiscal and monetary policy shift is seen as potentially favorable for Bitcoin. Standard Chartered expects BTC’s price to reach $150,000 by year’s end and $200,000 by 2025.

13::https://theconversation.com/protecting-the-right-to-be-forgotten-in-the-age-of-blockchain-104847::The Conversation::article::Protecting the ‘right to be forgotten’ in the age of blockchain::Blockchain data is unchangeable, which is a problem when privacy laws require companies to delete data once it’s served its purpose.::There’s been a lot of hype about blockchain over the past year. Although best known as the technology that underpins Bitcoin, blockchain is starting to disrupt other industries, from supply chains to energy trading. One of the key selling points of blockchain is that once data is added to the chain, it can’t be changed or removed. This makes blockchain trustworthy. But this same immutability makes blockchain problematic in a world where privacy laws require companies to delete your data from databases once it has served its purpose. This is known in some jurisdictions as the “right to be forgotten”. We have designed a blockchain in which users can remove their data from the database without violating blockchain’s consistency. Read more: Blockchain is useful for a lot more than just Bitcoin There is currently a growing market of Internet of Things devices, from smart homes and self-driving cars to voice assistants and smart energy meters. These devices continuously collect digital biographies of our lives. As this data is increasingly being stored on blockchains, the tension between blockchain and the right to be forgotten will only increase. Our tool could help. At its core, blockchain is a database that is jointly managed by a distributed set of participants. Whenever new data is added to the database, all the participants must agree to verify it. In this way, blockchain removes the need for a third-party, such as a bank, to verify transactions. The blockchain ledger is organised into blocks, where each block is linked to the previous block through cryptographic hash functions. These functions create a short code based on the content of the previous block, and it is not possible to guess this code without trying all possible codes. Chaining the blocks in this manner ensures that the data stored in them cannot be altered, as any changes made would break the blockchain consistency. This makes blockchains immutable. It also makes blockchain data easy to trace and audit, particularly for large networks like the Internet of Things. These features are highly attractive for organisations operating across organisational boundaries, and in environments where participants may not fully trust each other. The European Union’s recent General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a significant piece of legislation that is at odds with a digital economy underpinned by blockchain. The GDPR requires companies that hold people’s data to erase that data once the original purpose they needed it for is complete. That means that people must be able to remove their data from third party databases after a certain period of time. Blockchain – being unchangeable – presents an obstacle to exercising that right. Read more: What Wikipedia can teach us about blockchain technology Let’s say you live in smart home that uses sensor data to monitor your home security. You have a home insurance policy and, in order to receive lower premiums, you allow your smoke alarm and security sensor data to be recorded on a blockchain. The blockchain data can be accessed by the police, the fire department and the insurance company so they can audit any smoke alarm or security events. Once your insurance period has ended, you should be able to remove your security data from the blockchain to enhance your privacy. If you left your data on the blockchain indefinitely, that would increase the risk of your data being identified as yours, and your activities being tracked by any entity with access to the blockchain. A blockchain participant typically uses one or more public keys as its identities. The transactions in blockchain are stored anonymously, as there is no direct link between the public keys and the real participant identity. But a breach in identity in any of the transactions, for instance by linking the transaction content to other known data about the user, leads to all interactions of the users’s devices, stored in blockchain, to be tracked by all blockchain participants. So being able to the remove data from the blockchain without “breaking the chain” would be beneficial for user privacy. It would also be beneficial to save storage space on the servers that store blockchain ledgers. But currently, removing data from a blockchain is not possible without breaking the blockchain’s consistency. We have come up with a solution that makes it possible to remove your detailed transaction data from a blockchain database, without removing the auditable trace that the transaction took place. As described in our peer-reviewed publication this month, Memory Optimised Flexible Blockchain allows you to temporarily store, summarise, or completely remove your transactions from blockchain, while maintaining the blockchain’s consistency. The remaining trace of the data (its hash) on the blockchain can still be used in the future, in case disputes over what happened arise. For instance, if a home owner wanted to verify that a break-in took place at their house under a previous insurance policy, they could provide a private copy of the data with its associated hash. A legal authority could then compare the hash of the person’s data with the hash that is still stored on the shared blockchain and thereby validate the authenticity of the person’s claim. This approach provides you with full administrative control of your blockchain-stored data. It makes it possible for you to remove or summarise this data, without sacrificing the ability to audit the data in the future. Read more: Using blockchain to secure the 'internet of things' It is important to note that our published approach can run atop any existing blockchain solution, and does not affect the blockchain consistency. The links among blocks through hash functions are preserved, even as specific blocks are removed or summarised from the chain. In other words, the link of any blockchain entry remains, but the bag containing some data can be cut loose. In fact, as long as the removed content is stored privately outside of the blockchain, the data’s authenticity can be independently verified at a later time by comparing it against the hash in the blockchain. In this way, you can reclaim control of any previously shared data and exercise your right to be forgotten in the age of blockchain.::2018-10-30T18:56:34Z::Blockchain, Data privacy, GDPR, Right to be forgotten::Ali Dorri::Home::https://images.theconversation.com/files/242650/original/file-20181029-7056-6xa09e.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C440%2C7000%2C3500&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

The ETCs, which carry the Frankfurt-based company's Xtrackers branding, were developed in conjunction with digital asset financial services firm Galaxy Digital (GLXY). They were listed on the Deutsche Boerse on Thursday, according to a DWS statement. The products, the Xtrackers Galaxy Physical Bitcoin ETC and Xtrackers Galaxy Physical Ethereum ETC, track the performance of the two largest cryptocurrencies by market value and carry a fee of 0.35%. That's cheaper than rivals such as 21Shares Bitcoin ETP (ABTC), listed in Switzerland and Germany, which charges 1.49%, and Amsterdam-listed Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF (BCOIN) with 1.5% While spot crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) have been available in Europe for several years – CoinShares' Physical Bitcoin ETP, for example, was listed in 2021, and Zurich-based 21Shares says it introduced the world's first physically backed ETP in 2018 – they've come more into focus since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved a bunch of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the world's biggest economy in January. The U.S. funds have attracted a net inflow of about $12 billion in less than three months, according to BitMEX Research. DWS, which has 896 billion euros ($970 billion) under management, and Galaxy Digital teamed up a year ago to develop exchange-traded products (ETPs) for listing in Europe.

Cardano [ADA] has surged back to the $0.48 price point, which is a major turnaround as billions in investments move from loss to potential profit. This comeback comes at an important time for holders who bought at or above this threshold, changing the sentiment from red to a promising green. Investors who placed their bets on ADA at the average price of $0.48 are now seeing their patience pay off. With the token reclaiming that value, those previously underwater are finally breaking even.  A predominantly bullish sentiment is showcased by IntoTheBlock’s data, which indicates a “Mostly Bullish” outlook by investors at press time. This upswing is underpinned by a modest 0.11% net network growth and a 3.08% increase in holders ‘In the Money,’ meaning that a larger number of investors are seeing profits. Source: IntoTheBlock However, investors should remain cautious, as the dashboard also reveals a -7.46% drop in large transactions, suggesting a decrease in major institutional activities. Furthermore, a notable bid-ask volume imbalance (-16.57%) points towards potential selling pressure. This means it is necessary to be vigilant of market dynamics in order to ascertain the sustainability of this rally in ADA’s price. The one-hour ADA trading chart showed an uptick in price movement, briefly touching the $0.48 mark before consolidating around $0.4776 at press time. The volume spike accompanying the price rise confirmed strong buyer interest at lower price levels. But the bulls are still not in full control. This consolidation indicates a balancing act between the bulls and the bears, with neither side taking definitive control. Source: TradingView Read Cardano’s [ADA] Price Prediction 2024-25 Given the current consolidation pattern and the observed trading volume, ADA may continue to test the $0.48 resistance. If buyer momentum increases, breaking this level could see further gains, otherwise, expect some sideways movement as the market seeks new catalysts or data points to drive the next price action.

Polkadot launched in 2020, aiming to develop a network of blockchain platforms akin to Ethereum. It features a main chain known as the relay chain and several parallel chains or parachains. Developers build these parachains on top of the Polkadot protocol. Each operates with its own rules and policies, essentially functioning as independent decentralized applications (DApps). Polkadot operates on a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus method, requiring users to stake or lock in their assets to participate. This enhances network security and allows users to earn interest as a reward for their involvement. First, I have to explain to you step by step the current system so you can understand where I'm going ➡️ Polkadot has a relay chain or 'main chain' which provides security, consensus, and interoperability to the parachains connected to it 🔌. To obtain all these advantages of… pic.twitter.com/8kRsmdUH06 The parachains handle and process the transactions, which are sent to the relay chain for final validation. This two-step process reduces congestion on the relay chain, enabling Polkadot to scale efficiently and process more than 1000 transactions per second. DOT, the native cryptocurrency of the Polkadot network, is essential for governance, staking, and bonding parachains, highlighting its fundamental role within the Polkadot ecosystem. By bonding parachains through DOT, users help to secure new chains to the Polkadot network, further promoting an interconnected crypto community. As of May 1, 2024, the price of Polkadot is $6.78 as per CoinMarketCap data, with a market cap of $9,754,511,094. The coin reached its all-time high of $55.00 on Nov. 4, 2021. Choosing the best wallet to store DOT involves considering various factors to ensure your crypto assets’ security and functionality. Additionally, it’s important to learn how to properly set up a crypto wallet to ensure your assets remain secure. When selecting a wallet, assess ease of use and security measures. Here are some pointers to include in your decision-making and investment process: Ultimately, the best Polkadot wallet depends on your specific needs, and it’s important to consider your own personal requirements before making your choice. For example, eToro Wallet offers access to traditional stocks as well as crypto. OKX Wallet supports DOT while offering a gateway to web3. With YouHodler Wallet, users can engage in lending and other DeFi services. Ledger is a top hardware wallet option for long-term HODLers, while Coinbase Wallet is the perfect entry point for those new to crypto. Always DYOR, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. DOT is the native coin of the Polkadot network, specifically designed for governance, staking, and bonding to facilitate the connection of parachains. This crypto enables unique functionalities within the Polkadot ecosystem, enhancing interoperability and scalability. Before investing in Polkadot, you should consider your investment goals and risk tolerance. The network’s innovative multi-chain architecture may provide long-term growth potential. However, investing in any crypto carries inherent risks. Remember to assess the current market dynamics and do your own research beforehand. To store DOT securely, BeInCrypto highly recommends using platforms such as Coinbase Wallet, OKX Wallet, Ledger, YouHodler Wallet, or eToro. These options offer various features that meet the needs of both beginners and seasoned users, ensuring safe storage for your DOT.

Weeks after FTX collapsed, CEO David Solomon penned an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal asserting that experienced institutions should be leading the path. “Although some blockchain start-ups are calling for regulatory oversight, not all have the capability to meet such requirements because they are young organizations,” Solomon wrote in the op-ed. Policy developments around the digital asset space are encouraging, McDermott said, and allow for more financial institutions to enter the space. From our opinion section: DeFi needs institutions — and regulation “I look at the regulatory landscape globally and at how that’s progressed in the last couple years, and…it’s actually been pretty remarkable,” McDermott said. “That has actually given a lot of clarity and confidence, quite frankly, for probably a lot of the traditional players to really kind of move forward and invest in this space.” When asked if and when the bank may expand its on-chain services via public blockchains, McDermott said there are currently some compliance hurdles, but he hopes the team can move in that direction. “Personally, I can see a huge opportunity there,” McDermott said. “But if I put my Goldman hat on, I just know what we can do from a regulatory perspective. It’s something that I think we kind of monitor [and] watch mature.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. Subscribe to the Empire newsletter.

More than 80 billion NOT tokens have been distributed, with a significant majority, exceeding 90%, delivered directly to participants engaged as “miners” on the platform. Notcoin, a pioneering play-to-earn clicker game that operates via the Telegram app, announced its recent airdrop through an official press release. The initiative saw the allocation of over 80.2 billion NOT tokens to community members active on The Open Network blockchain. According to the announcement, 90% of these tokens have been designated for “miners,” while the remaining 7.9 billion are accessible through the redemption of non-fungible token (NFT) vouchers. This development precedes Notcoin’s anticipated inclusion on various prominent centralized exchanges, including Binance, OKX, and Bybit. Eligible community members can claim their NOT tokens within the Notcoin app, with provisions for on-chain withdrawal concurrent with the token’s exchange listing, as detailed in the press release. Ryan Dennis, the Brand Director at TON Foundation, remarked on the game’s rapid ascent and cultural impact. “Notcoin has not only emerged as the fastest-growing and most popular game in blockchain history, but it has also become a cultural phenomenon, cultivating one of the largest and most engaged communities in the Web3 space,” he stated. Sasha Plotvinov, founder of Open Builders—a collective of blockchain developers centered around The Open Network—emphasized the ecosystem’s commitment to transparency and equitable distribution. He noted that these principles are vital for fostering realistic visions of mass crypto adoption. Launched in late 2023, Notcoin has innovatively leveraged The Open Network blockchain to offer a unique gaming experience. Players engage by “mining” NOT tokens through simple screen taps while operating the Notcoin mini-app on mobile devices. Following the game’s traction, the Notcoin team facilitated the conversion of in-game balances to NOT tokens at a ratio of 1000:1, thereby transforming every thousand in-game Notcoin into one NOT token. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

19::https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-layer-2-expansion/::Crypto Briefing::article::Bitcoin layer-2 landscape "set to boom" as BTC keeps outperforming: Bybit::Bitcoin Layer 2s gain momentum with new solutions and increased security.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Bitcoin (BTC) layer-2 (L2) blockchains will continue to grow as BTC continues to outperform other major crypto in 2024, according to a report by crypto exchange Bybit. Bitcoin’s market dominance has surged to 51.1% as of May 7, signaling a robust uptrend since late September 2023. This growth is largely attributed to the US approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which has bolstered Bitcoin’s trading volume. Bybit reports an 18% increase in BTC holdings month-over-month from March to April 2024, with Bitcoin’s trading volume now representing 31.8% of the total. The L2 landscape is enhancing the utility of BTC and leveraging the security of Bitcoin mining. While they face challenges due to the Bitcoin blockchain’s architecture and community resistance to change, the success of projects like Ordinals and Runes suggests that innovation can drive community growth. As Bitcoin maintains its proof of work (PoW) status and outperforms other blockchains, the potential for Bitcoin L2 development remains vast. This growth has catalyzed the development of Bitcoin L2 solutions, designed to enhance scalability, reduce transaction costs, and introduce programmability to the Bitcoin network. These solutions include state channels, sidechains, and rollups. State channels like the Lightning Network facilitate faster, more cost-effective transactions by allowing off-chain updates between parties. However, they face limitations in capacity and lack smart contract functionality. RGB, a new project, aims to overcome these challenges by integrating smart contract capabilities with the Lightning Network. Sidechains operate independently but maintain a connection to the Bitcoin mainnet through bridges, enabling asset transfers. Projects like Stacks and Rootstock are well-established, while newcomers like AILayer boast the highest total value locked (TVL) due to its AI integration and anticipated airdrop. Rollups, which batch transactions for settlement on the mainnet, are divided into optimistic and zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups. ZK-rollups, in particular, are favored for their lower transaction costs. Merlin Chain leads the ZK-rollup space with a TVL of $1.1 billion, thanks to its early launch and vibrant DApp ecosystem. Despite these advancements, Bitcoin L2 solutions face inherent risks, including security vulnerabilities, interoperability challenges, and counterparty risks, Bybit points out. These risks mirror those encountered by early Ethereum L2 solutions.

20::https://theconversation.com/blockchains-wont-fix-internet-voting-security-and-could-make-it-worse-104830::The Conversation::article::Blockchains won’t fix internet voting security – and could make it worse::The stability and integrity of democratic society are too important to be relegated to inherently flawed computer systems that are vulnerable to malfunctions and malicious attacks.::Looking to modernize voting practices, speed waiting times at the polls, increase voter turnout and generally make voting more convenient, many government officials – and some companies hawking voting systems – are looking to an emerging technology called a “blockchain.” That’s what’s behind a West Virginia program in which some voters serving abroad in the military will be able to cast their votes from their mobile devices. Similar voting schemes have been tried elsewhere in various places around the world. As researchers in the Initiative for CryptoCurrencies and Contracts, we believe in the transformative potential of blockchain systems in a number of industries. Best known as the technology behind bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, blockchains can do much more than allow anonymous strangers to send each other money without fear of fraud or tampering. They have created new ways for people to invest in technology ventures that have attracted billions of dollars, and may someday store records that make educational credentials, land ownership and food origins more transparent and harder to forge. Blockchains might sound like an ideal remedy for the trust problems caused by internet voting. Data can only be added to a blockchain – not deleted or changed – because multiple copies are stored on computers owned by different people or organizations and perhaps spread across different countries. Strict controls can be placed on a blockchain’s contents, preventing unauthorized data from being added. And blockchains are designed to be transparent – with their contents often readable by anyone’s computing device anywhere in the world. Yet as scholars who have studied traditional and blockchain-based voting, we believe that while blockchains may help with some specific issues, they can’t fix the basic problems with internet voting. In fact, they could make things worse. For years, experts on election security have warned that the internet is too dangerous for such socially crucial and time-sensitive functions as voting. Renowned cryptographer Ronald Rivest, for instance, has remarked that “Best practices for internet voting are like best practices for drunk driving” – there’s no safe way to do either one. The stakes are enormous. Democracy requires widespread public trust – not just that a declared winner actually received the largest number of votes, but in the integrity of the system as a whole. People need to trust that the votes they cast are the ones that are counted, that their neighbors’ votes are totaled accurately and not the result of bribery or coercion and that local tallies are communicated safely to state election officials. Even advanced computing devices today cannot provide such assurances. Most hardware and software are rife with hidden security flaws, and are not regularly updated. Devices are vulnerable, and so are networks. Internet outages – even caused by trivialities like gamers trying to get a leg up on their competitors – could prevent people from voting. Intentional, targeted attacks against internet traffic could cause major disruptions to democratic institutions on a national scale. The stability and integrity of democratic society itself are too important to be relegated to flawed computer systems. Hackers – backed by foreign governments or not – are always looking for new targets and fresh ways to sow social discord. They’ll find – and fully exploit – any technical weaknesses available to them. Without a paper trail, the very possibility that someone could have secretly changed votes will further erode public trust in democratic elections.  A key method by which blockchain voting could worsen election integrity is by claiming to increase trustworthiness without actually doing so. It’s easy to imagine a voting system in which only authorized voters could cast ballots, with those ballots indelibly recorded on a blockchain. The blockchain would act as a single authoritative election record that could not be erased or tampered with. For all intents and purposes, the record would be hack-proof. However, tallying votes on a blockchain doesn’t magically make a voter’s phone or computer secure. A vote may be securely recorded, but that means nothing if the vote was cast incorrectly to begin with. If your phone is infected with malware that switches your vote from Candidate R to Candidate D, it doesn’t matter how secure the rest of the voting system is – the election has still been hacked. In some cases, blockchains may be able to help voters detect that sort of tampering – but only if the hack-detection software itself hasn’t been hacked. In addition, some companies’ business practices undermine the potential to trust their blockchain systems. The manufacturer of the system West Virginia will use in November – like many companies manufacturing physical voting machines – is refusing to embrace the transparency that is central to the security industry, the blockchain community, and democracy itself. They are not providing public access to the cryptographic protocols at the heart of their systems, leaving the public instead to rely on the manufacturer’s promises of security. There’s no way for an independent auditor to be truly certain that the systems are free of subtle bugs or security flaws – or even massive holes that would be obvious to experts. Another way blockchain voting could worsen existing voting problems is by increasing the likelihood of vote buying. Sometimes a glass of beer is all that’s needed to bribe a voter. Vote buying is happily rare in large-scale U.S. elections, in part because the secret ballot makes verifying a bought vote very difficult and because there are serious criminal penalties. Internet voting could completely negate both of these protections. Putting votes on blockchains eliminates the secrecy of the voting booth. Encryption doesn’t help: Software can prove mathematically to a vote buyer that a voter’s device encrypted the name of a particular candidate. In addition, foreigners who might try to influence people’s votes are very hard to prosecute. Some voting companies contend that their systems publicly identify voters only by random numerical identifiers, so they aren’t subject to vote-buying or intimidation. But in many of these systems, voting identities can be linked to accounts in cryptocurrency systems – where a voter could receive a bribe, potentially without revealing who was paid, how much or by whom. Officials and companies who promote online voting are creating a false sense of security – and putting the integrity of the election process at risk. In seeking to use blockchains as a protective element, they may in fact be introducing new threats into the crucial mechanics of democracy.::2018-10-18T10:34:12Z::Blockchain, Cybersecurity, Democracy, Election integrity, Online voting, Public trust, Voting, e-voting, voting integrity::Ari Juels::Home::https://images.theconversation.com/files/240662/original/file-20181015-165894-6jjdjj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C1404%2C6006%2C2998&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

Gold has outperformed, and this may benefit bitcoin (BTC), Coinbase (COIN) said in a research report on Friday. “Given the market’s recent hawkish views on rate cuts, we think gold’s performance signals an overweighting on inflation relative to Fed rate changes as well as an overall belief that certain inflation bumps could materialize more problematically than anticipated,” the report said. “Bitcoin’s increased acceptance as a form of ‘digital gold’ could enable demand from a new subset of investors in this regime,” wrote analyst David Han. “As a result, we think dips are likely to be more aggressively bought compared to previous cycles, even as volatility persists during price discovery.” Among other macroeconomic signals that inflation may not be entirely subdued, the U.S. jobs market continues to surprise to the upside. The economy added 303,000 jobs last month, the government said Friday. That's the strongest headline number since last May and it beat economist forecasts of 200,000 and February’s 270,000 additions. The cryptocurrency’s wider access to capital following the launch of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. could result in less volatility, according to the report. The capital unlocked by spot ETFs “perhaps represents the most fundamental shift in market structure between the previous 2020-21 cycle and today,” Coinbase said. This capital injection, coupled with the bitcoin halving coming later this month and other positive catalysts, makes Coinbase still largely positive on its outlook for crypto markets for the second quarter. The quadrennial halving is when miner rewards are slashed by 50%, thereby reducing the rate of growth in the supply of bitcoin. The next halving is expected to occur around April 20.

22::https://ambcrypto.com/why-polkadots-dot-price-bounce-will-not-come-anytime-soon/::AMBCrypto::article::Why Polkadot’s [DOT] price bounce will not come anytime soon::Despite a 6.61% weekly increase, DOT's decreased volume suggests market disinterest.::Despite a 6.61% weekly increase, DOT’s decreased volume suggests market disinterest.  A significant decrease in its daily trading volume has put Polkadot [DOT] at risk of another decline. Volume is not necessarily an indicator of a price increase. If the trading volume increases, it means that there is a lot of exchange going on with a token. Conversely, a decline in the metric suggests that interest in a cryptocurrency has decreased. For Polkadot, data from Artemis.xyz showed that the volume was $137.80 million. This was one of the lowest the project has seen since the second quarter of the year began.  However, the price of DOT has increased by 6.61% in the last seven days. But a massive decline in the volume could be a stumbling block to that hike. Source: Artemis Previously, there have been predictions that DOT could ride back to $10. If the volume pumps as the price increases, then this forecast might become a reality. But that was not the case, as rising prices and decreasing volume indicate weakness in the trend. As such, DOT could swing between $7.15 and $7.60 in the short term. Furthermore, AMBCrypto looked at Polkadot’s development activity as this was one aspect the project has dominated. According to Santiment, development activity on the network was 2.92. Two days ago, the reading of the metric was 2.20, indicating that more codes have been committed to ensure that Polkadot functions properly For some projects, a rise in development activity is a bullish sign for the price. But for DOT, it is not always the case. Sometimes, DOT’s price rises with the metric. Other times, the price does not follow. Therefore, this network improvement cannot be said to be a propeller to drive the token’s value higher. Apart from this, AMBCrypto checked the social volume. When social volume increases, it implies that the search for a project is increasing. On the other hand, if the social volume dwindles, it suggests that arbitrary text linked to DOT is on the decline. Source: Santiment At press time, Polkadot’s social volume jumped on the 17th of May. On the 18th, the metric fell. For the price, this means that demand for DOT was low. Hence, a 25%+ price increase might be unattainable in the short term. Meanwhile, the metrics discussed here are not the only one that has the potential to influence DOT’s price. Is your portfolio green? Check the Polkadot Profit Calculator To get a full understanding, other on-chain indicators like network growth can also impact the value. If the network growth rises, demand for DOT could lead the price to increase. However, that has not been the case, indicating that DOT’s potential to hit double-digits might not be an option this month.

While other trend-following crypto trading indicators for technical analysis include the Moving Average Convergence Divergence and the Parabolic SAR, the ZigZag indicator stands out for its simplistic approach in helping you identify swing highs and lows. This guide explores everything about the ZigZag Indicator, including its ability to spot potential bullish and bearish signals, usefulness across multiple timeframes, and best practices. The ZigZag pattern in crypto identifies and visualizes a clear pivot point that easily determines bullish and bearish trends. Notably, the pattern isn’t out-and-out predictive. Instead, it adjusts depending on changing market conditions. The pattern isolates movements that are essential for trend identification and price action monitoring. The ZigZag indicator is a technical analysis resource that can clearly identify swing highs and lows using straight lines. This indicator can be paired with the Fibonacci Retracement tool to help locate key support and resistance levels. Here are the basic features of this indicator: Look up "ZigZag" default indicator on TV. Might be handy for volume analysis as it calculates cumulative vol of each swings. I don't use vol for my index trades, but this could be useful for stocks swing trading on HTF pic.twitter.com/uoYXTNvRAW If you have previously used the Bollinger Bands indicator, you will know the importance of indicator settings. Let us look at what that means for the ZigZag and how the settings help in reading the indicator. The indicator depth signifies the lowest number of bars between the potential low and the potential high. As the name suggests, increasing the depth will result in fewer price-specific fluctuations, with the lines expected to move in one direction for longer. When the line reverses, indicating a reversal, the visualization becomes more significant. The deviation refers to the percentage of the minimum price move needed for the indicator to change course. If the deviation is set high, smaller price moves are flushed out. The depth and deviation settings also determine the minimum number of bars formed between the swing lows and highs, which the Backstep count determines. To calculate or plot the ZigZag indicator, you first need to choose a starting point. Say, for the sake of illustration, this is $67232, per the latest Bitcoin price chart (shown above). Now that we have chosen the deviation to be 10%, the next low would never be considered if the Bitcoin price doesn’t fall by 10% of $67,232. This is why you can see the line from the starting point continuing. Also, it is worth mentioning that the ZigZag is a lagging indicator and only captures the trend. It isn’t predictive in nature. Also, reading this indicator should always be done in tandem with chart patterns, candlestick analysis, Fibonacci retracement levels, and the Elliot Wave formations — all of which we will discuss while exploring trading strategies. Did you know? Candlestick charting, integral to technical analysis, was developed in 18th-century Japan by rice trader Munehisa Homma, who used it to interpret market emotions and investor sentiment. This technique gained global prominence in the 1980s through the works of Steve Nison. As for the best ZigZag indicator setting, you can use the following table as your trial-and-error guide, optimized for scalping, day trading, swing trading, and even long-term investing: At first glance, the ZigZag indicator doesn’t look like much. It is one of the more basic crypto trading indicators that follows price action. However, how you set the depth and deviation determines how strong the trend identification results are. Here are some of the crypto trading strategies that you can execute using the ZigZag indicator, along with the price action, histogram analysis, candlestick patterns, and a few other elements. The idea is simple. Once you apply the ZigZag indicator to the price action, you should look for lower highs during an uptrend and higher lows during a downtrend to identify a possible trend reversal. A historical validation of this strategy surfaced in December 2017, when BTC reached a high of almost $20,000. From that, it dipped all the way to $6000, showcasing significant market volatility. The subsequent swing high and the next swing low formed lower. This suggested a weakening trend and by December 2018, the price of Bitcoin dipped to almost $3000. The ZigZag indicator helps you locate the historical support and resistance levels. Notice how, in the case of BTC, the low made in December 2018 acted as a significant support level, which was respected during other downturns and corrective phases. Also, the prices surged in 2019 all the way up to $14,000 once Bitcoin managed to breach past the crucial resistance levels posed by all the lower high formations in 2018. If you are a trader interested in taking long positions, the ZigZag indicator can help you locate these key levels. Once these key levels are in, you can use them to place stop loss or even take profit orders, per your preferences. The ZigZag Indicator is at the very foundation of the Elliot Wave strategy. If you carefully observe any Elliot Wave pattern, say 1-2-3-4-5, you can see that the waves best align with the ZigZags. Plus, the corrective wave after the 1-5 impulse wave — the A-B-C wave — can also be sourced from the ZigZag indicator as part of the trend identification. Simply put, the ZigZag indicator helps visualize the Elliot Waves better. But then, to use this strategy, you need to understand the conditions/guidelines associated with Elliot Wave formation: Do note that these rules and guidelines aren’t set in stone. Under actual market conditions, there is room for some variation. With the Elliot Wave theory in place, you can even use volume analysis to place buy orders. You can combine the ZigZag swings with Fibonacci levels to locate additional support and resistance levels. The usage is simple — you need first to locate a swing high and then the swing low. Once done, you can connect the levels using the Fib indicator, giving you the possible support levels. Traders can use these support levels to look for breaches, rebounds, and ideal buying levels. Above is a BTC chart featuring the Fib retracement indicator connecting the swing high of $72,797 and the swing low of $59,600. Notice how the Fib indicator revealed a support level of $66838 at 61.8% of the indicator. A breach past this level, followed by a rebound and another breach, would have confirmed a positive move for Bitcoin. Instead, the price action couldn’t cross, nullifying any possible buying opportunity. ZigZag indicators are primarily straight lines. Therefore, you can use them to identify classical chart patterns like double tops, head and shoulders, triangles, and more. Below is a quick chart showing the double top formation at closer to $72,000 both times. This showed BTC bulls lacked strength, leading to a sizable price correction. ZigZag indicators can be used to work with momentum indicators and oscillators to help locate trading divergence. If you see that the bottom of the indicator, or the swing low of the ZigZag, coincides with an RSI peak, you might expect the prices to surge and vice versa. The same holds even when you are using the likes of the Gator Oscillator. Here are the key signals you need to look for while using the ZigZag indicator with the TradingView Gator Oscillator. #Bitcoin – $57,500 should be the bottom or its over ? On the weekly chart, the price is trading below the weekly support zone of $60,000. I see a lot of people calling for $50,000. The problem with this is if the price closes below the blue box, it would make the price action… pic.twitter.com/CQ9M9rNDC3 In addition to the mentioned strategies, you can look for key candlestick formations at the swing highs and swing lows to track potential reversals. Above is a quick example of it showing a “Bullish Harami” candlestick formation coinciding with the swing low for BTC at almost $65,000. The price moved to almost $73,000 within a few trading sessions. Note that besides these trading indicators, you must also rely on project fundamentals. “Fundamentals I’m talking about are quant measures of demand/supply. Anything that’s not TA on a price chart. These can be short timeframes. Includes – order book auction – futures demand via funding – flows into exchanges – open interest – on-chain liquidity shifts” The ZigZag indicator is one of the more reliable crypto trading indicators around. It fixes minor price fluctuations to accurately represent swing highs and lows, making it a powerful tool against the crypto market volatility. Furthermore, it works with most trading oscillators and chart analysis tools across multiple timeframes, making it one of the more flexible crypto trading resources. Overall, ZigZag is relatively accurate and offers bankable signals, making it a useful tool for traders operating in decentralized asset markets. To trade using the ZigZag indicator, you first need to adjust the settings based on your trading preferences, which will then help you smooth out the price action and locate the accurately identified swing highs and lows. Once done, you can apply the indicator for trend identification, getting hold of the bullish and bearish signals. Besides that, this indicator can even help you locate trading signals by presenting the right and usable patterns. The ZigZag trading algorithm represents a systematic method where the indicator is used to identify pivotal price movements. The algorithm works in the backend and filters the price moves, identifies the price reversals, and eventually helps with chart analysis and devise a handful of crypto trading strategies. Even though there is no perfect indicator setting for ZigZag, a good way forward is to go with a 5% deviation and a depth number of 12. These settings work well for day trading and even swing trading amid the crypto market volatility. Options trading is all about determining the buying and selling pressure across the concerned crypto counter. This is why the RSI indicator can be a good tool followed by the likes of Gator Oscillator. On TradingView Gator Oscillator, RSI and price action can be implemented at once to locate the right trading signals. Well, no single indicator can claim to be the most accurate. However, the MACD or Moving Average Convergence Divergence is known to offer clear cut trading signals via histogram analysis.

24::https://blockworks.co/news/blockchain-better-middlemen-swift::Blockworks::article::Blockchain really is better than middlemen::Opinion: The SWIFT system's forays into blockchain hint that one day the technology can replace intermediaries.::SWIFT’s forays into blockchain hint that one day the tech can replace intermediaries Soumyabrata Roy/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks The need for an organization connecting all banks is clear in today’s hyper-globalized economy where funds, goods and services are sent across every corner of the globe. So as globalization expanded, our deeply interconnected and centralized financial system triggered the development of SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) in 1973, a member-owned messaging network for financial institutions to send secure communications as well as verify and settle inter-bank transactions. SWIFT connects more than 11 thousand financial institutions across 200 countries and territories — long serving as a unified and stable institution amid a complex and volatile world order. But recently, the exclusion of many sanctioned Iranian and Russian banks from SWIFT prompted China and other nations to launch competing alternative intermediaries. This has led to the wide-scale rethinking of how to structure international finance. While barring certain institutions from SWIFT due to connections with state-sponsored violence, terror or other criminal activity is appropriate, fractionalizing centralized entities into siloed, competing groups poses a long-term threat to global finance. Changing attitudes toward centralized finance and innovative fintech applications further undermine the current financial system and highlight its shortcomings. Meanwhile, the rise of blockchain-based trading solutions has led those in the traditional financial sector to question the role of intermediaries. There is a growing consideration into how this technology can enhance the speed and frequency of interbank transactions. After all, the primary goal of Bitcoin and the broader crypto movement was to eliminate what seemed to be an unjust financial order. This order, dominated by large banks and financial institutions, wielded censorship and control over the world’s population, particularly in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Despite being largely opposed to crypto and blockchain until only a few years ago, financial institutions are now embracing blockchain as a technology, crypto as an investment opportunity and DeFi as a sandbox for innovative financial products. Read more from our opinion section: Bitcoin ETFs in conservative portfolios is good for crypto — and Wall Street This recognition of blockchain’s upside showcases its capability and effectiveness at removing the middleman. Further validating this were recent announcements that SWIFT, in collaboration with more than 12 major financial institutions, is experimenting with interoperable on-chain token transfers and tokenization. Together with SWIFT’s messaging technology, Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) and a public Ethereum testnet are facilitating the routing of messages between legacy banking systems. This alone should legitimize the idea that digital assets and blockchains are legitimate infrastructure components that banks should and will adopt. But it’s not totally clear where this adoption could go from here, as SWIFT’s use of CCIP simply gives an intermediary a new capability in the form of blockchain. It’s widely acknowledged that blockchain technology has the potential to significantly enhance the financial industry’s efficiency by diminishing its reliance on intermediaries. But this current practicality is hindered by the intricate nature of reforming a deeply entrenched, centuries-old system. Rather than pursuing an immediate overhaul, the emphasis should instead shift towards making gradual strides in reducing dependence on these financial intermediaries. The path to replacing intermediaries with blockchain technology necessitates the development of use cases, along with achieving interoperability among various blockchains and traditional banking systems. This requires not only demonstrating the blockchain’s technological benefits — notably its security and cost-effectiveness — in an enterprise setting, but also facilitating interoperability between dozens of unconnected blockchain networks. As siloes of data by design, blockchains are unable to share data or transfer assets among each other. Common mechanisms to boost blockchain interoperability including bridges, sidechains and cross-chain platforms all come with their fair share of complexities, security vulnerabilities and potential compliance challenges. Ensuring limited interoperability and relying on susceptible smart contracts to link diverse blockchain networks pose significant barriers to embracing the technology for financial transactions. The prospect of all financial institutions unanimously adopting the same blockchain network seems unlikely, given the decades-long history of technological infrastructure adoption. Consequently, the necessity for intermediaries, exemplified by the establishment of SWIFT for facilitating cross-bank transactions, becomes evident. But that means the fintech industry, which sits squarely between the finance and blockchain worlds, must develop solutions and protocols to link these isolated data silos. A SWIFT report from August 2023 stated that “firms prefer to leverage their existing infrastructure, manage implementations and proven business processes to connect to blockchain ledgers, where tokens are recorded in a way that is both compliant and secure.” Since financial institutions, understandably, don’t want to abandon their existing infrastructure, the key is to integrate new technologies between systems that use various blockchains. Efficient, loosely coupled integrations among entities and the establishment of a “trusted network” to facilitate the secure exchange of value and data can enable institutions to engage in affordable and convenient transfers. Atomic-swap transactions play a significant role in ensuring that transactions occur smoothly and without errors, especially when dealing with different blockchains and older legacy systems. They help maintain consistency and reliability throughout the transaction lifecycle. Moreover, they also contribute to enhancing overall asset transfer security, especially against threats like unauthorized access attempts and manipulation of data. They do this by establishing a secure communication network that supports essential operations like authentication and encryption. This means that the information and transactions within the system are better protected from potential risks. It’s unlikely that SWIFT’s dominance over the transfer of financial information and messages will be broken soon, but its research into interoperable blockchains and tokenization provides major hope toward reducing the inefficiencies caused by intermediaries — such as delays in transactions, additional costs and fees, dependency risks, lack of transparency and compliance challenges. Recognizing SWIFT as a legitimate and necessary financial institution while building the necessary infrastructure to do what it does but more efficiently, affordably and securely provides the best short-term path toward a future free from middlemen. Regardless of what comes from SWIFT’s experiments with blockchain, institutional adoption of blockchain technology will continue to grow as 97% of institutional investors believe tokenization will revolutionize asset management. Meeting this demand and bridging these two disconnected ecosystems can only be done through interoperability and automation, which can do what intermediaries do but cheaper and faster.

25::https://coinatory.com/cryptocurrency-news/worldcoin-foundation-unveils-new-open-source-biometric-security-system-19081/::Coinatory::article::Worldcoin Foundation Unveils New Open-Source Biometric Security System::Explore how Worldcoin Foundation is setting new benchmarks in data security with its innovative open-source biometric system, designed to enhance protection and address global regulatory concerns.::The Worldcoin Foundation has recently launched an innovative open-source system, aimed at bolstering the security of sensitive data, including biometric information. This strategic initiative emerges at a time when digital security is under intense scrutiny, particularly concerning the handling of personal and biometric data. The newly introduced system is designed to enhance data security through the use of Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC), a method that protects data by dispersing it across multiple locations. Hosted on Github, this system exemplifies the Foundation’s commitment to transparency and community-driven development. As detailed in the Foundation’s blog, this advanced SMPC technology splits a single secret into several parts, distributing these amongst various stakeholders to fortify protection. This method is particularly crucial for safeguarding biometric data collected during user registration for the Worldcoin (WLD) project through Orb devices. These devices, pivotal in the registration process, perform iris scanning to verify identities and facilitate the distribution of WLD tokens. In a significant move towards enhanced data privacy, the Worldcoin Foundation has also transitioned to this new system, simultaneously erasing old iris codes that were accumulated previously. This step not only elevates the standard of data protection but also aligns with global best practices amidst growing regulatory scrutiny over data collection methods. The collaboration with TACEO and Tools for Humanity has been instrumental in overcoming the scalability and cost barriers associated with SMPC technology. Tools for Humanity, co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, has been at the forefront of developing this project, taking significant measures to alleviate concerns surrounding its data handling practices. This development is timely as demands for biometric verification are increasing across various sectors. With its new system, the Worldcoin Foundation is leading the way in setting higher standards for data security and addressing the critical needs of digital identity verification in today’s interconnected world. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

26::https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-etf-daily-inflows/::Crypto Briefing::article::Bitcoin ETF snapshot: Grayscale Bitcoin Trust records new gains, Fidelity leads daily Bitcoin ETF inflows::Fidelity's Bitcoin ETF led with $99 million in today's inflows.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article In Monday’s trading session, Grayscale’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), saw $3.9 million in net inflows, according to data from Farside Investors. Leading the charge, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) reported substantial inflows of around $99 million, surpassing BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which saw inflows of around $21.5 million. This is not the first instance of Fidelity outperforming BlackRock in daily Bitcoin ETF inflows. The most significant difference was observed last Friday, with FBTC’s inflows exceeding $102 million compared to IBIT’s $13 million. But the spotlight is on GBTC. Last Friday, for the first time since conversion, the fund attracted $63 million in inflows, ending its prolonged outflow streak. Despite the influx, Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, expressed skepticism regarding its sustainability. “It’s difficult to discern what might be behind the flows into GBTC,” Geraci commented. “ETF buyers are an extremely diverse group with varying motivations. That said, I would be surprised if the inflows become a trend.” The high fee of 1.5% charged by GBTC has been cited as a reason for the fund’s asset outflow. The rate is notably higher than its ten competitors in the US market. Additionally, the liquidation of holdings by bankrupt lender Genesis has contributed to the decline in GBTC’s assets. Nevertheless, Grayscale maintains the lead in assets under management within the category, with GBTC managing approximately $17.4 billion, while IBIT is a close second at about $15.4 billion. Overall, US spot Bitcoin ETFs enjoyed a day of net inflows, totaling $217 million. Despite the positive movement in spot Bitcoin ETFs, Bitcoin’s price did not exhibit a corresponding increase. Historically, Bitcoin prices have risen with significant ETF inflows. However, at the time of reporting, Bitcoin’s price hovered around $63,400, showing a 1.5% decrease over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko.

27::https://theconversation.com/blockchain-based-property-registries-may-help-lift-poor-people-out-of-poverty-98796::The Conversation::article::Blockchain-based property registries may help lift poor people out of poverty::Without secure records of property ownership, many poor people around the world have trouble improving their economic situations. Several countries are already trying blockchain-based land registries.::Many developing countries don’t have a working system of tracking property rights, and what they do have can be fragile and incomplete. In Haiti, for instance, a large earthquake in 2010 destroyed all the municipal buildings that stored documents confirming many small farmers’ ownership of the land they worked. Even years later, many farmers didn’t have proof that they were landowners. People are still fighting over their land. This sort of problem – caused by natural disasters or not – is widespread, causing financial hardship for families in the developing world. Without an official, enforceable legal title to their property, people can’t resolve disputes over who can use which land for what – like who can farm where. They also can’t borrow against their existing assets to invest in their homes, businesses or communities. The value of those properties, and the lost economic opportunities for owners of assets without formal documentation, has been estimated at US$20 trillion worldwide. From researching blockchains and cryptocurrencies for the past three years, I have become convinced that these technologies have the potential to fight root causes of poverty – including by securely recording property ownership. I’m far from alone: Blockchain-based land registries have started up in Bermuda, Brazil, Georgia, Ghana, Honduras, India, Russia and Rwanda. The problems these efforts are addressing are significant. Across the world, land registries are inefficient and unreliable – or even downright corrupt. In Honduras, some government officials altered the country’s land ownership database, stealing property for themselves – including beachfront getaways. In many African countries, more than 90 percent of rural land is not registered. In Ghana, 78 percent of land is unregistered, and the country’s courts have a long backlog of land dispute cases. In India, millions of rural families lack legal ownership of the land they live and work on. The lack of secure land ownership is a bigger cause of poverty in the country than the caste system or a high illiteracy rate. Brazil has no single centralized land registry. Instead, about 3,400 private agents – called “cartorios” – register and check land ownership. The system is confusing, with many different documents created in different historical periods. Most land documents lack specific geographic references on property boundaries. Little wonder, then, that the system is plagued by corruption and double allocations – two formal documents each saying someone else owns a piece of land. These fragile and incomplete property rights systems in the developing world can affect the entire planet. In Brazil’s Amazon rainforest, illicit land grabbers forge deeds and use violence and bribery to falsely claim ownership of property, often under fake names, which the locals call “fantasmas,” or “ghosts.” Then they clear-cut the rainforest, which has serious environmental effects. Having “improved” the land by converting it to pasture, these land thieves then are eligible to register as the formal owners of the land they stole. This cycle has repeated for years, contributing to widespread Amazon deforestation. Using a blockchain system to record transactions could help solve these problems. A blockchain is a secure database that’s stored in a distributed – but connected – set of computers around the internet. It’s not susceptible to tampering, and every addition to the database must be digitally signed, making clear who’s changing what and when. So instead of a system with multiple conflicting documents, some of which may have been forged or altered, there’s only one record with a clear history of modifications, including who did what when. Blockchain transactions can include all kinds of information, including geographic boundaries or serial numbers and an owner’s identity. In Ghana, for instance, the nonprofit Bitland runs a blockchain-based land registry system with a written description of each parcel of land as well as GPS coordinates of boundary points and satellite photos of the area. A collaboration between a U.S.-based blockchain startup and a Brazilian real estate registry has created a record-keeping system for land in the southern coastal municipalities of Pelotas and Morro Redondo. Its blockchain database contains details like the property’s address, the owner’s name and contact information, zoning rules and a unique identification number for the property itself. Blockchain can provide other advantages too. For instance, when transferring land in the republic of Georgia, the buyer and the seller go to a public registry house and pay a fee between $50 and $200. Moving this process onto a blockchain could drop the costs to no more than 10 cents. Just starting a blockchain-based database isn’t enough to solve these problems, though. Data must be accurate when it’s entered, and records must include enough information to be authoritative about the properties they’re referring to. A new technological system won’t fix much in countries where it’s hard to determine the legitimate owner in the first place. Also, bureaucrats may object to new record-keeping systems that reduce their power, status and privileges. However, in places where governments or others who create the systems are viewed as fair and impartial and run a transparent process, blockchain-based land registry systems could give many of the world’s poorest people their first real asset. Once they have straightened out complex, corrupt and contradictory registry systems, people can safely invest in, borrow against and truly improve their properties, helping lift themselves out of poverty.::2018-06-28T10:36:30Z::Blockchain, Developing countries, Developing world, Emerging and developing markets, Global perspectives, Land ownership right, Land tenure, Property law, Property rights, Solutions Journalism::Nir Kshetri::Home::https://images.theconversation.com/files/224994/original/file-20180626-112607-lzp8td.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C828%2C5588%2C2794&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

And $48 Trillion in Wealth Just Got Access::The ETF-led bitcoin rally has stalled over the past three weeks, at least in part thanks to economic indicators pointing to higher than expected interest rates.::The U.S. jobs market continues to exhibit strength with the government reporting the addition of 303,000 jobs last month. That's the strongest headline number since May 2023 and easily topped economist forecasts for 200,000 and February's 270,000 additions (revised from a previously reported 275,000). The unemployment rate in March dipped to 3.8% against expectations for 3.9% and February's 3.9%. The price of bitcoin (BTC) fell about 0.5% in the minutes following Friday morning's report to $66,000. In traditional markets, U.S. stock index futures gave up a chunk of earlier gains, but are still modestly higher. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose 6.5 basis points to 4.38% and the dollar index added 0.5%. Coming into 2024, markets had priced in as many as five or six U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts to begin as soon as March. The economic data, however, hasn't cooperated. Inflation has actually risen somewhat in the first quarter of the year and job growth has remained robust. March has obviously come and gone with no rate cut and traders ahead of today's numbers had moved expectations of the first rate cut to June or July, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. A total of just three rate cuts are expected for the full year and even that could be too much. Speaking yesterday, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari suggested the possibility of no rate cuts at all in 2024. His remarks prompted a sharp reversal in stocks, with the major averages closing down more than 1%. Just following today's numbers, swaps trading indicated expectations for the first rate cut had moved out to September. Checking other report details, the labor force participation rate rose to 62.7% from 62.5%, suggesting sizable numbers of people returning to the workforce. Average hourly earnings rose 0.3% in March, in line with expectations and up from 0.2% in February. On a year-over-year basis, average hourly earnings rose an in line 4.1%, down from 4.3% in February.

As the market condition started to get exciting with several cryptos registering green, Cardano [ADA] also didn’t disappoint. In fact, ADA bulls entered the market as the token’s price broke above a critical resistance zone, hinting at a massive bull rally ahead. CoinMarketCap’s data revealed that Cardano’s price had increased by more than 8% in the last seven days, as it gained bullish momentum on the 15th of May.  At the time of writing, the token was trading at $0.4848 with a market capitalization of over $17.29 billion, making it the 10th largest crypto. However, the recent price pump wasn’t enough to allow the majority of ADA investors to earn profits. As per our look at IntoTheBlock’s data, over 58% of ADA investors were out of money. But this scenario might change soon as ADA broke above a bullish pattern. World of Charts, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet highlighting that ADA’s price broke above a bullish flag pattern that formed on its 8-hour chart. As per the tweet, ADA was almost running on 10% profit, and the pump could allow the token’s price to surge by 100%. If that happens, then investors might witness Cardano touching $1 in the coming weeks. The $1 target might be pretty ambitious in the short term. Therefore, AMBCrypto assessed ADA’s metrics to find where it is headed this week. As per our analysis of Santiment’s data, ADA’s MVRV ratio improved, which can be inferred as a bullish indicator. Its trading volume also remained high while its price surged, acting as a foundation for the bull rally. However, Cardano’s velocity dropped last week. This meant that ADA was used less often in transactions within a set timeframe. Source: Santiment Most market indicators also hinted at a continued price uptick. For instance, ADA’s price remained above its 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). The MACD displayed a clear bullish advantage in the market. On top of that, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) registered a sharp uptick, indicating a further price hike. Source: TradingView Read Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction 2024-25 We then checked Hyblock Capital’s data to look for the target that ADA might reach by the end of this week. Our analysis revealed that Cardano would witness a massive hike in liquidation near the $0.492 mark. Since high liquidations often result in price corrections, ADA’s might hit that level before slowing down for a bit. However, if it manages to break above that, then its price might touch $0.5 or $0.528 this week.

To learn more on how we evaluate each piece of content, please proceed to our verification methodology page One of the dominant narratives in crypto in 2024 is around ETFs. But why do they matter, and what’s the significance of Hong Kong’s involvement? Find the answers to this and more in this Hong Kong spot crypto ETF deep dive. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are baskets of investments that are designed to mimic the performance of an index or sector. They are similar to mutual funds because they pool investors’ assets and use professional fund managers to invest the money. ETFs are bought and sold on an exchange like any other listed stock. ETFs can hold a variety of asset types, including: ETFs are typically considered low-risk investments because they are low-cost and hold a basket of securities or other assets, which is great for diversification. They also attempt to replicate the performance of a specific market. As a result, many ETFs own the same assets as the index they track. Institutional investors can create additional ETF shares or redeem them for a basket of the underlying assets. This procedure helps to match the ETF’s market price with its net asset value (NAV). If an ETF’s price differs from its NAV, traders can buy or sell the ETF while simultaneously holding opposing positions in the underlying assets or a linked derivative (e.g., futures or options). This arbitrage can help bridge the price gap, ensuring the ETF price closely reflects its intended index. It also enables traders to profit from market inefficiencies. Lastly, in the context of cryptocurrency and Bitcoin ETFs, ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin and crypto without the risk of actually holding the asset. ETF fund managers are subject to rigorous regulations on the custody of the underlying assets. Therefore, they are required to appoint a custodian to hold their underlying assets. The custodian is usually a reputable bank or financial institution. Did you know? Coinbase Custody secures the majority of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. Recently, three fund managers have launched six crypto ETFs in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong branches of mainland Chinese firms Harvest Global Investments, China Asset Management (CAM), and Bosera Asset Management issued the Bitcoin and Ether ETF funds. This move marks a significant development in Bitcoin and Hong Kong’s financial markets. Here’s why Hong Kong spot crypto ETFs matter to the crypto ecosystem. Many traders believed that due to a slew of converging events, with the Hong Kong ETFs being the culmination, the price of Bitcoin would pump tremendously on news of the approval. The start of this chain of events began in Q1 2024 when the U.S. Federal Reserve announced interest rate pauses and potential cuts. We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle and that if the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year. This is traditionally viewed as a bullish event by investors. In other words, many believe that when the U.S. Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, the prices of assets like Bitcoin or equities increase, which is good for investors worldwide. Additionally, with the debut of the U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs (another bullish event for Bitcoin), followed by the Bitcoin halving, prospects were generally optimistic regarding the positive performance of Bitcoin. In summary, many anticipated that the price of Bitcoin would pump because of: In fact, the price impact on BTC was much more tepid than many expected, with trading volumes initially looking lower than was anticipated. The leading crypto asset managed to reclaim $64,000 upon the news of Hong Kong spot ETF approval but has since dipped below $60,000 (accurate as of May. 3, 2024). Much hype around Hong Kong ETFs also centers around their proximity to Asian markets, particularly China — where cryptocurrency was banned in 2017. Note: Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region (SAR) sitting just on the border of China. It has its own judicial, legislative, and executive powers and a separate legal system. With a massive population of 1.4 billion (17.72% of the world’s population) and a transaction volume of $90 billion in just a single month in 2023 on Binance from Chinese traders, Hong Kong ETF inflows from mainland China could prove to be a significant value-add to Bitcoin’s performance. In total, Asia-based customer exchange volume exceeded 1 trillion dollars in March and April of 2024. Although this may not necessarily translate to ETF trading, it does make a significant case for Asia’s growing interest in crypto. As stated previously, Asia-based exchange crypto trading volume exceeded $1 trillion in late Q1 2024 and early Q2 2024. This overshadows North American markets, which sit between $100-$200 billion in monthly trading volume. As a result, many people believe Hong Kong ETFs will be serious competitors to U.S. markets. This comparison has much to do with the sentiments of how both markets view crypto. While Hong Kong is positioning itself to become a crypto hub, the U.S. has taken the opposite approach, levying a heavy-handed and oftentimes criticized enforcement towards crypto-related activities, businesses, and developers. Notably, the U.S. approved futures-based crypto ETFs before, and at the chagrin, of approving spot-based crypto ETFs. Many believe spot-based ETFs to be superior products to futures ETFs. This is due to roll costs and contango risks. As a result, the U.S. has been criticized for inadvertently putting customers at risk, while Hong Kong has been praised for its progressive policies towards crypto-based financial products. Moreover, while U.S. crypto ETFs have been relegated to cash redemptions, Hong Kong has opted to use in-kind redemptions, which are considered less complex and more cost-efficient than the latter. Despite the hype, the debut of Hong Kong crypto ETFs was relatively lukewarm. The U.S. ETFs achieved $4.6 billion in trading volume on their first day, while Hong Kong produced about $12 million in trading volume. However, this performance is more impressive when contextualized within the regional markets. https://t.co/CCZxCxVbeh Unlike the U.S., where daily trading volumes can reach $166 billion, Asia sees an average of only $20 billion. Specifically, the ChinaAMC Bitcoin ETF’s first-day intake of $123 million is impressive, ranking it 6th among the 82 ETFs launched in Hong Kong over the past three years. We just put out note with final data (which doesn't come in as fast as US). In short, HK saw $292m in assets on Day One (we predicted $1b in two years so way ahead of schedule but corrections can derail trajectories as we seeing in US). Ether ETFs grabbed 15% of pie and size… https://t.co/RT8SvMvEuA The U.S. Bitcoin ETF’s assets under management (AUM) reflect the United States’s status as the world’s financial center and may also reflect a preference for investors to trade ETFs in the U.S. rather than Hong Kong. As of May 3, 2024, the AUM of U.S. crypto ETFs is between $500 million and about $2.5 billion. On the one hand, the U.S. signifies a larger market for institutional players to trade. On the other, Hong Kong presents a more progressive haven for crypto investors. As of 2024, the U.S. has only approved Bitcoin ETFs, while Hong Kong has both Bitcoin and Ether ETFs. Although Asia dominates crypto trading volume, North America dominates ETF trading volume. Comparatively, the ETF markets in the U.S. and Hong Kong also differ in size, variety of offerings, trading behavior, and regulatory frameworks. With almost $50 billion in assets, Hong Kong has a comparatively small market size. Hong Kong’s ETF market has grown but is still smaller than the U.S. Moreover, ETF offerings in Hong Kong have traditionally focused more on Asian markets and specific regional investments. Everyone is saying the Hong Kong #Bitcoin ETFs flamed out, without understanding what actually happened and what the implications are. This is a second major portal to legacy money. A lot of it. Plan accordingly. https://t.co/Wsme7EPiU5 The U.S. ETF market is one of the largest in the world, with assets totaling almost $9 trillion. It offers a wide variety of ETFs, including those covering: Yes, also @EthereanMaximus: There are more assets in US Listed #Bitcoin ETFs than there are assets in EVERY single ETF listed in Hong Kong. Yes it could be a big deal down the line. But its a whole different animal. The US ETF Market is almost $9 Trillion in assets — that's… U.S. ETFs are also known for having a high degree of innovation. The U.S. market features a broad array of ETFs, including thematic ETFs, ESG (environmental, social, and governance) focused ETFs, leveraged and inverse ETFs, and more. In contrast, the focus in Hong Kong has traditionally been more on conventional assets and less on alternative or niche markets. However, recent years have seen an expansion into more specialized products, including those targeting mainland Chinese investors — although mainland China is currently restricted from trading Hong Kong Bitcoin and Ether ETFs. 2024 will go down as the year of crypto ETFs. Many countries are opening up to the idea of crypto-related financial products being a viable investment strategy. The U.S. kicked off the year by approving spot Bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 10, 2024. Despite historical skepticism towards cryptocurrencies, the approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. in January reflects a commendable shift towards embracing innovation. Following the U.S., Hong Kong was next in line to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs for trading. By the end of 2024, the ASX stock exchange in Australia is anticipated to list the first batch of spot bitcoin ETFs that have been approved. Although Australian investors have traded spot bitcoin ETFs on CBOE Australia since 2022, ASX is Australia’s leading equities exchange, handling most domestic trades. In March 2024. the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) of the U.K. announced that it would not object to requests for crypto asset-backed exchange-traded notes. Shortly thereafter, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) disclosed that it would accept applications for crypto ETNs, with a tentative listing date set for May 28, 2024, and only for institutional investors. Although the U.K. listing is a big win for crypto-related financial products, it is important to recognize the distinction between crypto ETFs vs. ETNs and how they differ from North American and Asian markets. European regulations, particularly those under UCITS, require investment funds to be diversified to reduce risk. ETFs can hold a variety of assets to achieve this diversification. However, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether are single assets, so creating a diversified fund solely focused on a single crypto asset is impossible within the UCITS framework. As a result, financial institutions have turned to alternative structures like Exchange-Traded Notes (ETNs) to provide exposure to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. ETNs are debt securities that track the performance of an underlying asset. In this way they are similar to ETFs, except ETNs do not require direct asset ownership. However, LSE-approved crypto ETNs are required to hold the underlying asset, unlike typical ETNs. The year 2024 is shaping up to be one of the most prolific for crypto developments, particularly in the area of institutional adoption. Whereas in previous cycles, success was characterized by massive startup valuations, froth, and huge profits, this cycle is categorized by a shift towards legitimacy and validation, as major players in finance embrace digital assets. The significance of Hong Kong spot crypto ETFs is most clearly that they are another step towards global recognition and integration of digital assets into traditional financial systems. Yes, on April 30, 2024, Hong Kong investors began trading six Bitcoin and Ether spot ETFs. They were sponsored by three prominent institutions from mainland China, Harvest Global Investments, China Asset Management (CAM), and Bosera Asset Management. Hong Kong has historically positioned itself as a hub for cryptocurrency. China banned cryptocurrency trading in 2021. The nation has a history of imposing bans and restrictions on cryptocurrencies. Although, at times China has reversed its policies, it has yet to change its latest ban. Exchange-traded funds are investment funds, traded on stock exchanges, mirroring the performance of an underlying index or asset. Likewise, exchange-traded notes are debt securities issued by financial institutions that track the performance of an underlying asset or index. The difference between the two is that ETFs typically hold the underlying asset, ETNs normally do not, but also typically expose investors to credit risk. There are many reasons why some would view Hong Kong ETFs as an important event. Many people hypothesized that the debut of Hong Kong ETFs, which followed the Bitcoin halving, would cause the price of Bitcoin to pump. Additionally, the ETFs could be viewed as a sign of mainstream adoption.

31::https://blockworks.co/news/blockchain-lost-decentralized-spirit::Blockworks::article::Blockchain has lost its decentralized spirit::Opinion: I often hear, “We will start out centralized, and we will become more decentralized later” — but this is nonsense!::Decentralization must be the cornerstone, not a mere aspiration, of blockchain’s journey Midjourney modified by Blockworks A narrative has taken root in the realm of blockchain technology, one that champions the gradual transition from centralized control to a decentralized future. Yet this story, often recited by those at the helm, overlooks a fundamental truth about power: Once seized, it is rarely surrendered without a struggle. This belief that a centralized beginning can smoothly transition to a decentralized ethos is more myth than reality, akin to convincing a child to relinquish their tight grasp on a coveted sweet. The intention here isn’t to cast venture capitalists or early stakeholders as adversaries — it’s to advocate for a balance, for fairness that underpins the very foundation of blockchain. I often hear, “We will start out centralized, and we will become more decentralized later.” But I believe this is nonsense! One of the hardest things to give up is power. This notion is vividly illustrated by the French Revolution, a historical event that epitomizes the struggle to redistribute power from an entrenched monarchy to a democratic governance structure. Despite the promise of liberty, equality and fraternity, the revolution faced immense resistance from those unwilling to cede control, leading to a turbulent period of conflict and transformation. This historical episode serves as a poignant reminder that once power is acquired, relinquishing it is a far more formidable challenge than many anticipate. As blockchain ventures flourish, the grip of those in control tightens, with early investors and builders basking in the success their influence has wrought. Conversely, during tumultuous times, these same figures embark on campaigns of reassurance, painting over cracks while strategically planning their exits. This stark duality reveals a profound flaw in the prevalent “centralize now, decentralize later” mantra, significantly underestimating the seductive allure of power and the inherent challenges in relinquishing it once established. The promise of distributed authority is at the heart of the blockchain revolution. The reimagining of governance where innovation serves not just the circulation of capital, but empowers and amplifies a multitude of voices (not just those traditionally heard in the corridors of wealth). Yet, a troubling reality overshadows this ideal: A staggering concentration of over 80% of blockchain assets in the hands of a mere 1% of wallets. Regardless of whether these assets make up projects that aim to fully decentralize or not, the fact of the matter is that early stakeholders and VCs often hold the largest piece of the pie for new blockchains simply because they come in first, when it’s riskiest. This imbalance transcends mere issues of fairness, striking at the very viability of blockchains as engines of innovation and inclusivity. It’s a travesty that the vast majority of value creation does not come from this 1%, underscoring a critical disconnect. Those who contribute the most to the ecosystem often have the least say in its direction and the smallest share in its success — those early VCs holding all the tokens do provide impact with their initial investments, but their participation usually stops there. And because the protocol’s governance is based on the ownership of the token, the new builders don’t have the weight to make major decisions by the major token holders. Read more from our opinion section: The worst kind of decentralization is none at all This stark discrepancy isn’t just unfair; it’s fundamentally counterproductive, eroding the incentive for innovators, developers and community members to pour their energy and creativity into the ecosystem. By sidelining the very individuals who are the lifeblood of innovation, blockchain ecosystems risk stagnating, as the centralized accumulation of benefits stifles the diverse input and collaboration essential for breakthroughs and resilience. Such a structure threatens the long-term sustainability and incentive for valuable contributors to remain engaged and invested in these projects. The long-term viability of blockchain technology depends on its ability to foster a genuinely inclusive environment where contributions are recognized and rewarded appropriately, ensuring that all participants have a stake in the ecosystem’s success. Where do we go from here? I believe that many of the first-generation blockchains, the foundational layers that have been the bedrock of the industry, have veered too far off course. Their structures have solidified around centralization to a point where a return to true decentralization might no longer be feasible. This isn’t to say they’re doomed for failure; far from it. The potential of blockchain technology is vast, its future inherently multichain, promising a landscape rich with diverse and interconnected networks. However, we need to start afresh if we want to harness this potential fully. This proposition might seem daunting, yet considering the broader timeline of technological evolution, we’re still in the nascent stages of blockchain development. The beauty of this space is its foundation in open source principles. Almost all blockchain technologies are open to being studied, modified and repurposed. This openness paves the way for new projects to emerge — i.e, reboots of existing chains, each carrying a distinct mission and fostering a unique culture. Embarking on this path isn’t merely about technological innovation; it’s about reimagining the ethos that guides blockchain development. By initiating new projects with decentralization as a core principle, we stand a chance to correct the course. This approach doesn’t merely replicate what came before, but builds upon it, learning from past missteps to create blockchains that are truly from the people, by the people and for the people. To visualize the potential paths of blockchain, consider two atomic reactions: fusion and fission. A blockchain driven by a diverse, invested community is akin to a fusion reactor. It’s efficient, sustainable and produces a continuous outflow of energy. This model represents a decentralized ecosystem where power and rewards are evenly spread, fostering innovation and participation from all stakeholders. The result is a robust and vibrant network, capable of long-term growth and adaptation. In contrast, a network dominated by a few mirrors the principles of a fission bomb: initially powerful, but ultimately leading to destruction. This reflects a centralized blockchain ecosystem, where concentrated power leads to rapid gains that are not sustainable over time. Such a structure can stifle innovation and lead to a fragile system, prone to collapse. This analogy underlines the crucial choice blockchain faces between sustainable growth and short-term gains, emphasizing the need for a decentralized approach to ensure the technology’s long-term viability and success. Decentralization must be the cornerstone, not a mere aspiration, of blockchain’s journey. It’s about democratizing power, fostering a community where everyone’s voice matters and every contribution is valued from the outset. At this pivotal juncture, the trajectory of blockchain hinges on our resolve to anchor it in decentralization from the very beginning. By prioritizing decentralization as our foundational principle, we chart a course toward a future where blockchain serves as a bedrock for equitable growth and democratic engagement. Let’s seize this opportunity to redefine the landscape, ensuring blockchain remains a tool for empowering the many, not just the few. In doing so, we not only realize the full potential of blockchain technology but also contribute to the creation of a fairer, more inclusive world. This is not just the path to technological innovation, but a step towards a more equitable and collaborative ecosystem. We are still early.

This surge in capital allocation aligns closely with a key uptick in Bitcoin’s value, affirming investor confidence in the cryptocurrency sector. Farside Investors reports that overall, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs saw $100.5 million in net inflows on May 14, indicating a robust week of investment activity. Conversely, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) experienced a net outflow of $50.9 million, contrasting sharply with the inflows seen in other funds. Notably, the ARKB ETF has consistently attracted substantial capital, with inflows surpassing the $100 million mark seven times previously. The fund reached its peak with a record $200.7 million inflow on March 27, and its most considerable outflow of $98.1 million occurred shortly afterward on May 1. Other funds like BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) have not mirrored this trend, with no new inflows for two consecutive days. Meanwhile, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) added $8.1 million in net inflows, bolstered by a strong performance the previous day with $38.6 million, leading the U.S. BTC ETF market. Additional smaller-scale inflows were noted in ETFs such as BTCO, EZBC, BRRR, and HODL, which reported $5.5 million, $1.8 million, $1.2 million, and $1.7 million respectively. The cumulative net inflows into the BTC ETF market are nearing a milestone, approaching $12 billion, currently standing at $11.84 billion. This growth trajectory coincides with Bitcoin’s recent price increase, which saw a 0.5% rise over the past 24 hours, with the cryptocurrency trading at $62,150. This data not only highlights the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency investment landscape but also signals a continued investor interest amid fluctuating market conditions. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

33::https://cryptobriefing.com/roaring-kitty-gme-comeback/::Crypto Briefing::article::Legendary trader Roaring Kitty posts comeback meme, Solana meme coin $GME soars 500%::Roaring Kitty has not posted anything on social media in three years.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Keith Gill, also known online as Roaring Kitty (also known by other pseudonyms such as DeepF*ckingValue), has posted a cryptic meme on X. Notably, this was Gill’s first post in roughly three years since the events surrounding the GameStop case and the shutdown of the WallStreetBets subreddit. pic.twitter.com/YgjVqtgcNS — Roaring Kitty (@TheRoaringKitty) May 13, 2024 The meme depicts a man leaning forward from a sitting position while holding what appears to be a smartphone. Notably, the meme has a red chair and a red arrow going right, indicating some sort of movement or directional change. Gill is largely credited for spiking the GameStop stock surge in late 2020. Gill worked as a financial analyst, became convinced that GameStop stock was undervalued and shared this belief on Twitter (now X) and YouTube using the handle RoaringKitty. In 2019, Gill purchased $53,000 worth of GameStop stock. As he continued posting about the stock on social media, more retail traders (everyday people who trade stocks) began buying GameStop, leading to a rapid rise in the stock price. When GameStop’s stock price peaked at $483 per share in January 2021, Gill’s investment was valued at nearly $48 million. Gill’s identity was revealed shortly after the GameStop stock surge by Reuters who identified him using public records. In February 2021, Gill testified to Congress about his role in the GameStop stock saga, stating that he thought the stock was “dramatically undervalued.” In September 2022 and 2023, Netflix and Sony Pictures released a docuseries and a movie titled “Eat the Rich: The GameStop Saga” and “Dumb Money,” respectively, which spotlighted Gill’s journey. A Solana memecoin ($GME) made to commemorate the events surrounding the GameStop controversy suddenly surged $510.9% just over eight hours since Gill’s X post. “The $GME memecoin pays homage to the GameStop saga anniversary, showing we can stand up to the big guys together,” states the token’s official website. According to data from CoinGecko, the token’s price has been largely inactive since its creation in late January. It remains unclear whether Gill has any connection with the token.

34::https://theconversation.com/after-bitcoin-are-you-ready-for-the-next-generation-of-cryptocurrencies-37927::The Conversation::article::After Bitcoin, are you ready for the next generation of cryptocurrencies?::With the Bank of England mooting the idea it might get involved with digital currencies, you might think it was good news for Bitcoin.::The Bank of England believes that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin could be big news and even UK chancellor George Osborne is tweeting about it. But it is important to note the detail in the central bank’s comments. It is talking about forming its own digital currencies in a trend which could yet see Bitcoin take a back seat in the future it helped to create. At a recent meeting of the Social Media Leadership Forum in London on the theme of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, we watched a short film that portrays Bitcoin as a kind of moral alternative to traditional banks. Not only is Bitcoin the new, cool choice of Generation Z, but it is also a way to render third party profiteering from financial transactions irrelevant. Bitcoin is the answer! Bitcoin is the future. Bitcoin is the best way of transferring value digitally without a third party. No pal needed to pay … There was a straw poll in the audience. Who, of these leaders of (mostly) large corporations in the UK, had any direct experience of Bitcoin? Three hands went up – and they belonged to three young terrier-like Bitcoin entrepreneurs who chatted freely and articulately about their wares and painted the Bitcoin story as a huge, unstoppable business opportunity. Two contrasting views emerged at that meeting. One is of Bitcoin as a kind of moral revolution, setting us free from corporate greed, interference and snooping. The other is a more prosaic view, of Bitcoin as a new means of making money in a leaner and smarter way. (There is also a subsidiary view of course: of a below-the-radar gambling den, a shadow money-changing table for the Dark Web) The unscientific poll in that meeting room would appear to support findings elsewhere. One online survey found that only 8% of US retailers were planning to accept Bitcoin within the next 12 months. None was currently accepting Bitcoin. Another survey found 65% of people polled were not at all familiar with Bitcoin. Of those that were even slightly familiar, 80% had never used it before. There has been a significant decline in the value of bitcoins, and questions have been raised about whether 2015 is Bitcoin’s make or break year. Whatever the prophets of doom say, there remain bullish young entrepreneurs, buoyed by the recent announcement that Dell will be the first major retailer to accept Bitcoin, as well as a survey that suggests lower income populations may well embrace it. The Bank of England is understandably circumspect about the feasibility and advantages of creating its own digital currency, but the simple fact of the discussion adds to the feeling that Bitcoin may be the “first draft” of something with broader application. Digital value doesn’t only have to mean money and the popular view of Bitcoin might just emphasise the “coin” a little too much. At the meeting in London much discussion centred around the “blockchain”. This public ledger of all Bitcoin transactions effectively creates continuity for Bitcoin users, a context in which the currency can exist. According to technology writer Nozomi Hayase: So, let’s say that Bitcoin is a good example of decentralisation and people power, but it is only a first example, and we will move on to using and innovating the underlying technology. It is no longer about cryptocurrencies really but about the potential of third party-free transfer. That can involve entirely different cultural interactions than just seeing value as meaning money. For example, we could see voting and collective decison-making without the use of third-party control. The future can involve all kinds of creative exchange between human (and even digital) beings that are direct, private when wanted, and totally in the hands of sender and receiver. You might enact your will without lawyers. You might even ensure your driverless car isn’t mediated by Google but is just a direct relationship between you and the vehicle’s operating system. We will transfer all kinds of digital value and assets without third party control. Our artistic creations: our music, our digital art. With the advent of drones, even physical things. One of the issues that Bitcoin has is its split personality. It is touted as a place of personal empowerment and direct, honest transacting that is private and yet also potentially seedy and criminal. It is billed as a moral reaction to greedy banks that, at the same time, offers ways to gamble in a money market not dissimilar in terms of underpinning ethics. It suggests freedom from governance even as that very lack of governance may throw up all kinds of social problems. That puts our choice of future at a crossroads. For, even as we cut a direct channel from sender to receiver, between sharers of different kinds of meaning and value, we also potentially cut out the moral force that third parties have usefully played. Most users of Bitcoin are shocked to discover that if they are scammed into sending Bitcoins to a fake web site, their money is gone for good, with no way of getting it back. Currently, there’s redress in the realm of conventional banking. If insurers spring up in the Bitcoin arena with hundred dollar excesses, aren’t we heading back into the realm of third party involvement again anyway? And if central banks start issuing their own digital currencies? Yet the opportunity is there to take Bitcoin away from a collusion of mediocrity around money metaphors and evolve into genuinely new and exciting ways to allow the sharing of value in ways that empower individuals, regardless of income. As Hayase, also points out: “Bitcoin makes possible open source governance. The power to decide the course of one’s own destiny is now in the hands of ordinary people.” That huge claim implies the way crypto-value exchange is viewed and deployed is going to change significantly. Without third party governance, we will have to build ethical awareness and behaviour into new versions of the platform, and also research and educate ourselves in the new moral challenges and risks associated with it. The technology promises much, but the whole thing may end up parked in wiring cash and simply buying and selling more stuff online. Yet it could be so much more. Blockchain technology could underpin the internet of things, safeguarding our privacy, reducing cost, and ensuring the next wave of change in the digital realm puts real control in the hands of people, not corporations. Whether it does will depend not on enthusiastic Bitcoin entrepreneurs, or opportunistic corporations like Dell, but on the users. You and me. And maybe the odd central bank.::2015-02-26T14:46:15Z::Bank of England, Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, Finance, George Osborne::Paul Levy::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/73055/original/image-20150225-1780-1y9qqh7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

The options market shows investors are taking the hint. A death cross occurs when a short-term moving average drops below the long-term moving average, signaling a potential long-term bearish shift in momentum. The ratio's 50-week simple moving average (SMA) appears on track to cross below the 200-week SMA, according to charting platform TradingView. The impending death cross signals risk aversion or prolonged underperformance of ether (ETH) and other altcoins relative to bitcoin (BTC). Since 2017, the crypto market has oscillated between bitcoin-led regimes and altcoin-led regimes. More importantly, altcoin leadership has been characterized by a rising ETH/BTC ratio. In other words, traders are willing to take more risk when ether is outperforming bitcoin and vice versa. The ETH/BTC ratio has dropped nearly 10% to 0.048 this year, TradingView data show . "The ETHBTC cross is testing a critical support level after breaking below 0.05," Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a market note Friday. "There has been a persistent large selling of ETH calls which has crushed [volatility] and also put some downside pressure on price. Could this again be a very early signal of [bullish] FOMO turning into fear in ETH as a proxy for alts." The way bitcoin and ether options are currently priced on Deribit, the leading derivatives exchange, also points to expectations for ether underperformance in the near term. At press time, ether puts expiring in seven days, one and two months traded at premiums of 5%, 3% and 0.3%, respectively, to calls. A put option gives the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. A call option gives the right to buy, so the premium for puts – which provide protection against a price decline – indicates a bearish outlook. In bitcoin's case, the bias was for calls across maturities, excluding seven-day options. Edited by Sheldon Reback.

Bitcoin [BTC], the leading cryptocurrency, is beginning to recover from a week-long slump, currently valued at $67,093 with a 1.28% increase in the past 24 hours. Additionally, on the 17th of May, Farside Investors reported that Grayscale’s spot Bitcoin ETF (GBTC) saw inflows of $31.6 million, and GBTC now oversaw more than $18 billion in assets. Source: Farside Investors Well, Grayscale has faced major challenges since converting from a trust to a spot ETF in January. However, three consecutive days of inflows have been a boon for GBTC.  Seeing a positive outlook of GBTC among investors, an X (formerly Twitter) user, @osf_rekt said, Source: OSF/X This transition has resulted in over $17 billion in withdrawals, largely due to higher fees than other options. Additionally, a series of bankruptcies within the crypto industry over the last two years compelled companies to withdraw funds to meet creditor obligations. Interestingly, on the 15th of May, all spot Bitcoin ETFs, apart from BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), reported inflows. Simultaneously, on a similar day, Grayscale’s GBTC notably recorded its first inflows in a week, drawing in $27 million. This highlights that institutional investors are showing interest in Bitcoin, bringing liquidity, while crypto whales remain less enthusiastic. Data from Santiment, analyzed by AMBCrypto, indicate that while whales slowed accumulation, retail investors are increasing, promoting network decentralization. Source: Santiment This trend of retail accumulation could benefit Bitcoin in the long run by promoting greater network decentralization. Highlighting May’s positivity for spot Bitcoin ETFs, Eric Balchunas, Senior Analyst at Bloomberg, noted, “The bitcoin ETFs have put together a solid two weeks with $1.3b in inflows, which offsets the entirety of the negative flows in April- putting them back around high water mark of +$12.3b net since launch. This key number IMO bc it nets out inflows and outflows (which are normal).” Source: Eric Balchunas/X Offering advice to investors, he further commented, “Last two mos show why best not to get emotional over flows which come in and out, part of ETF life, but a) i think they’ll net out positive long-term b) the flow amts on either side are small relative to aum maybe (1-2%) so it’s never SO OVER or SO BACK if you think about it.”   Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

38::https://blockworks.co/news/what-is-fully-homomorphic-encryption::Blockworks::article::What is fully homomorphic encryption and how will it change blockchain?::Fully homomorphic encryption differs from zero-knowledge tech, as it can compute on top of encrypted data without revealing data points.::FHE differs from zero-knowledge technology, as it can perform computation on top of encrypted data without revealing data points Artwork by Crystal Le In today’s digital world, the need to decrypt data for computational tasks exposes it to security risks. This is a significant problem in privacy-sensitive sectors like Web3, where decentralized applications and finance at times rely on both confidentiality and integrity in data processing to maintain trust and security on chain. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) offers a potential solution by enabling the processing of encrypted data without needing to decrypt it first, thus preserving confidentiality. This advancement not only enhances data security and privacy, but also extends the potential for secure data analysis and decentralized services. Guy Itzhaki, CEO and co-founder of Fhenix, says that in the context of blockchain, FHE enables developers and users to control which assets they want to maintain privately and confidentially on-chain. This means that it will enable developers to “create a new set of use cases,” and “unlock the way for true on-chain gaming, voting, and auctions,” Itzahki said. Read more: Encryption startup Fhenix raises $7M for private computation Although there are some similarities between FHE and zero-knowledge (zk) technology, the major difference is that FHE technology can perform computation on top of encrypted data without having to reveal or know the data points to obtain the end result. Liam McDonald, head of growth at blockchain privacy startup Fairblock, explained that with zk technology, a prover turns necessary data into a secure code called a polynomial commitment to show it’s accurate. “In order to do this, the data itself is turned into polynomial hashes and is aggregated into a polynomial equation of the hashes that represents the encoded data,” McDonald told Blockworks. This equation is then sent to a verifier, who determines whether the function is true. If the function is proven, a proof is generated, confirming that the information inside is accurate. Peyman Momeni, co-founder of Fairblock, mentioned that while zk proofs allow users to validate ownership of data or correct computation, they fall short in supporting computations on encrypted data, especially when it involves merging private information from multiple users. “Zk is more relevant for scalability with some degree of security and limited privacy applications like shielded transfers, where FHE unlocks wide range of applications coupled with higher levels of data security and privacy,” Momeni said. When combined with the benefits of the blockchain, FHE provides enhanced privacy, which is a core component that is missing in the existing blockchain ecosystem, said Kaal Dhairya, a Shiba Inu developer. “Apart from true end-to-end encryption of data, this opens up a variety of use cases, including supply chain/food chain to blockchain, private voting for DAOs, efficient prediction markets, on-chain casino games, hidden items in on-chain games, and many more,” Dhairya said. Momeni notes that in most crypto use cases, it is necessary to combine private inputs from multiple users, compute over them and decrypt the results, meaning that there would be a “shared private state.” “As an example in private governance or sealed-bid auctions, all users encrypt their votes or bids, we perform on-chain computing over encrypted data, then in the end we need to decrypt the actual results,” he said. “In this case we don’t actually decrypt the individual bids/votes/trades, just the updated state or the result of computation.” Read more: Fully homomorphic encryption rollups are one step closer to reality To ensure no single user has exclusive access, a system of multiple validators should share this decryption key, and decrypt the information collaboratively at the appropriate time. According to Momeni, current FHE technologies face the technical hurdle of creating a decentralized system for managing these decryption keys. Fairblock, however, is developing a solution with a decentralized network for key generation, aiming to make FHE technology more accessible and practical for developers and various platforms. It’s worth noting that FHE isn’t the only privacy solution being developed on the blockchain today; there are several other solutions that might be more beneficial for developers building different tools. “There are different solutions with different trade-offs, so we’re trying to enable developers to use them correctly without passing a cryptography course,” Momeni said. Read more from our opinion section: Privacy is going mainstream In the case of Fairblock, the company sees itself as being similar to Axelar, Eigenlayer, or Celestia, where a network facilitates and accelerates other builders. “Instead of cross-chain messaging, shared security, and data availability, we’re abstracting away all of the bandwidth overhead, onboarding and maintenance costs of running the network in a secure and decentralized way,” he said. The company recently rolled out its public testnet, which is designed for developers of select layer-2 networks to tailor how they integrate encryption and decryption into applications. It currently enables users to leverage identity-based encryption (IBE), witness encryption (WE) with integration of fully homomorphic encryption still under development.

40::https://cryptobriefing.com/meme-coin-surge-analysis/::Crypto Briefing::article::GameStop Wif Hat meme coin skyrockets 47,000%, then plummets::After a massive leap in less than 24 hours, the GMEWIFHAT token price showed a slump. Cat coins hypercycle?::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Solana meme coin GameStop Wif Hat (GMEWIFHAT) showed stellar growth this Tuesday, with its price surpassing 40,000%. However, at the time of writing, the upside for GMEWIFHAT is just 131%.  The price increase is tied to the return of RoaringKitty, the trader largely credited for spiking the GameStop stock surge in late 2020 along with the “WallStreetBets” subreddit, whose real identity is Keith Gill. Another meme coin that benefited from this fact is Roaring Kitty Wif Hat (RWIF), which currently bolsters a 32,424% rise.  Moreover, both meme coins borrow the “hat” factor that was made popular by the token Dogwifhat (WIF), which is the largest meme coin on Solana by market cap, conquered after a price leap of over 181,000%.  The X user known as EllioTrades shared with its over 750,000 followers his thesis on the meme coin market after the return of RoaringKitty. According to EllioTrades, the man behind the WallStreetBets episode shared that “the dog days are over” in one of the videos posted after his comeback.  “Now on the surface this may be seen as a simple announcement of his return (as a cat). Maybe the Dogs are actually referencing Wall Street elites. It really does not matter. Memes thrive on IYKYK style attention betting and the prominence of Roaring Kitty post “Dumb Money” movie hitting netflix is levels beyond anything we’ve seen before,” said EllioTrades.  Therefore, EllioTrades explained that he will add exposure to all cat-themed coins he currently holds. He also thinks that the market is yet to start its bull cycle, with more upward movement set to happen in the next months.  Moreover, the trader predicted that once the new generation of traders starts flowing to crypto from social platforms such as TikTok, memes that are popular among “Gen Z” will give life to the most profitable meme coins.  “The first real example I saw of this was $HAMMY (Sad Hamster) which I bought because my wife shows me that crying hamster literally all the time on TikTok. As the dumb money trade goes viral again, the next gen will bring over the “REAL” memes actually going viral on socials. They will shift the game to one where they have the upper hand, as any new group would attempt to do,” he concludes.

As predicted however, 2015 has seen the continued fall in value of the currency that was supposed to fuel the digital age. In the last 10 days alone, it has lost 26% in value. If 2014 was a bad year for the digital currency, 2015 looks like it will be even worse. Barely days into the year, UK-based Bitcoin exchange Bitstamp was “hacked” and 19,000 Bitcoin stolen. At the time, this loss was valued at US $5 million. Bitstamp has since come back online, with revamped security from BitGo. It may however, all be a bit too late. Hacks of Bitcoin exchanges have come to characterise the Bitcoin world. It isn’t something that is necessarily inherent in Bitcoin itself, but more of a feature of the types of companies that have sprung up around the troubled technology. At best, the hack of one-time leading Bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, was a result of sloppy coding and business practices. At worst, it was an inside job, defrauding its customers of $487 million. A more ominous problem has cast its shadow on the future of Bitcoin. Bitcoin relies on people to engage in “mining” to validate every exchange of the virtual currency. Miners, do some agreed calculations, and if they are fast, or lucky, enough, will succeed in winning some newly produced Bitcoin in exchange for adding the transaction onto the Bitcoin ledger called the Blockchain. The strategy of mining has become Bitcoin’s achilles’ heel. The design of Bitcoin dictates that the difficulty of mining will increase as more Bitcoins are produced and more miners get involved. This has led to mining being dominated by companies that can scale to the point where they can guarantee to earn a certain percentage of Bitcoins created each day. As Bitcoin’s value has dropped, the economics of the mining operation have changed, to the point that mining ceases to be economically viable. Cloud mining company CEX.io suspended their mining operations this week, declaring that it needed the price of Bitcoin to be at least $320 before it would be able to resume its operations. Unfortunately for them, the price has dropped even further since and the likelihood of it climbing back to $320 seems slim. Another mining company, CoinTerra, is being sued by a data centre provider for $5.4 million for unpaid fees. The cost of power alone to run CoinTerra’s services was $12,000 a day. The underlying protocol of Bitcoin does allow for the relative difficulty of mining to be eased if it becomes to hard for miners to stay in operation. In fact, this happened last month for the first time since 2012. It could theoretically continue to become easier as the Bitcoin price drops. The issue is however, that this wasn’t supposed to happen. Bitcoin’s price was supposed to keep increasing as more Bitcoins came onto the market. Bitcoins value relies purely on the belief of the people who buy and sell it. There is no central bank or government around to support it in the case of its value crashing to zero. Once that belief is questioned, Bitcoin becomes unsustainable. Even if the price of Bitcoin doesn’t go to zero, the chances the Bitcoin community convincing the wider public, governments, and industry that Bitcoin really represents the future of the world’s digital economy will become extremely unlikely. For the time being, Bitcoin still has enough devotees who believe that the currency will eventually recover and still claim the crown as the future enabler of all digital commerce. However, even they are having their doubts that this grand technological experiment may have run its course.::2015-01-13T14:24:08Z::::David Glance::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/68848/original/image-20150113-28434-1bbzbr4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

Ritual raised $25 million last November to address the centralized nature of AI systems. The investment was led by Archetype and included participation from Accomplice and Robot Ventures. Now Polychain has put a ribbon on the funding round. In an email to CoinDesk, it declined to disclose the exact amount invested. AI has become an area of interest in the blockchain industry following the proliferation of AI-powered tools and their increased mainstream popularity over the last year or so. Blockchain firms are attempting to address concerns that Big Tech giants like Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META) and Alphabet (GOOG) will build an AI oligarchy by introducing decentralization into the storage of data and access to infrastructure. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes joined Ritual's board of advisers in January, referring to the need to "ensure the burgeoning AI economy has access to a more censorship-resistant, collaboration-powering technology than we currently have."

43::https://ambcrypto.com/shiba-inus-q2-price-prediction-will-shib-retest-0-000030/::AMBCrypto::article::Shiba Inu’s Q2 price prediction: Will SHIB retest $0.000030?:: The golden cross suggests potential bullish trend for SHIB. But it also depends on the money and exchange flow.::The golden cross suggests potential bullish trend for SHIB. But it also depends on the money and exchange flow.  Shiba Inu [SHIB] posted an 11.69% increase in the last seven days. However, the token has been struggling to maintain that momentum over the last two days. Irrespective of that, some technical indicators suggest that the price could get back to its rally. One of the signals AMBCrypto observed was the golden cross on the 4-hour SHIB/USD chart. To get a golden cross, traders look at the Exponential Moving Average (EMA). This pattern forms when the shorter EMA crosses above the longer EMA.  At press time, the 20 EMA (blue) had crossed over the 50 EMA (yellow)—A golden cross, indicating a bullish trend. Furthermore, SHIB’s price had not slipped below the 50 EMA, meaning the thesis has not been invalidated. However, the Money Flow Index (MFI) was down to 30.21. This decrease indicates that a lot of capital has flowed out of the SHIB market. In a bearish situation, this could lead the price to $0.000022. However, the MFI might likely hit the oversold point, which could be around 20.00 or below. Should this be the case, the price of the Shiba Inu native token might rebound. Sustaining the golden cross if (when) this happens could take the price higher. Source: TradingView The likely first stop could be $0.000027, after which, SHIB’s value could rise to $0.000030, which was close to the ceiling it hit in March. For this, considering the technical aspect alone might be enough. Hence, AMBCrypto took things from the state of the token on-chain. In doing this, we assessed the exchange inflow and outflow. If the exchange inflow is higher than the outflow, it means that the token involved could face selling pressure, and the value could drop. On the other hand, a higher exchange outflow favors a price increase. As of this writing, SHIB’s exchange outflow was 53.20 billion. The inflow, at the opposite end, was 50.55 billion. Historically, the 3 billion difference between the metrics might not be enough to support a one-directional movement. As such, SHIB’s price might consolidate in the short term. Source: Santiment From our outlook, the price might move between $0.000023 and $0.000025. Going forward, traders might need to keep an eye on the netflow. In a case where the outflow doubles the exchange inflow, then we might see SHIB’s price move upward slowly. If sustained, a breakout to $0.00030 could be achieved. Read Shiba Inu’s [SHIB] Price Prediction 2024-2025 A summary of the analysis suggested that this rise could come to pass before the end of May. However, there is a likelihood that this prediction could be invalidated. Thus, traders might need to watch for changes in the status of Shiba Inu on-chain, and from the technical perspective.

This time, the Ethereum-based restaking platform EigenLayer is acknowledging its users, early adopters, and contributors with a much-anticipated airdrop. In addition to being a promotional event, the EigenLayer airdrop event is also a tested method to decentralized token ownership and encourage participation. But who can claim the tokens, and how does it work? This guide covers everything you need to know about EigenLayer airdrop eligibility and how to claim EigenLayer tokens. EigenLayer allows Ethereum stakers to further the utility of their staked ETH by using it across diverse, decentralized applications and protocols. Like many other platforms relying on blockchain technology, EigenLayer has also resorted to crypto airdrops to drive its strategic objectives. Here is the latest update released by the community: Updates on the EIGEN Stakedrop pic.twitter.com/1cwSForJnx Did you know? EigenLayer prefers to call its airdrops “stake drops,” focusing on increasing liquidity and enhancing the decentralized finance (DeFi) engagement. As mentioned, an airdrop from EigenLayer isn’t just a marketing gimmick. Instead, it comes with the following perks: Qualification for the EigenLayer airdrop depends on a user’s level of interaction with the EigenLayer ecosystem. Also, EigenLayer’s airdrop phases are segregated as Season 1 and Season 2, with Season 1 proceedings underway. Here’s a look at the eligibility (qualification) for Season 1. Firstly, the EigenLayer airdrop eligibility for season 1 is already taken care of via a snapshot that was captured on March 15, 2024. This means any move after this data capture will not result in additional tokens as part of the Season 1 rollout. Eligibility here depended on the extent of a user’s Ethereum restaking — either via staking in EigenLayer or utilizing other DeFi markets like Pendle. Staking via EigenLayer is eligible for 90% of the Season 1 stake drops, also referred to as Phase 1. Phase 2 stands for 10% of the airdrop rollout via Ethereum restaking using platforms other than the EigenLayer platform. Here are other aspects of the Season 1 rollout: Here are some additional details regarding the Phase 1 and Phase 2 of Season 1: Also, you can check the claim status of the Season 1 stake drop while reviewing the terms and conditions: Phase 2 details: The Eigenlayer FAQ docs offer clear information regarding the $EIGEN airdrop: Regarding the allocation process in Phase 2: – The Eigen Foundation communicated to each LRT project the amount of EIGEN reserved for their users. – Each LRT project will provide a list of wallet… pic.twitter.com/hRFg4wEoCE Even though the details of Season 2 are not yet completely clear, we could see another 5% of the allocated 15% as Season 2 stakedrops. Also, the focus of Season 2 will be on long-term engagement and protocol-specific contributions. Also, any kind of protocol interaction that happened after March 15, 2024, will qualify for Season 2. Here are some of the qualification metrics for Season 2: Other qualification details will be revealed by EigenLayer in days to come. Season 1 is done. However, here are the steps to participate in Season 2 of crypto airdrops from EigenLayer. Here is how the points are calculated: So it appears $EIGEN might be launching this week? I've seen pretty strong rumours but nothing is confirmed ofc. I created this sheet a few weeks back which shows the value of EigenLayer points as a function of the airdrop % and $EIGEN FDV Note, this assumes $EIGEN snapshot is… pic.twitter.com/rvcMLiGEfi Once the EigenLayer tokens are released, the entire aspect of DeFi integration will change. Based on what might happen, the airdrop eligibility for Season 2 can be determined via the following strategies: Simply put, EigenLayer might end up giving users free tokens to provide liquidity. Staking providers will also be able to manage and tweak their liquidity stake depending on the performance and health of the pool. Season 1 hasn’t been kind to the DeFi markets: Was just about to post a long rant but you should read the post below instead. Pendle and other EigenLayer DeFi users don't receive only 10% of the airdrop. It seems what they are trying to convey is that only 10% of the points generated in S1 came from these activities.… https://t.co/ZzKVvl5t0U Note: Only the Season 1 airdrop structure was eligible for testnet-based allotment via Goerli testnet. Now that Goerli is deprecated, newer testnet interactions via Holesky are not eligible to receive EigenLayer tokens as airdrops. In addition to the mentioned options, EigenLayer’s airdrop eligibility for Season 2 and other upcoming seasons might also depend on how well users stack up against Sybil attacks. The platform has already implemented strategies to prevent users from creating more than one account to claim multiple tokens. Over time, the robust identity verification process might be implemented throughout the ecosystem, with each instance attracting free tokens as airdrops. Honesty could go a long way in users receiving the EigenLayer airdrops. Before delving deeper into the criticisms, let us take a look at the Season 1 token allotment highlights: Other concerns highlighted: Had 3000 points but they disappeared 24h before claim, was left with 240 points. My manta supply and stake was never taken into account. My Pyth eligibility vanished. Today 0 zero ! It's like Eigen, layer zero, Linea, … don't like these EVM airdrops Here is a detailed explanation highlighting the rationale behind additional tokens, country-specific restrictions, and more: Why EigenLayer Gave Away More Tokens After Widespread Criticism of Its Stakedrop@sreeramkannan and @rjdrost discuss the loved and hated @EigenLayer airdrop and how they responded to community feedback. 💴 The role of EIGEN 🤑 Why they are giving users 100 additional EIGEN… pic.twitter.com/czaoZ1rl2A (Historical Image – 2024 – Colorized) The face of US users who spent 3 months paying 15% yields, loop farming Eigenlayer points on farming protocols, after reading they can't get the airdrop. pic.twitter.com/gvla3DxrBk Based on how things were for Season 1, experts believe the following enhancements will surface across the upcoming airdrop seasons: Season 1 of EigenLayer airdrops clearly mentions that the tokens are non-transferable. This means even after claiming EigenLayer tokens, you cannot simply move them to DEXs and CEXs to offload. Even though this initial restriction was criticized by many, it makes sense when it comes to avoiding rapid sell-offs. Based on how other airdrops in the past have materialized, gradual token releases are expected once Phase 1 and Phase 2 airdrop claims are handled for Season 1. Also, we expect EIGEN tokens to be available on the leading crypto exchanges in time. With the EigenLayer airdrop or any other similar event, navigating the space requires you to be aware of the terms and conditions beforehand. From verifying eligibility to identity, you must cover every required element before proceeding. Furthermore, it is crucial to check and verify EigenLayer airdrop claims using only the official EigenLayer website page. Airdrops present opportunities for scammers, with unscrupulous parties often waiting to prey on unsuspecting users and compromise wallet security. The idea is to remain safe, aware, and prepared, all while having complete control over your custody options. The EigenLayer airdrop signifies the distribution of free EigenLayer tokens to the qualified participants. This move is aimed to kickstart the adoption of the EigenLayer ecosystem and incentivize people interested in staking the already staked Ethereum to secure the diverse fecentralized applications (DApps) and protocols associated with the Ethereum network. Participating in crypto airdrops comes with highly specific requirements. For instance, if you take the EigenLayer airdrop into consideration, staking in EigenLayer is the primary criterion. The more staked Ethereum you push into the EigenLayer ecosystem, regardless of the custody options, the higher your chances of getting airdrops. Yes, EigenLayer has announced or rather unveiled its native EigenLayer token — EIGEN. Meant to facilitate a handful of governance-specific activities, interaction with AVS, and other activities, this native token will make its way into user wallets via airdrops. EIGEN, within the EigenLayer ecosystem, will also help generate staking rewards. In time, it is expected to have DeFi-specific use-cases. EigenLayer airdrop is a way to get more people associated with the ETH 2.0 upgrade vision by incentivizing them to restake. With restaking, it is possible to passively secure a host of DApps and protocols on Ethereum without actively validating them using nodes and networks. Plus, this airdrop brings community involvement into the mix.

45::https://blockworks.co/news/nirvana-alternative-to-google-cloud-aws::Blockworks::article::Nirvana Cloud debuts as blockchain-optimized alternative to AWS and Google Cloud::Nirvana Labs is debuting its Nirvana Cloud computing service meant to work specifically with blockchain workloads.::The startup’s cloud service uses hardware optimized for blockchains Nirvana Labs and Adobe Stock modified by Blockworks Nirvana Labs is debuting its Nirvana Cloud computing service meant to work specifically with blockchain workloads. CEO Dan Burke told Blockworks that the startup raised $1.7 million in pre-seed funding, and counts blockchain platforms like Chainlink and Avalanche as clients. According to Burke, the company is hoping to lure Web3 projects away from more general purpose cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud, which are widely used across many industries, including the crypto space. But Nirvana is not building a decentralized computing platform, a la Golem, nor a decentralized storage solution like IPFS. Rather, it’s taking the centralized status quo and specializing it for Web3. Read more: Researchers use blockchain network to simulate the dawn of life on Earth AWS and Google Cloud provide public cloud services that enable the purchase of resources such as servers and storage via the internet. This arrangement is often cost-effective, as it eliminates the need for companies to maintain their own physical hardware. Blockchain applications tend to be compute-intensive though, which drives up the costs Web3 that companies are paying to public cloud providers. Crypto is big business for Amazon in particular, which hosts 35% of all Ethereum nodes, according to the website ethernodes. Nirvana Cloud says it can offer much reduced costs and better efficiency for blockchain workloads compared to AWS by doing away with unnecessary virtualization. In computing, virtualization allows for the creation of virtual machines (VMs) that operate independently from their underlying physical hardware. This essentially turns one physical computer into many virtual ones, allowing each to run its own tasks as if it were a separate machine. In short, virtualization makes it possible to run many different applications and processes without needing multiple physical computers. This lets cloud service providers offer a more efficient and flexible service to customers. But traditional services like AWS and Google Cloud, while versatile, often adopt a general-purpose approach that may not be as cost or resource-efficient for specific applications, like the energy-intensive ones found in Web3. Read more: Cloud computing is operated by an anti-competitive oligopoly, says Osuri Nirvana Labs addresses this by reducing the virtualization layer. It slims down the middleman software and focuses its hardware on the specific needs of Web3 technologies, like cryptocurrency transactions or smart contracts. The result is a setup that’s not just faster and more reliable for these tasks, but also more cost-effective. A Nirvana Labs document reviewed by Blockworks suggests that, for a setup with two virtual CPUs and 8 gigabytes of RAM, Nirvana Cloud costs about 19.5% less than AWS and 26.91% less than Google Cloud Platform per month. According to the company, Nirvana Cloud distinguishes itself by offering a “bare metal” cloud service. Unlike typical cloud environments where server resources are shared among multiple consumers, each Nirvana server is dedicated to a single client. This approach, where hardware resources are not pooled, is meant to ensure superior performance for computation-heavy tasks, like blockchain validation, by maximizing the efficiency and reliability of the service. Read more: Google Cloud eyes more involvement in fast-evolving Web3 segment However, some would argue that solutions like Nirvana’s don’t go far enough — and that computing resources will always be a risk for crypto unless the base layer is decentralized. “We have decentralized payments. We have decentralized storage. We have to have decentralized compute or else this whole decentralized world isn’t really decentralized,” Tom Trowbridge, co-founder of decentralized computing platform Fluence, said. But in the interim, increased scrutiny on the cloud layer couldn’t hurt. Burke said that the Web3 development world often doesn’t think enough about what’s happening at the tech’s layer zero. He jokingly added, “I mean, we have a company in the space called LayerZero that’s literally built on Google Cloud.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

The conviction comes after a trio of judges upheld allegations that Pertsev aided in laundering funds through the crypto mixer, which has been under scrutiny for its role in high-profile cybercrimes, including a $600 million heist affecting the Ronin Bridge, linked to the notorious Lazarus Group from North Korea. Defense arguments posited that holding developers accountable for the potential misuse of decentralized platforms sets a dangerous precedent, a sentiment widely supported in the cryptocurrency sector. However, the court dismissed these defenses, emphasizing that the design of Tornado Cash was inherently aimed at supporting illegal activities and that technological innovation does not absolve individuals from legal responsibilities. Pertsev’s arrest in August 2022 followed shortly after the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) imposed sanctions on Tornado Cash for its alleged roles in laundering and financing illicit activities. Initially detained for eight months, Pertsev was later placed under house arrest. The court has decided that his time served will be deducted from the total sentence, effectively reducing his remaining prison term to approximately four years and six months. This case could significantly influence how global legal systems interpret and manage decentralized privacy technologies and crypto mixers. While Pertsev’s co-founders, Roman Storm and Roman Semenov, face similar charges in the United States, broader regulatory challenges persist. In the U.S., the debate intensifies as lawmakers and enforcement agencies clash over the regulatory framework for digital assets and decentralized finance (DeFi), highlighting a critical need for clarity and consensus in digital currency governance. Recent inquiries by U.S. Senators into the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network’s (FinCEN) approach to prosecuting crypto mixers as illegal money transmitters underscore the ongoing legislative and judicial complexities surrounding cryptocurrency operations. As the sector continues to evolve, the outcomes of such cases will likely have profound implications for the development and regulation of privacy-focused technologies in the financial landscape. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

47::https://cryptobriefing.com/crypto-pioneer-netki-powers-seamless-kyc-and-compliance-solutions-across-the-sui-ecosystem/::Crypto Briefing::article::Crypto Pioneer Netki Powers Seamless KYC and Compliance Solutions Across the Sui Ecosystem::N/A::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands, May 16th, 2024, Chainwire  Today, Netki, a digital identity verification leader, announced the launch of their pioneering compliance oracle – DeFi Sentinel – on Sui, the Layer 1 blockchain and smart contract platform. The integration introduces an essential tool for developers that automates compliance within their protocols, allowing them to focus on shipping high-impact projects instead of spending time developing tools to meet complex, ever-changing regulations that often differ across jurisdictions. Institutions are eager to engage with DeFi protocols and technology but need to ensure that all of their trades, and trading partners, meet their compliance standards. Until now, these institutional players have been forced to either trade in manually managed pools with limited liquidity and trading volume, or to avoid DeFi altogether. With DeFi Sentinel on Sui, developers can meet institutional as well as regulator requirements via a one-time integration. DeFi Sentinel leverages Netki’s advanced technology to provide real-time KYC/AML, wallet screening, financial transaction monitoring, securities compliance, and tax compliance, all now integrated directly within the DeFi protocols on Sui that choose to implement the tool. The solution combines on-chain and off-chain data to ensure each transaction adheres to institutional risk, as well as regulatory standards. Sui will also integrate Netki’s OnboardID, which, for protocols that enable it, enhances user onboarding and identity verification processes, reducing costs and simplifying compliance around the onramping process for Sui developers’ applications. Netki’s integration represents a significant advancement in making decentralized financial systems safer and more accessible globally. “DeFi protocols are poised to transform financial services by enhancing accessibility and transparency, but many of the best ideas fail to get off the ground due to compliance concerns,” said Evan Cheng, CEO of Mysten Labs, the original contributor to Sui. “Netki’s integration not only fortifies the security and compliance of transactions on Sui but also assures institutional and individual participants of their adherence to evolving regulatory requirements, and most importantly, gives developers the peace of mind to build with confidence.” Netki’s DeFi compliance oracle is unique in the industry, enabling transaction-by-transaction compliance, which is crucial for institutional adoption of DeFi tools. With features like real-time name and wallet screening, the solution ensures that compliance and risk management are seamlessly integrated into the transaction flow without compromising the user experience or developer agility. “By integrating DeFi Sentinel with Sui’s robust and scalable blockchain infrastructure, we are setting a new standard for safety and compliance in the DeFi space,” said Justin Newton, CEO of Netki. “We aim to enable the safe and widespread adoption of DeFi technologies, ensuring that developers can focus on innovation while evolving and expanding compliance requirements are effortlessly met.”  Sui Foundation [email protected] Share this article The information on or accessed through this website is obtained from independent sources we believe to be accurate and reliable, but Decentral Media, Inc. makes no representation or warranty as to the timeliness, completeness, or accuracy of any information on or accessed through this website.

48::https://theconversation.com/ethereum-what-is-it-and-why-has-the-price-gone-parabolic-153733::The Conversation::article::Ethereum: what is it and why has the price gone parabolic?::While bitcoin is only a currency, the second-largest cryptocurrency is at the heart of a platform that aims to transform the internet.::The price of the world’s second largest cryptocurrency, ether, hit a new all-time high of US$1,440 (£1,050) on January 19. This breached a previous high set three years ago and gave ether a total value (market capitalisation) of US$160 billion, although it has since fallen back to around US$140 billion. Ether, which runs on a technology system known as the ethereum blockchain, is worth over ten times the price it was when it bottomed during the COVID market panic of March 2020. And the cryptocurrency is still only five years old. In part, this remarkable rise in the value is due to excess money flowing into all the leading cryptocurrencies, which are now seen as relatively safe store-of-value assets and a good speculative investment. Ether/US$ price But ether’s price rise has even outstripped that of the number one cryptocurrency, bitcoin, which “only” had a seven-fold increase since March. Ether has outperformed partly due to several improvements and new features being rolled out over the next few months. So what are ether and ethereum and why is this cryptocurrency now worth more than corporate giants such as Starbucks and AstraZeneca? Blockchains are online ledgers that keep permanent tamper-proof records of information. These records are continually verified by a network of computer nodes similar to servers, which are not centrally controlled by anyone. Ether is just one of over 8,000 cryptocurrencies that use some form of this technology, which was invented by the anonymous “Satoshi Nakamoto” when he released bitcoin over a decade ago. The ethereum blockchain was first outlined in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, a 19-year old prodigy who was born in Russia but mostly grew up in Canada. After crowdfunding and development in 2014, the platform was launched in July 2015. As with the bitcoin blockchain, each ethereum transaction is confirmed when the nodes on the network reach a consensus that it took place – these verifiers are rewarded in ether for their work, in a process known as mining. But the bitcoin blockchain is confined to enabling digital, decentralised money – meaning money that is not issued from any central institution unlike, say, dollars. Ethereum’s blockchain is categorically different in that it can host both other digital tokens or coins, and decentralised applications. Decentralised applications or “dapps” are open-source programs developed by communities of coders not attached to any company. Any changes to the software are voted on by the community using a consensus mechanism. Perhaps the best known applications running on the ethereum blockchain are “smart contracts”, which are programs that automatically execute all or parts of an agreement when certain conditions are met. For instance, a smart contract could automatically reimburse a customer if, say, a flight was delayed more than a prescribed amount of time. Many of the dapp communities are also operating what is known as decentralised autonomous organisations or DAOs. These are essentially alternatives to companies and seen by many as the building blocks of the next phase of the internet or “web 3.0”. A good example is the burgeoning trading exchange Sushiswap. Ethereum has evolved and developed since its launch six years ago. In 2016, a set of smart contracts known as “The DAO” raised a record US$150 million in a crowdsale but was quickly exploited by a hacker who siphoned off one- third of the funds. However, since then, the ethereum ecosystem has matured considerably. While hacks and scams remain common, the overall level of professionalism appears to have improved dramatically. Financial interest in ether tends to follow in the wake of bitcoin rallies because it is the second-largest cryptocurrency and, as such, quickly draws the attention of the novice investor. All the same, there are other factors behind its recent rally. The first is the pace of innovation on the platform. Most activity in the cryptocurrency space happens on ethereum. In 2020, we saw the emergence of decentralised finance (DeFi). DeFi is analogous to the mainstream financial world, but with the middleman banks cut out. Users can borrow, trade, lend and invest through autonomous smart contracts via protocols like Compound, Aave and Yearn Finance. It sounds like science fiction, but this is no hypothetical market – approximately US$24 billion is locked into various DeFi projects right now. Importantly, DeFi allows users to generate income on their cryptocurrency holdings, especially their ether tokens. The second factor behind the ether surge is the launch of ethereum 2.0. This upgrade addresses major concerns impacting the current version of ethereum. In particular, it will reduce transaction fees – especially useful in DeFi trading, where each transaction can end up costing the equivalent of tens of US dollars. Ethereum 2.0 will also eliminate the environmentally wasteful mining currently required to make the ethereum blockchain function (the same is true of many other cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin). Within the year, ethereum should be able to drop the need for vast industrial mining warehouses that consume huge amounts of energy. Instead, transactions will be validated using a different system known as “proof-of-stake”. The sense that ethereum addresses problems like these quickly rather than letting them sit could prove a major differential from the sometimes sluggish and conservative pace of the bitcoin development culture. A final factor is the launch of ethereum futures trading on February 8. This means that traders will be able to speculate on what ether will be worth at a given date in the future for the first time – a hallmark of any mature financial asset. Some analysts have said the recent bitcoin rally has been fuelled by traditional investment firms, and the launch of ethereum futures is often touted as opening the doors for the same price action. However, as every seasoned cryptocurrency user knows, both currencies are extremely volatile and are as liable to crash by extremes as rise by them. Bitcoin’s price fell 85% in the year after the last bull market in 2017, while ether was down by 95% at one stage from its previous high of US$1,428. Whatever the valuation, the future of ethereum as a platform looks bright. Its challenge is ultimately external: projects such as Cardano and Polkadot, created by individuals who helped launch ethereum itself, are attempting to steal ethereum’s crown. But as bitcoin has shown, first-mover advantage matters in cryptocurrency, and despite bitcoin’s relative lack of features it is unlikely to be moved from its dominant position for some time. The same is most likely true for the foreseeable future with ethereum.::2021-01-21T19:41:57Z::Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, DeFi, Ethereum, Web 3.0::Donncha Kavanagh::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/379971/original/file-20210121-13-i5zie0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=5%2C281%2C3910%2C1952&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

The sale of GBTC shares was completed on April 2, the documents show. On Feb. 15, Genesis received permission from a New York bankruptcy court to sell the nearly 36 million shares in GBTC, as well as additional shares in two Grayscale Ethereum trusts. At the time of the application, lawyers for the estate valued the Grayscale shares at a collective $1.6 billion – nearly $1.4 billion in GBTC, $165 million in Grayscale Ethereum Trust, and $38 million in Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust. At today’s price of around $67,500, the bitcoin purchased with the proceeds of the GBTC shares alone are worth nearly $2.2 billion. As for what Genesis will do with its large bitcoin stack, initial plans are for the tokens to be distributed to its Gemini Earn creditors. Edited by Stephen Alpher.

Chainlink [LINK] has gained much traction of late as its price rallied substantially during the last week. Interestingly, the token’s popularity rose while Bitcoin [BTC] dominance witnessed a slight drop in the recent past. Let’s take a closer look at what’s actually going on. Source: CoinStats IntoTheBlock recently posted a tweet highlighting quite a few interesting developments related to Chainlink.  The tweet first mentioned that there was a significant rise in LINK search trend data, reflecting newfound interest in the token. The rise in popularity had a positive impact on the blockchain’s network activity, as its number of transactions started spiking. To be precise, LINK recorded 5.82k transactions during the last day, which was near its monthly high. However, it was interesting to note that the rise in transactions didn’t help attract more users, as there was not a major change in its new address graph. But things looked good in terms of investors’ interest as accumulation increased. As per the tweet, there were mostly net withdrawals from exchanges, hinting at accumulation behavior. Apart from that, whales were also stockpiling LINK, as its addresses holding over 0.1% of the supply show a net accumulation of 25 million LINK over the past month. The rise in accumulation actually helped the token begin a bull rally. According to CoinMarketCap, LINK was up by more than 20% in the last seven days. At the time of writing, it was trading at $16.22 with a market capitalization of over $9.5 billion. Thanks to that, LINK’s MVRV ratio registered a massive increase, suggesting that more investors were in profit. Its Open Interest also increased along with its price, hinting at a continued price rally. Source: Santiment Interestingly, Santiment recently posted a tweet highlighting that bullish sentiment around the token increased. In fact, Chainlink was witnessing the most bullish sentiment in over a year. However, these positive metrics didn’t help LINK sustain its bull rally, as the token’s price dropped by nearly 2% in the last 24 hours. To see whether this was the end of LINK’s double-digit bull rally, AMBCrypto analyzed its daily chart. As per our analysis, the MACD remained in the buyers’ favor. Is your portfolio green? Check out the LINK Profit Calculator Moreover, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) registered a sharp uptick. This indicated that the latest price correction might be short-term and that LINK would resume its rally soon. However, the token’s price had touched the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands, which looked concerning.

52::https://blockworks.co/news/blockchain-transparency-bug::Blockworks::article::Blockchain transparency is a bug::Opinion: Blockchain transparency is making Web3 the surveillance tool it was meant to free societies from.::Blockchain transparency is making Web3 the surveillance tool it was meant to free societies from Artwork by Crystal Le Blockchain transparency is a bug. Transparency isn’t a feature of decentralization that is truly needed to perform on-chain transactions securely — it’s a bug that forces Web3 users to expose their most sensitive financial data to anyone who wants to see it. Several blockchain marketing tools have emerged over the past few years, allowing marketers and salespeople to use the freely flowing on-chain data for user insights and targeted advertising. But this time, it’s not just behavioral data that is analyzed. Now, your most sensitive financial information is also added to the mix. Web3 will never become mainstream unless we manage to solve this transparency problem. Blockchain and Web3 were an escape from centralized power, making information transparent so that centralized entities cannot own one’s data. Then 2020 came, Web3 and NFTs boomed, and many started talking about how free flowing, available-to-all data is a clear improvement from your data being “stolen” by big data companies as a customer. Some may think if everyone can see the data, transparency will empower users to take ownership of and profit from their own data. Yet, transparency does not mean data can’t be appropriated nor that users are really in control. The fact that data is transparent and flowing freely doesn’t mean it cannot be appropriated; in fact, data appropriation is already happening in Web3. Many are taking advantage of all of this open data to simplify on-chain data analysis and monetize it for anyone interested in learning the behavioral patterns of Web3 users. With the immense number of transactions and wallets, the large volume of data becomes a goldmine for those skilled enough to understand it. Transparency opened doors for Web2’s profiling practices to enter Web3. Tools like Nansen or Addressable help agencies and advertisers gather transactional and asset-held data to analyze consumer behavior and holdings to understand trends, create potential customer profiles and launch targeted advertising programs. Privacy projects will argue that total privacy as a given is the only way to protect users. Yet, they aren’t right either. Users already need — and increasingly will need — to use their on-chain data to verify holdings and transactions for regulatory purposes and verifications. If everything is private and cannot be selectively encrypted, there is no way to verify the funds and their origins. Many such privacy solutions have already been sanctioned by governments. Read more from our opinion section: Ethereum L2s are a bug masquerading as a feature At the same time, users might want to proudly showcase some of their assets (like NFTs). But this doesn’t mean they want to allow everyone else to peek into all their other crypto holdings and transactions (which they do, since an address holding a certain NFT can be checked). Take 50 people holding NFTs for one project, analyze their other holdings and trends across transactional patterns, and you have a pretty accurate user profile you can target. Web3 needs to shift from the appropriation of freely flowing data to a data ownership model, where users get full control over what data gets shared, with whom, when and how. Vitalik Buterin addressed this transparency problem, posing a similar solution in his September paper on blockchain privacy and regulatory compliance. He argued that transparency is a security issue and showed there is a way to allow Web3 to be compliant and transparent only when needed. The solutions and the technology to make this shift are here. What is now needed is a change in user mindset and awareness that this transparency bug exists. Blockchain transparency is making Web3 become the surveillance tool it was meant to free societies from. It poses a growing concern, especially as the popularity of community rewards platforms increases and more and more users are combining their wallet addresses with social media accounts. The Web3 crowd needs to be educated about the risks of keeping all their data out in the open. In the decentralized world, the change needs to happen bottom-up as people realize how their blockchain transactions are being monetized for uses they have no control over.

Discover the latest updates and ongoing connectivity issues post-outage.::Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange based in the United States, has announced the restoration of some services following a significant system-wide outage that temporarily halted trading activities across its website and mobile application. The issue, initially reported on May 14, resulted in restricted access for numerous users, who experienced difficulties connecting to the platform. Approximately two hours after first acknowledging the disruption, Coinbase conveyed through an update that while services were partially restored, some users might still face connectivity issues. The initial incident, occurring at approximately 21:19 PDT on May 13, was reported on Coinbase’s status page, indicating that users could encounter errors when attempting to send funds. However, specifics regarding the cause of these failures were not provided. As of the latest update, the Coinbase status page has declared the incident resolved, though the exact reasons behind the two-hour outage remain undisclosed. Typically, centralized cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase suffer downtimes due to market volatility spikes or surges in blockchain network traffic. A previous technical hiccup in March saw similar disruptions, with Coinbase users witnessing zero balances in their accounts during a Bitcoin surge, as noted by Bloomberg. This incident underscored the susceptibility of crypto trading platforms to technical setbacks amid market fluctuations. Contrastingly, the recent outage appears to stem from internal technical issues within the exchange’s infrastructure, as market data from CoinGecko shows minimal movement in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), with changes of +0.31% and -0.44% respectively over the past 24 hours. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

Talos users will now be able to access One Trading’s high-speed trading platform, with a matching engine time of just 1 microsecond. In addition to expanding its potential reach to Talos’s institutional clients, One Trading also adopts the Talos trading platform as a sell-side client to support its OTC trading desk. The award-winning Talos trading platform will help One Trading efficiently source liquidity to better serve its clients’ needs. The multi-faceted relationship between the two firms highlights the different ways that the Talos network and platform can enhance a partner’s business. “We are thrilled to welcome One Trading into the Talos network of liquidity providers,” said Daniel Packham, VP and Head of Operations, EMEA. “They have built a leading regulated trading venue in Europe using cutting-edge technology to build an incredibly fast and secure exchange, holding themselves to the highest standards of security and transparency that are important to Talos and our institutional clients. In addition, as a client themselves using our trading platform, One Trading is a great example of how an OTC dealer can leverage Talos to help manage liquidity efficiently.” Commenting on the integration, Joshua Barraclough, CEO of One Trading said, “Talos shares our goal of bridging the gap between traditional and crypto asset trading. That’s why we’re excited to integrate with Talos as a liquidity provider as well as a sell-side trading client. They provide us with the same institutional grade of technology that we seek to provide to our own clients.” One Trading is an EU-based trading venue built by a highly experienced ex-TradFi team.

55::https://theconversation.com/decentralised-finance-calls-into-question-whether-the-crypto-industry-can-ever-be-regulated-151222::The Conversation::article::Decentralised finance calls into question whether the crypto industry can ever be regulated::It is near impossible to regulate currencies and financial services that were built to avoid regulation – but it is increasingly necessary::As stock markets around the world struggle through the pandemic, Bitcoin has seen a steady rise in its price. The cryptocurrency is steadily climbing back towards its all time high of US$20,000 (£15,000) in 2017. While this growth can be partially explained by investors being spooked by stock markets during the pandemic and looking for better investments, it is also influenced by the new, but evolving, decentralised finance market, also known as DeFi. DeFi allows people to engage in financial services such as borrowing, lending and investing but without intermediaries such as banks using blockchains and cryptocurrencies. Blockchains store digital records of transactions. Individual records, called “blocks”, are linked together in a single list, which creates the “blockchain”. Blockchains are used in DeFi to create “smart contracts”, which are automated, enforceable agreements that don’t need intermediaries, such as banks. The DeFi market is one to watch. It has grown to become worth US$14.61 billion – an increase of almost 700% since the beginning of 2020. DeFi has enormous potential in international trade by making payments more efficient. It could do away with the need to use intermediaries such as correspondent banks, which are financial institutions that offer services to a customer on behalf of another bank, usually in a foreign country. DeFi could also potentially help with the availability and equality of opportunities to access financial services. There is, however, a difficulty holding any particular person or entity accountable for any technological failure in this market. This can be anything from security failures, when the system is hacked and digital assets are stolen, to the collapse of the entire system. Read more: While coronavirus rages, bitcoin has made a leap towards the mainstream Unlike traditional banks, which can be sanctioned or shut down, there is nobody who can be held accountable or take responsibility when something goes wrong. This is because the applications in DeFi are built on decentralised systems, which distribute functions and power away from a central location or authority. Every node (computer, IP, server) connected to the system makes its own decision, and the final behaviour of the system is a collection of the decisions of these individual nodes. This is further complicated by the fact that DeFi transactions typically operate globally, and when regulatory standards are created for this sector in one country, platforms may gravitate to countries with less strict ones. There is also the challenge of global coordination, especially as countries are at varying stages of financial regulatory development. While advanced economies such as the UK and US have stronger regulatory frameworks, most in developing economies do not. DeFi platforms are also subject to hacks and cyberattacks and are growing platforms for money laundering. These factors raise the question of whether decentralised platforms can ever be regulated, or if the rules for the crypto industry set by the Financial Actions Task Force (FATF), the global anti-money laundering watchdog, is robust enough. FATF only covers centralised systems or virtual assets service providers such as cryptocurrency exchanges. These are licensed businesses that allow customers to trade crypto or digital currencies for other assets, such as fiat currencies like the pound sterling, US dollars and euros. Such exchanges must adhere to FATF’s “know your customer” requirements, where the platforms are expected to know the parties transacting on them. FATF requirements do not cover financial activities occurring on decentralised systems. The idea of regulating centralised platforms and cryptocurrency exchanges – where people purchase crypto to use to transact on DeFi platforms, but leaving DeFi platforms unregulated – limits the overall effectiveness of the regulation of the whole crypto industry. Unless it is built into the source code of a decentralised application, it is difficult to see how regulation can be achieved. This would require cooperation with blockchain software developers. However, this may be placing too much power in their hands as they could manipulate the code to circumvent regulatory oversight at any time they choose to. Regulators may not want to do this. They could try to ban such activities instead. In the EU and the US, legislation has been proposed that could potentially ban the operation of DeFi. These include the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) Regulation proposed by the EU and the US Stable Bill proposed in December 2020. Although it is not impossible to shut off a decentralised system, it is very difficult to achieve and it would require heavy reliance on government or regulatory authorities. It would also require getting access to IP addresses, cooperating with local internet service providers, identifying or tracing the physical location of people using the system and using the police to effectively shut down such platforms or activities. Locating and then prosecuting anyone within one jurisdiction would not be an easy task. Although this would potentially deter people from using these services and slow down the number of people using them for illegal means, it would be difficult to achieve on a global scale – which would threaten international standards. What is clear is that regulators need to acquire technological expertise and be willing to engage with a wider group of stakeholders, including software developers, to effectively regulate DeFi. It is worth noting that DeFi has been built mainly on the Ethereum blockchain, just as initial coin offerings (ICOs) were in 2017. ICOs eventually fizzled out due to their links with fraud. Whatever its future, DeFi is a fast-growing industry and deserves urgent regulatory attention.::2020-12-11T14:59:16Z::Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, DeFi, Finance, Regulation::Iwa Salami::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/374396/original/file-20201211-23-16e01n4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=53%2C377%2C6000%2C3000&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

The new APs include Wall Street banking giants Goldman Sachs, Citadel Securities, Citigroup and UBS as well as clearing house ABN AMRO, according to a prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). They join Jane Street Capital, JP Morgan, Masquarie and Virtu Americas. CoinDesk reported in January that Goldman Sachs was looking to play a key role for the bitcoin ETFs and was in talks with issuers about becoming an AP. APs are an integral part of the ETF process as they help create liquidity by changing the supply of shares when there’s a shortage or a surplus. Large ETFs typically have dozens of APs, and in less than three months of existence, IBIT has become fairly sizable with nearly $18 billion in assets under management as of the close yesterday. The participation of Goldman Sachs is particularly notable as its wealth management chief investment officer just this week said the bank believes that crypto has "no value" and feels no pressure to participate in the space even as other TradFi giants are taking major steps.

Toncoin [TON] has witnessed a spike in whale activity on its network in the past few weeks, CryptoQuant analyst Joao Wedson found in a new report. According to Wedson, whale transactions between 100,000 and 1 million TON on the network recently surpassed $1 billion, “Indicating significant activity among the largest addresses on the network.” Wedson added that while the smaller transactions under 100 TON make up the vast majority of the total activity on the Toncoin network, although,  “Their impact is relatively low, moving only around 4 to 5 million TON on the blockchain.” In contrast, large transactions between 100,000 and 1 million TON account for more than half (53%) of the network’s total volume. Further, transactions exceeding 1 million TON currently represent 30% of Toncoin’s total volume. Despite the surge in whale activity on its network, TON is poised to breach the lower line of its ascending channel, which formed a key support level since the beginning of the month. When an asset’s price trends this way, it signals that selling pressure is overcoming buying pressure, and a price decline might be imminent. TON’s recent fall below its 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) increases the likelihood of its price decline. Readings from the coin’s price movements on a daily chart showed that TON’s price crossed below its 20-day EMA on the 17th of May. This marked the first time this has happened since the month began. This crossover is significant because it suggests that TON’s press time price has fallen under its average price of the past 20 days. It marks a shift toward selling momentum and a possible decline in the coin’s price. Since then, TON’s value has dropped by 3%. According to CoinMarketCap, the altcoin traded at $6.45 at press time. Confirming the rise in bearish sentiments, TON’s MACD line was about to fall below its signal line at the time of writing. Source: TON/USDT on TradingView Is your portfolio green? Check out the TON Profit Calculator When this happens, it would mean that the coin’s short-term moving average has crossed below its long-term moving average, signifying a loss of upward momentum. If TON breaches support, its price might fall under $6 to trade at $5.70. However, if this is invalidated, a rally toward $6.7 is in the books.

This guide dives into the essential information about Tezos staking. We explain what it means to stake your XTZ holding and examine the various methods available. We explored multiple options over several weeks to identify the top platforms for buying Tezos (XTZ). Our selection criteria focused on the core elements that make the buying/trading experience reliable and efficient. Our evaluation was largely based on key metrics such as security, fees, liquidity, ease of use, and compliance. Here’s a quick look at the reasons why we chose the following platforms: Kraken Kraken stands out as a goliath in the crypto space, having earned the trust of users across the world with its stringent security measures and exceptional market liquidity. The exchange deploys features like cold storage options, 2FA, and encrypted data storage to ensure that your transactions remain under lock and key. Kraken caters to new and seasoned traders by offering a giant pool of trading information and competitive transaction fees. Coinbase As one of the world’s largest and most popular exchanges, Coinbase commands the kind of trust you expect from your go-to crypto trading platform. It offers an intuitive interface that suits crypto newcomers particularly well. However, it is equally practical for experienced users who prefer advanced trading tools and options. Coinbase operates under strict regulatory compliance and offers sizable liquidity for multiple XTZ trading pairs. Ledger Ledger offers a unique proposition — it is a hardware wallet manufacturer that allows users to stake XTZ directly from the security of their device. This method is ideal for those seeking the ultimate protection for their XTZ stash, as it aims to blend the impenetrable security of cold storage with the functionality of active staking. Exodus Wallet Exodus Wallet is ideal for buying Tezos (XTZ) due to its integrated exchange feature, which allows users to seamlessly purchase XTZ directly within the wallet interface. This built-in functionality eliminates the need for external exchanges, streamlining the process and reducing transaction complexity. Additionally, Exodus supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies, enabling easy portfolio diversification.

It has since become a major player in the blockchain space. Tezos facilitates the development and execution of smart contracts, which are basically self-executing agreements that power decentralized applications (DApps). Tezos allows stakeholders to participate in the network’s security and evolution by voting on proposed upgrades to the protocol. This approach eliminates the need or scope for any disruptive hard fork, which can ultimately fracture the user base. Notably, Tezos uses a unique proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism called liquid proof-of-stake (LPoS). Unlike many other blockchains, Tezos prioritizes formal verification, a process that enhances smart contract security by minimizing vulnerabilities. The platform also emphasizes modularity and upgradability, ensuring long-term scalability and adaptation. Tezos staking allows users to participate in the network’s consensus mechanism and contribute to its security. This is achieved through “baking” or delegating XTZ, Tezos’ native cryptocurrency. Bakers are champions of democracy. They accept delegation from tezos users through a liquid staking mechanic native to the chain. In turn, they are responsible for voting on Tezos issues in a manner that they feel furthers the interests of their delegates AND dole out staking… Baking vs. delegating: The delegation process in Tezos is relatively smooth and secure. It allows XTZ holders to contribute to network security without having to invest any substantial capital. Additionally, it safeguards them from the risk of asset loss due to slashing, which is a penalty enforced in many other proof-of-stake networks. This makes Tezos staking a popular choice for users looking to earn passive income while supporting network operations. You have two options if you plan on staking on the Tezos network. You could either be a baker or delegate your tokens to a baker. Each approach has advantages and drawbacks, so understanding the nuances is key to picking the one that best suits your risk appetite and goal. Bakers are the lifeblood of the Tezos network. They shoulder critical tasks like validating transactions, creating new blocks, and proposing and voting on network growth changes. However, this power comes with a hefty price tag — you must acquire a collateral of around 6,000 XTZ. This substantial financial commitment isn’t the only hurdle. As a baker, you also need specialized hardware to run the baking software and a decent amount of technical expertise to configure and manage their setups. Furthermore, you may have to be on your toes constantly to minimize downtime. This is important because a baker’s reputation depends squarely on their ability to run node operations reliably. That said, the rewards for bakers can be quite enticing. As a baker, you retain all block yields, ensuring a potentially lucrative return on your investment. So, to cut a long story short, bakers typically earn good returns on their investments, but baking is not a job for everyone. It demands serious commitment and comes with significant responsibility. You could consider delegating your XTZ to a baker if active participation seems overwhelming. This approach offers a more laid-back alternative. Your XTZ remains safely stored in your wallet, and you will have peace of mind knowing you have full control over your assets. This setup allows you to passively earn rewards and maintain a consistent source of passive income without any extra effort. While delegating offers flexibility, you have to beware of a few limitations. For instance, you can’t split your XTZ holdings across multiple bakers within the same wallet. However, you can change your delegation anytime by transferring your funds to a different wallet. Also, carefully evaluate a baker’s track record and commitment to fair reward distribution before signing up. Bakers typically charge a fee for their services, so assessing their fee structure and historical performance is crucial. If you are unsure whether to become a baker or a delegator, remember that it ultimately boils down to your risk tolerance, level of technical expertise, and the amount of time you can realistically dedicate to network participation. Follow these steps to start staking Tezos. For this demonstration, we’ll use Coinbase due to its user-friendly interface. The centralized exchange combines user-friendliness and security, making it a good option for XTZ staking. Other reputable options include Binance, Kraken, and OKX. The ideal platform depends on your priorities. Consider factors like security measures, ease of use, fees associated with staking, and the estimated annual yield (APY) offered. These factors can significantly impact your experience and the rewards you earn. Coinbase offers an APY of 4.51% on XTZ staking as of May 8, 2024. After choosing Coinbase as your staking platform, ensure you have Tezos (XTZ) in your account. You can purchase XTZ directly using fiat currency (USD or EUR) on Coinbase or transfer it from another wallet if you already own some. However, before proceeding any further, check your platform’s minimum staking amount requirement. Coinbase doesn’t have any minimum amount requirement, meaning you can start staking with 1 XTZ. Go to the staking section and choose from a list of available bakers or validators. Bakers are responsible for validating transactions and creating new blocks on the Tezos network. Evaluate each baker’s performance, reputation, and fees to find the best match that meets your expectations. Once you’ve selected a baker, specify the amount of XTZ you wish to delegate and confirm the transaction. You might need to verify the transaction using your password, PIN, or a security device, depending on your security settings. You will see a stake preview window. And that’s it! You have officially started earning rewards through Tezos staking. Tezos staking is beneficial for the staker and the network. Some of the key benefits of staking on Tezos include: While staking Tezos can earn you sizable profits, it’s important to understand the potential drawbacks: While it’s true that Tezos staking offers some exciting opportunities, just like with any other investment, there are certain risks. Here’s how you can avoid some of the common staking mistakes. Tezos rewards are shelled out periodically, with payouts happening after each cycle. These cycles clock in at roughly three days each. That said, there is a catch for those new to the staking game: an initial waiting period stands between you and your first Tezos payout. You may have to exercise patience for a few weeks after delegating your XTZ to a baker. This delay is necessary for the network to integrate your new delegation and ensure that your baking and endorsing rights are accurately factored in. As a Tezos staker, you may enjoy substantial rewards. Remember that staking rewards are taxable income in many jurisdictions, and Tezos staking is no exception. The exact tax implications may vary dramatically depending on your region. As a general rule of thumb, tax authorities expect individuals to report their staking rewards as income. This means you’ll be taxed on the fair market value of the XTZ you receive at the time of distribution. Keep in mind that it is not a matter of how much you paid for the original XTZ you staked. Rather, you will be paying taxes on the value of the newly minted XTZ rewards. You may also be subject to capital gains tax if you decide to sell your hard-earned staking rewards. This applies if the value of XTZ has climbed since you received it as a reward. We highly recommend users keep meticulous records of the dates and values when they receive and sell their XTZ. This is a must if you want to ensure you comply with tax regulations accurately. Kraken is a leading Tezos staking platform thanks to its superior security and commitment to user experience. Security-conscious users will appreciate Kraken’s industry-leading protective measures, such as comprehensive cold storage solutions and mandatory two-factor authentication. The platform offers a diverse range of staking options and competitive fees, positioning it as a versatile choice for seasoned users. Users also benefit from Kraken’s consistent uptime and stringent adherence to regulatory standards. Coinbase serves as an ideal entry point for beginners with its user-friendly interface and intuitive staking process. Being a regulated entity, Coinbase prioritizes user safety by maintaining a secure trading environment. Additionally, the platform allows for the direct purchase of XTZ using fiat currencies, facilitating an easy process to buy and stake Tezos without the need for an intermediary service. Ledger is one of our top platforms for staking Tezos (XTZ), renowned for prioritizing security to ensure the safest staking experience. Its hardware wallet technology is engineered to provide the highest protection possible. When you stake XTZ using a Ledger Wallet, you retain complete control over your private keys, which are stored offline, offering you ultimate peace of mind. This setup secures your Tezos assets from online threats while empowering you with direct management of your assets without intermediary risks. Exodus Wallet is a leading platform for staking XTZ as it expertly balances security with ease of use. The wallet is designed with a straightforward, intuitive interface and includes integrated staking functionality directly within the software, allowing for straightforward management of XTZ holdings. This makes it an outstanding choice for newcomers and experienced users who value a hassle-free and secure staking process. Additionally, Exodus supports many other cryptocurrencies, offering users the flexibility to manage multiple assets within a single platform, further enhancing its appeal as a comprehensive digital asset solution. If you’re interested in earning substantial passive income, Tezos (XTZ) presents a compelling opportunity. According to the Tezos block explorer TzStats, the staking rate exceeds 67% as of May 8. 2024, indicating that over two-thirds of all circulating XTZ tokens are actively staked. This high participation rate highlights the continued demand for Tezos staking. Furthermore, by staking XTZ, you can reap financial rewards and contribute to shaping the future of Tezos through your active involvement in its development. Remember that profits are never guaranteed, and the value of your holdings can fluctuate according to market sentiment and demand. Tezos staking remains an attractive option in 2024. With well over 67% of all XTZ tokens staked as of May 8, 2024, you can join a sizable community of active stakers earning passive income while contributing to network security. Beyond the financial rewards, staking also allows you to influence Tezos’ future by participating in its ongoing development. The exact APY for Tezos staking can fluctuate depending on various factors. These may include the platform you are using, the current staking rate, and network inflation. Tezos staking typically offers a competitive APY compared to other staking opportunities. For example, Coinbase offers an APY of around 4.51% for XTZ staking, whereas the corresponding figure for Ledger Wallet can go as high as almost 6%. You have multiple options to choose from. Popular choices include hardware wallets like Ledger, which offer a secure and user-friendly experience. You can also stake through cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase or other dedicated staking platforms. Ideally, researching different options would help you find one that aligns with your security preferences and staking goals.

59::https://blockworks.co/news/blockchain-mainstream-adoption-history::Blockworks::article::Blockchain is one step away from mainstream adoption::Opinion: We’re months and years, not decades, away from widespread Web3 adoption.::What could come next for Web3 is grounded in history — and completely unpredictable Artwork by Crystal Le There’s plenty going on with crypto and blockchain right now. But the biggest news of the year is still the Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval of spot bitcoin ETFs — with $4.5 billion in trading volume in the first 24 hours, all eyes are on how this new investment vehicle will impact public engagement with crypto and blockchain. Because even though blockchain technology has been in use (and in the public discourse) for over a decade, it’s still accurate to compare its progress to the early days of the internet. Its nascent point in evolution — and clear potential for eventual disruption — echoes Clayton M. Christensen’s disruptive innovation theory, a theory which highlights how technologies overturn established markets. No matter how revolutionary or unique, fresh innovation remains intrinsically tied to the past. By learning lessons from pioneering technologies that are now accepted as core to life and society, we can navigate the complexities of this next great technological shift. While there will be challenges in acceptance and utility along the way, I believe blockchain’s path to imminent mass adoption closely mirrors the innovation cycles of past technologies with humble, then astronomical trajectories. And the SEC’s spot bitcoin ETF approval is a moment that signals both validation and acceleration. Let me explain. Like the nascent stages of both the internet and cloud computing, blockchain’s initial phase was marked by enthusiasm tempered with challenges. Early blockchain adopters — akin to pioneers of cloud infrastructure — faced skepticism, technological hurdles and a lack of clear market fit. Data from the early 2010s reflects a burgeoning interest in blockchain but also reveals the struggles for finding practical applications and widespread adoption. It was during this period that the cryptocurrency space became the primary use case for blockchain technology. Bitcoin’s rise sparked curiosity and fueled on-chain experimentation. But while the promise of decentralized, trustless systems captivated innovators, its practical implementation faced numerous obstacles. Scalability issues, regulatory uncertainties and the association of blockchain with volatile cryptocurrency markets hindered its broader adoption. Blockchain technology was truly in its infancy in the early 2010s. And as with every groundbreaking innovation, overcoming the initial challenges required time, perseverance and a commitment to refining the technology’s capabilities. Within two to three years, blockchain technology expanded from testing labs and hackathons to real world business applications used by global giants like IBM and Maersk. In making the leap relatively quickly, the tech entered a phase akin to the dot-com era’s consolidation — where performance, utility and UX took out the first wave of providers failing to meet enterprise, developer and user expectations. During this period, blockchain gained crucial market recognition and investment growth, and its solutions began to demonstrate real-world utility. The industry also witnessed the emergence of alternative blockchain platforms like Ethereum, each offering unique features and addressing the limitations of earlier iterations. The mid-2010s also marked a turning point for blockchain, with a surge in enterprise adoption and a notable influx of tech industry attention anchored largely by progressive larger companies and startups. Although regulatory frameworks began to take shape around the world, country-specific dynamics remained in the path of providing a more stable environment for businesses to explore and implement blockchain technology. In both the dot-com era internet and blockchain during this phase, viable business models emerged — and along with them, substantial investments that lay the foundation for long-term sustainability. Like dot-com, blockchain was experiencing cracks at the seams as the underlying infrastructure and technology transitioned swiftly from a speculative concept to a legitimate technological innovation vulnerable to system failures, user sentiment and industry scrutiny. In other words, the enterprise, commercial and potential user spotlight was on, but the backend infrastructure remained painfully slow and the frontend UX remained noticeably lacking. Blockchain’s current phase mirrors the cloud computing industry’s evolution from nascent testing group populated with startups and risk-taking enterprises into a market staple with room to improve. While there’s still significant progress to make in terms of adoption and onboarding, processing, security, interoperability and UX, the advancements happening on blockchain today are nearing web grade and web scale. Today, blockchain technology underpins applications across industries, from finance to supply chain management — and this is only the beginning. Recent market analyses highlight blockchain’s expanding footprint, indicating its transition from an emerging technology to an integral part of the global digital infrastructure akin to cloud in Web2. In my opinion, we’re months and years, not decades, away from people around the world using Web3 to make financial transactions, scroll social media and play games at Web2 speeds — with UX at a level where users might not realize their digital experience is made possible by blockchain. Blockchain’s growth is already reshaping traditional business processes and models. In the financial sector, blockchain facilitates faster and more secure transactions. Supply chain management benefits from increased transparency and traceability, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of products. Smart contracts automate and streamline complex agreements, minimizing the risk of fraud and error. And in addition to sparking rising trading volumes, the SEC’s approval of spot bitcoin ETFs sent a global signal of validation to governments reviewing the viability of blockchain applications in both the private and public sectors. Importantly, the evolution of blockchain has given credence to — and bestowed practicality upon — the concept of decentralized finance (DeFi). We’re already in a reality where traditional financial services are replicated, and even improved, using blockchain technology. This is transformative because it will eliminate the need for intermediaries, opening the door to financial participation for virtually anyone with internet access. This democratization of finance has the potential to provide financial services to underserved populations and redefine the global financial landscape. Today (literally today), blockchain technology sits at the brink of a new era of the internet — one fueled by decentralized ecosystems at web scale. As we move forward, businesses, policymakers and builders will increasingly search out responsible, interoperable and secure blockchains that have a proven ability to scale and meet the needs of millions worldwide who will be using it daily. Most importantly, we can build a more transparent, efficient and inclusive digital world in the process. Mo Shaikh is the Co-Founder & CEO of Aptos Labs.

Despite accruing substantial daily fees, Runes has only eclipsed the $1 million mark in total fees on two separate occasions within the last twelve days, highlighting a noticeable downtrend. Initially, Runes catalyzed an investor frenzy following its launch on April 19, which coincided with the most recent Bitcoin halving event. This launch period saw an unprecedented surge in transaction fees, with miners collecting over $135 million in the first week alone. The Runes protocol quickly dominated Bitcoin transactions, reaching a peak transaction share of 81.3% on April 23. However, this dominance was short-lived as activity began to taper off, with significant declines noted particularly on May 10. The analytics from Dune, a leading blockchain analytics platform, confirm these observations. After an initial robust performance, the fee revenue from the Runes protocol has shown a consistent decline. Despite the protocol’s ability to still generate hundreds of thousands of dollars daily on the Bitcoin blockchain, the dwindling frequency of surpassing the $1 million threshold points to a broader trend of decreased activity. Developed by Casey Rodarmor, also known for creating Ordinals which introduced non-fungible tokens to the Bitcoin network, Runes extends this innovation by facilitating the creation of fungible tokens. This development promised enhanced tokenization capabilities over the existing BRC-20 standard, leading to a significant initial uptake and a burst in meme coin trading on the platform. Despite the declining transaction share, Runes displayed a brief recovery in early May, with transaction shares rebounding above 60% on May 4 and 5. However, this was not sufficient to sustain the earlier levels of engagement, and overall miner revenue on the Bitcoin network fell to below $30 million per day in May. The Runes protocol, despite its early success and the creation of several high-value Rune collections as reported by Magic Eden, faces the challenge of maintaining traction in a volatile market. Further innovation remains on the horizon, as hinted by Rodarmor with a forthcoming audioreactive generative art project during an Ordinals event in Hong Kong, potentially revitalizing interest in the platform. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

61::https://cryptobriefing.com/senators-question-crypto-transmitter-laws/::Crypto Briefing::article::Senators question DOJ for 'unprecedented interpretation' over Samourai Wallet and Tornado Cash::Senators say that the crypto mixer services under scrutiny don't meet money transmitter definitions.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) have sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland, questioning the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) “unprecedented interpretation” of the law in its pursuit of cryptocurrency software services, such as Samourai Wallet and Tornado Cash, as unlicensed money-transmitting businesses. The senators argue that the DOJ’s approach contradicts previous guidance from the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which held that non-custodial crypto services should not be treated as money transmitters. The lawmakers express concern that the DOJ’s interpretation could treat software developers as criminals for “merely writing and publishing code” used by others, setting a dangerous precedent that contradicts settled law and raises First Amendment concerns. The letter specifically addresses the DOJ’s recent pursuit of Samourai Wallet, a crypto privacy business, last month. The senators argue that subjecting developers of non-custodial crypto asset software to potential criminal liability as unregistered money transmitters goes against the well-established interpretation of the law. The DOJ has also argued in a court filing that FinCEN’s guidance on crypto mixers did not address the idea of “control,” a stance that the senators’ letter takes issue with. The lawmakers maintain that the rule actually requires the service to take control of the funds to be treated as a transmitter. Senator Lummis emphasized the importance of the issue, stating: “I’m concerned the DOJ’s interpretation would treat software developers as criminals for merely writing and publishing code used by others […]” The letter comes as Congress grapples with establishing comprehensive digital assets legislation, including money-laundering protections. A legislative piece called FIT21 (Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act) is expected to go up for deliberation by the House of Representatives soon. However, such a legislative piece would only be specific to the governance of crypto markets and would not, as such, establish clearer definitions of what constitutes illicit transactions or the facilitation of such exchanges through open software.

62::https://theconversation.com/altcoin-season-2-0-why-bitcoin-has-been-outgunned-by-crypto-rivals-since-new-year-132053::The Conversation::article::Altcoin season 2.0: why bitcoin has been outgunned by crypto rivals since new year::Bitcoin is up over 40% in 2020, but the likes of ethereum, bitcoin cash and bitcoin SV have all achieved triple-digit rises.::When bitcoin was trading at the dizzying heights of almost US$20,000 (£15,360) in December 2017, it was the peak of the previous bull run in cryptocurrencies. It was a classic bubble, in line with the work on such phenomena by the American financial economist Hyman Minsky, and investors should arguably have seen it coming. It was not until late 2018 that bitcoin finally bottomed out at slightly above US$3,000, though for many the “crypto winter” dragged on for much of 2019 as well. Several ups and downs later, the bull market looks to be back. Since the turn of the year, bitcoin has climbed from just over US$7,000 to the low US$10,000s. Few asset classes can boast a rise of about 40% in six weeks, though bitcoin enthusiasts like to point out that bitcoin is the best performing asset of the past decade – however choppy the journey along the way. Having said that, bitcoin is certainly not where you would have made most money if you had bought cryptocurrencies at the start of January. There have been even greater price gains from leading altcoins such as ethereum (+119%), ripple (+58%), bitcoin cash (+109%) and bitcoin SV (+222%). So what explains their superior performance? These four altcoins are the largest cryptocurrencies on the market after bitcoin, representing an aggregate US$51 billion market capitalisation (the value of each coin multiplied by the number of coins on the market). This is still fairly small compared with bitcoin’s US$178 billion market cap, but clearly the gap has been narrowing. Cryptocurrency aficionados compare bitcoin and the altcoins in terms of bitcoin dominance. This refers to bitcoin’s market size compared with the rest of the altcoins put together. During the early weeks of 2020, it fell slightly from 68% to 64%. As the chart below shows, this is a shift from what has happened for most of the past couple of years. Bitcoin dominance For years, there has tended to be a statistically significant correlation between the performance of bitcoin and the altcoins: when bitcoin rises or falls in price, most altcoins tend to do likewise. You can track this using online tools, such as Coinpredictor.io. Despite this correlation, altcoins have tended to underperform bitcoin ever since the previous bull market petered out in winter 2017-18. Bitcoin dominance was only 39% at the beginning of 2018, whereas it had risen to 70% by July 2019 and stayed around that range for most of the rest of the year. This suggests that bitcoin has acted as a safe harbour for many investors still smarting from the bubble and pop of 2017, which was fuelled by an explosion of initial coin offerings or ICOs from new currencies entering the market. Those who didn’t get out of cryptocurrencies altogether probably felt the need to consolidate around an asset they trusted. Bitcoin was the obvious choice as the longest established and most widely traded asset in this class, and also the gateway cryptocurrency for many investors – their first dip of a toe in the water en route to an altcoin purchase. Other writers have pointed out that during 2019, the price correlation between bitcoin and the altcoins declined. As many other cryptocurrency projects failed to live up to the heady expectations of a year or two before, investors perhaps traded them for bitcoin in a “flight to quality” – a little like traditional investors switching to the likes of gold when the stock market dives. The tilt back towards altcoins in the first weeks of 2020 may be the start of another bull-run, driven by a renewed confidence or understanding in the space. Recent favourable commercial developments have bolstered prices, such as JP Morgan’s positive progress with the interbank payments system that it runs on the ethereum network. The rise of the altcoins is also possibly being fuelled in part by an increasing number of coins entering the market. According to coinmarketcap, it now staggeringly numbers over 5,000. All other things being equal, this should reduce bitcoin dominance – this may be feeding through now that confidence has risen in the sector as a whole. There has also been a sector-wide boost from Coinbase, the largest cryptoasset exchange in the US. Coinbase is making a play for institutional investors by expanding its ability to store digital coins on their behalf outside the US. Known in the jargon as custodial solutions, Coinbase’s offering has just received two major industry kitemarks from leading accounting firm Grant Thornton, so may be attracting more institutional money into the sector. Another factor may be eagerly awaited initiatives from leading players such as the ethereum 2.0 launch, which looks set for July 2020. This major upgrade to the second-largest crypto network, which underpins many cryptocurrencies and enterprises in this space, is expected to make a big difference to transaction speeds among other things. One big question is whether bitcoin will start outperforming the altcoins again thanks to the so-called “halvening”, which is expected in May. This is the moment roughly every four years when the reward to bitcoin miners is halved, thereby reducing the number of new bitcoins available to sell on the market. Writers such as Jemima Kelly in the Financial Times make a strong case that this won’t raise the bitcoin price because the number of coins in circulation will still be rising and the event is built into the system so should be accounted for in the price already. Yet in a young market, which is comparatively thinly traded and has no uniform global regulation, the positive sentiment around this event may have more effect on the price than the fundamentals. We have previously argued in The Conversation that the chances of bitcoin replacing the global financial system have probably ended, now that many countries and multinationals, such as Facebook, are planning to launch cryptocurrencies of their own. All the same, the latest bull market is more evidence that bitcoin is likely to persist on the peripheries, probably along with the cream of the altcoins. Whether those altcoins can continue to outperform their bitcoin matriarch is a difficult question to answer, but they are showing encouraging signs of life. Naysayers who have predicted their steady demise may have spoken too soon.::2020-02-19T15:56:49Z::Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, Ethereum, Ripple::Gavin Brown::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/316197/original/file-20200219-11017-a7y6q2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=37%2C577%2C4105%2C2049&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

64::https://ambcrypto.com/predicting-how-eth-will-react-if-the-sec-approves-ethereum-etfs/::AMBCrypto::article::Predicting how ETH will react IF the SEC approves Ethereum ETFs::In spite of the general expectations, there is a chance the SEC will approve Ethereum ETFs.::In spite of the general expectations, there is a chance the SEC will approve Ethereum ETFs.  It is generally believed that the U.S. SEC will not approve any applications for the spot Ethereum [ETH] ETF due to several factors pointing to the fact that the agency’s new crypto enemy is Ethereum. But still, no real confirmation has been gotten from the agency itself on what it’s planning. So there is still a chance, no matter how slim, that the SEC would approve these ETFs. However, if they do, is the market ready for that impact? How would Ethereum’s price react?  Coinbase institutional research analyst David Han suggests there could be a surprising upside. In Coinbase’s monthly outlook report published on the 15th of May, Han mentioned that the odds of approval are between 30-40%. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has similarly set his approval odds at 35%. Meanwhile, the crypto community took a survey from Polymarket and the general estimate is 7% odds of approval. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, echoed the somewhat optimistic sentiment during an appearance on CNBC, saying that the SEC might approve spot ETH ETFs even if it does consider Ethereum a security Should the SEC approve an Ethereum ETF, the market could see an unexpected surge. However, Ethereum’s dominance and recent performance are trending toward their lowest point ever. Its SEC-proclaimed status as a security has negatively impacted investment sentiment. No one expects an approval, so Ether prices could likely see very little action in the near future. Bitcoin’s [BTC] price hardly reacted to its ETF approvals earlier this year. And the community were actually looking forward to it. Recently, the Funding Rate has been relatively low or negative, which could imply a cooling off of bullish momentum or increased caution among traders, especially during price dips as it happened in mid-April. Source: Coinglass Moreover, the increase in Open Interest despite lower trading volumes suggests that traders might be preparing for significant price moves ahead, as positions are being built up. But Ethereum’s trading chart shows a consistent bullish trend over a two-day period. The highest price point just above $3,160 could act as a short-term resistance level. Read Ethereum’s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25 Watching how the price reacts upon retesting this level could be critical for short-term investment strategies. Source: TradingView Given the strong upward momentum and successful price recovery post-retraction, if the market maintains its bullish sentiment, Ethereum could potentially break through the current resistance level.

APT holders can participate by voting on network proposals, leveraging the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. This article explores the top five platforms for users looking to buy APT, with insights into the unique features and advantages of each. BeInCrypto conducted a six-month evaluation to select the top five platforms where Aptos can be purchased. This assessment considered various factors specific to the platforms offering Aptos and other general criteria. Here are the factors evaluated for the chosen exchanges: Coinbase: Kraken: Bybit: Uphold: CoinEx To learn more about BeInCrypto’s Verification Methodilogy, follow this link. Coinbase has established itself as a leading platform in the crypto exchange market. Its extensive range of services is tailored to meet the needs of a global clientele. The platform is beginner-friendly, making it the perfect option for less-experienced users looking to buy APT with ease and without complexity. The U.S.-based platform is notably one of the most liquid regulated crypto spot exchanges in the world. Furthermore, Coinbase offers over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks in the U.S. and Europe, available to approved Coinbase Prime customers worldwide, providing a specialized service for high-volume traders. The platform also features Coinbase Custody, enhancing security for institutional clients needing to safely store large volumes of cryptocurrencies. Kraken is one of our top choices for buying and selling APT thanks to its long-standing industry reputation and wide global presence. Founded in 2011 by Jesse Powell, Kraken is among the oldest and most established crypto exchanges and operates across Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania, and South America. Kraken provides a straightforward interface and caters to all user levels. It also facilitates both margin and futures trading, catering to sophisticated traders looking to leverage their positions. Notably, the exchange is renowned for its strong focus on security. The CEX implements rigorous measures to protect user funds and provide a safe trading environment. As of 2024, the exchange has never suffered a large-scale hack, making it one of the safest choices for users looking to buy APT. Bybit is an ideal platform for users looking to buy APT, offering low spot fees (0.1% maker-taker) and high liquidity. The user-friendly CEX is well-suited for traders looking for a platform for all the bells and whistles due to its extensive leverage options and risk management tools. The exchange uniquely allows users to trade with up to 100x leverage on select assets, offering significant potential for profit amplification. It further supports trading safety with tools such as Bybit’s insurance fund, auto deleveraging, and the choice between cross and isolated margin accounts. These features collectively help manage and contain trading risks effectively. Bybit’s accessibility in over 200+ countries makes it a highly attractive option for global audiences. Uphold is an ideal platform for users looking to buy APT. The platform maintains a high level of transparency regarding its fee structure, ensuring users are fully informed about any fees and charges. Uphold’s comprehensive pricing model typically features a modest spread ranging from 0.4% to 1.0%. As well as supporting a diverse array of crypto, the platform offers users the opportunity to trade in precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum, and palladium. Furthermore, Uphold enhances the liquidity of these investments by allowing instant conversion into 27 national currencies and imposes zero custody costs. All assets, including precious metals and currencies, are spendable directly through the Uphold debit card. This combination of flexibility, low costs, and range of tradable assets makes Uphold a compelling choice for users looking to buy APT and explore other types of investment opportunities. CoinEx is an excellent platform for users looking to buy Aptos (APT) due to its user-friendly features and diverse trading options. CoinEx offers the advantage of no-KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements, allowing for quicker and more private trading. Users can effortlessly swap one cryptocurrency for another with a single click. The platform is equipped with a detailed interface for spot trading, making it accessible for both novice and advanced traders. Additionally, CoinEx supports margin trading, providing leverage ranging from three to 10x depending on the asset, which can enhance potential returns. This combination of privacy, ease of use, and flexible trading options makes CoinEx a standout choice for purchasing Aptos and other cryptocurrencies. The Aptos blockchain is an innovative layer-1 network developed by a number of the original creators of Meta’s abandoned crypto payment project, Diem. The blockchain’s stated aim is to become the safest and most scalable blockchain in the world. The blockchain employs a proof-of-stake (PoS) algorithm to validate and secure transactions across its network. PoS allows participants, known as validators or stakers, to verify transactions and create new blocks based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and are willing to “stake” as collateral. This system enhances network security while also incentivizing stakeholders to participate in the ecosystem. The web3-ready network supports both DApps and smart contracts, fostering trustless interactions and automating various processes. Additionally, Aptos employs innovative scaling solutions to ensure high throughput and low latency, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to supply chain management. Overall, the Aptos blockchain’s architecture and functionalities contribute to its efficiency, security, and scalability, positioning it as a leading force in the decentralized economy. "People are staying [on Aptos]… not only because of the tech, but because… for the first time in a while, a brand new programming language brings a new ecosystem that is more inclusive—that wants to help each other and wants to collaborate." Points were made @theempirepod 👏 https://t.co/0Q8rza0Jb5 The layer-1 blockchain implements unique technology design choices, including leveraging the Move programming language to bolster its code security and a unique Block-STM parallel execution engine to expedite transaction throughput potential. The use of Move as its native programming language ensures swift and secure transaction processing within its ecosystem. The Move prover, a formal verification tool tailored for smart contracts written in Move, enhances security measures by validating contract invariants and behaviors. This emphasis on security empowers developers with robust tools to safeguard their software against potential malicious threats, bolstering the overall integrity of the platform. Aptos launched on Oct. 18, 2022. Initially trading at 1 USDT, its value quickly soared by 10,000% after it was listed on the Binance exchange. This rapid growth ensured the coin quickly grabbed the attention of investors. The initial supply of APT at mainnet was 1 billion. The allocation was as follows: A majority of these tokens (410,217,359.767) are held by the Aptos Foundation, with a smaller portion (100,000,000) held by Aptos Labs. It is anticipated that these tokens will be distributed over a ten-year period: Do note that APT token distribution, as outlined above, is highly centralized, with staking reward unlocks that have no vesting schedule. This heightens the likeliness of venture capitalists dumping rewards on the open market, leaving unsuspecting retail investors caught short. As such, it is crucial to employ a comprehensive DYOR policy before choosing to invest in Aptos. Several crypto exchanges offer APT for purchase. This example will illustrate how to buy on CoinEx, a popular non-KYC exchange. 2. Fund your account: If your balance is zero, you’ll need to buy a cryptocurrency that can be exchanged for APT, such as USDT. 3. Find APT: Enter “APT” in the search bar at the top of the page. Click on it, and choose the “Swap” Option. 4. Enter the amount of USDT you plan to convert and click “Swap.” The system will automatically calculate the amount of APT you will receive based on the current market rate. Review all the transaction details carefully, confirm your information, and proceed to finalize the trade. The best platform for buying APT depends on individual needs and preferences. These factors include security, user interface, trading options, and geographical availability. Coinbase is celebrated for its strong regulatory compliance and beginner-friendly interface. Kraken provides extensive trading options and advanced security. Bybit is favored for high-leverage trading opportunities, whereas Uphold allows trading in cryptocurrencies and precious metals. Finally, CoinEx is preferred by those seeking privacy with its no-KYC policy. Note that each platform has its strengths and potential drawbacks. Remember to conduct due diligence and do your own research (DYOR) before investing in Aptos (APT). To buy Aptos (APT), you must create an account on a cryptocurrency exchange that lists APT, such as Coinbase, Kraken, Bybit, CoinEx, or Uphold. Once your account is set up and verified, you can deposit funds using bank transfer, credit card, or e-wallets. Aptos is listed on several major cryptocurrency exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken, Bybit, CoinEx, and Uphold. These platforms provide various trading pairs for Aptos, allowing you to trade them against cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and sometimes fiat currencies. The APT coin, the native cryptocurrency of the Aptos blockchain, was launched in October 2022. The launch followed significant interest and backing from various stakeholders in the cryptocurrency community, marking it as a notable event in the crypto calendar. Whether Aptos is better than Solana depends on specific criteria such as transaction speed, scalability, security, and developer community. Aptos claims high transaction throughput and scalability, but Solana is also renowned for its speed and efficiency. Aptos Labs, a team composed of former Meta (Facebook) employees who worked on the Diem blockchain project, is behind Aptos crypto. This team aims to create a highly scalable and usable blockchain, leveraging their experience developing blockchain solutions at a large scale. You can stake Aptos on exchanges that support staking functionalities, such as Kraken. This platform allows users to participate in staking directly through their trading accounts, providing a smooth way to earn rewards on holdings. However, offerings can change for other platforms, so it’s always a good idea to check the latest updates directly on each platform’s website or through customer support. The staking rate for Aptos can vary depending on the platform and market conditions. Generally, staking rewards are influenced by factors such as the total amount of APT staked on the network and the inflation rate set by the Aptos protocol. It’s important to check current rates on the platform where you intend to stake your APT. Comparing Aptos to Ethereum involves looking at transaction capacity, smart contract capabilities, and overall ecosystem. While Ethereum has a much larger and more established ecosystem with extensive developer support, Aptos offers promising technological advancements that could lead to higher throughput and efficiency. Each has its strengths, making them suitable for different use cases.

66::https://blockworks.co/news/blockchain-ai-misleading-narrative::Blockworks::article::What can blockchain do for AI? Not what you’ve heard.::Opinion: AI and blockchain put together aren’t actually that good at combating misinformation and improving privacy just yet.::In reality, many of the oft-touted uses for bringing blockchain and AI together aren’t actually all that useful Stokkete/Modified by Blockworks Industries everywhere are asking “What can AI do for us?” But the blockchain industry, known for challenging norms, is also asking the opposite question: “What can blockchain do for AI?” While there are some compelling answers, three narratives have emerged around this question that are frequently misleading and, in one case, potentially even hazardous. An expert panel at a recent Coinbase event concluded that “blockchain can counter misinformation with cryptographic digital signatures and timestamps, making it clear what’s authentic and what’s been manipulated.” This is true only in a very narrow sense. Blockchains can record digital-media creation in a tamper-proof way, i.e., so that modification of specific images is detectible. But this is a far cry from clarifying authenticity. Consider a photo of a flying saucer hovering above the Washington Monument. Suppose that someone has registered its creation in, say, block 20,000,000 of the Ethereum blockchain. This fact tells you one thing: The flying saucer image was created before block 20,000,000. Additionally, whoever posted the image to the blockchain — let’s call her Alice — did so by digitally signing a transaction. Assuming that Alice’s signing key wasn’t stolen, it’s clear that Alice registered the photo on the blockchain. None of this, however, tells you how the image was created. It might be a photo that Alice snapped with her own camera. Or Alice might have gotten the image from Bob, who Photoshopped it. Or maybe Carol created it with a generative AI tool. In short, the blockchain tells you nothing about whether aliens were touring Washington, D.C.—unless you already trust Alice to begin with. Some cameras can digitally sign photos to authenticate them (assuming their sensors can’t be fooled, which is a big if), but this isn’t blockchain technology. Model training is a data-hungry operation. The bigger and better the training data set, the better the resulting model. For many applications, training on private user data is essential. For instance, creating a good machine-learning model to diagnose medical conditions requires data from a population of real patients. Handling such highly sensitive data securely is a challenge. Some are trumpeting blockchain technologies as a solution. Blockchains, however, are designed for transparency — a property at odds with confidentiality. Proponents point to privacy-enhancing technologies advanced by the blockchain industry to address this tension — especially zero-knowledge proofs. Zero-knowledge proofs, however, don’t solve the problem of privacy in AI model training. That’s because a zero-knowledge proof doesn’t conceal secrets from whoever is constructing the proof. Zero-knowledge proofs are helpful if I want to conceal my transaction data from you. But they don’t enable me to compute privately over your data. There are other, more relevant cryptographic and security tools with esoteric names, including fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), secure multiparty computation (MPC) and secure enclaves. These can in principle support privacy-preserving AI (specifically, “federated learning”). Each has important caveats, though. And claiming them as blockchain-specific technologies would be a stretch. Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, has noted that bots are already performing transactions using cryptocurrency and tweeted that “AI and Blockchains are made for each other.” This is true in the sense that cryptocurrency is a good match for the capabilities of AI agents. But it’s also worrisome. Many people fret about AI agents escaping human control. Classic nightmare scenarios involve autonomous vehicles killing people or AI-powered autonomous weapons going rogue. But there’s another vector of escape: The financial system. Money equals power. Give that power to an AI agent and it can do real damage. This problem is the topic of a research paper that I co-authored in 2015/6. My colleagues and I examined the possibility of smart contracts, programs that autonomously intermediate transactions on Ethereum, being used to facilitate crime. Using the techniques in that paper and a blockchain oracle system with access to LLMs (Large Language Models) such as ChatGPT, bad actors could in principle launch “rogue” smart contracts that automatically pay bounties for committing serious crimes. Read more from our opinion section: How a smart contract gets away with murder: A review of ‘The Oracle’ Happily, rogue smart contracts of this kind aren’t yet possible in today’s blockchains — but the blockchain industry and crypto enthusiasts will need to take AI safety seriously as a future concern. They will need to consider mitigations, such as community-driven interventions or guardrails in oracles to help enforce AI safety. The integration of blockchains and AI does hold clear promise. AI may add unprecedented flexibility to blockchain systems by creating natural language interfaces to them. Blockchains may provide new financial and transparency frameworks for model training and data sourcing and put the power of AI in the hands of communities, not just enterprises.

68::https://cryptobriefing.com/euclid-unified-liquidity-layer/::Crypto Briefing::article::Euclid launches layer to connect liquidity across Cosmos, Solana, and EVM chains::Euclid's VLP model tackles DeFi's fragmented liquidity issue.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Euclid Protocol has announced today its shared liquidity layer that connects Cosmos, Solana, and Ethereum Virtual Machine-based ecosystems, powered by virtual pools created on Nibiru Chain. This effort is aimed at consolidating fragmented liquidity across the blockchain ecosystem. “We are excited to finally reveal the Unified Liquidity Layer, Euclid’s answer to the constantly growing challenge of fragmented liquidity,” said Georges Chouchani, founder and CEO of Euclid. “Euclid lays the groundwork for the next era of DeFi, aiming to provide users with a chain-agnostic modular experience. Its primary goals include ensuring scalability and fostering an efficient market environment.” The announcement points out the fragmented liquidity experienced by the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Despite showing nearly $136 billion in total value locked (TVL), these funds are scattered across DeFi. Euclid’s Virtual Liquidity Pool (VLP) model addresses this by virtually unifying liquidity without the need to physically move it, maintaining modularity and accessibility. The VLP allows for tracking and seamless movement of liquidity across all integrated chains. Moreover, those pools are created using Nibiru Chain as a Virtual Settlement Layer (Nibiru), creating a single source-of-truth ledger. This ledger connects all integrated blockchains, offering low slippage and fair pricing ecosystem-wide through the LiquiSync model, a framework that enables any chain or protocol to connect permissionlessly. “Euclid’s modular, accessible, and unified liquidity layer, powered by Nibiru Chain, is transforming the zero-sum nature of DeFi into a positive-sum game,” said Unique Divine, Co-Founder and CEO of Nibiru Chain. “This environment allows projects to synergize and scale together rather than just compete. Such synergy fosters collective advancements and competitive edges that could surpass those of established DeFi giants.” The reveal follows a successful $600,000 pre-seed funding round with the participation of Lavender Five, Andromeda, Nibiru Chain, Kahuna Network, and angel investor Tomoaki Sato. Last month, Euclid also secured a grant and liquidity backing to prime its pools for future use. These funds are earmarked for the development of the project’s architecture, business development, audits, and marketing efforts. Euclid’s roadmap includes extending its liquidity layer to encompass both EVM and non-EVM chains, leveraging protocols like IBC, CCTP, Axelar, and its own messaging protocol. The framework will be supported by EUCL, the native governance revenue share token, allowing holders to stake, receive protocol fees, participate in governance, and utilize the protocol’s treasury.

69::https://theconversation.com/when-china-and-other-big-countries-launch-cryptocurrencies-it-will-kick-off-a-global-revolution-128678::The Conversation::article::When China and other big countries launch cryptocurrencies, it will kick off a global revolution::Stand by for cryptocurrencies 2.0.::One of the hottest topics in cryptocurrencies is the prospect of major economies launching state-backed digital coins. China’s central bank recently accelerated plans for what is currently known as the Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP). It could launch within the next 18 months, while the European Central Bank is looking at something similar. Meanwhile, Russia has been working on a state-backed cryptoruble for several years, and Sweden has its e-krona project. Indeed, several countries have got there already: Senegal and the tiny Marshall Islands now have digital coins that sit alongside their existing currencies, while others such as Venezuela and Ecuador have tried but failed to gain traction. Make no mistake, these developments will completely change the international monetary system. Today’s system dates to the Bretton Woods conference of 1944, in which to create a stable trading environment the Allied nations agreed to peg their currencies to the US dollar and the US agreed to peg the dollar to gold. The dollar has been at the heart of the monetary system ever since, despite Bretton Woods being gradually replaced by free-floating exchange rates after the dollar/gold commitment was abandoned by the Americans in the 1970s. Today, around 40% of international payments and 60% of the world’s total foreign exchange reserves are in US dollars. The euro takes a more minor but still considerable proportion: over 30% of international payments and 20% of reserves. All other currencies are trivial by comparison. American financial dominance means that the Federal Reserve almost acts as the central bank of the world, since whatever its monetary policy committee decides to do with dollar interest rates has huge consequences everywhere. Together with the dollar’s dominance of the SWIFT international payment system, this was pivotal in maintaining the international monetary order for years by reducing transaction costs and speeding up globalisation. In recent years, however, the picture has changed. With heightened tensions between the world’s major powers, many commentators increasingly accuse the Americans of playing the system to their own economy’s advantage without proper regard for the consequences further afield. There are also serious concerns about the US using international payments as a political tool, for instance by leaning on SWIFT to exclude Iranian banks over the uranium enrichment row – despite objections even from the EU. Arguably, dollar dominance is now hindering the deepening of globalisation. Many countries are making moves that are changing this situation, however. The UK, France and Germany have set up INSTEX as an alternative means of trading with Iran, for instance, and six other EU countries have recently joined. There has been a massive rise in the number of bilateral agreements between central banks that allow two countries to swap currencies directly, a large number involving China. Meanwhile, a number of countries, including Germany and the Netherlands, have been repatriating their gold reserves from vaults in the US where they had long been stored. Yet by comparison, major sovereign digital currencies based on blockchain technology would be revolutionary. Blockchains are encrypted ledgers for storing information that are decentralised rather than being under any country’s or company’s control. When applied to international payments, this offers the prospect of much more transparent and cheaper transactions than SWIFT. It could cut the payments time lag from a couple of days to one second, and the cost from 0.01% to almost nothing. It will have the capacity to handle far higher volumes of payments, partly since they won’t require bank accounts or even internet access. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and XRP have been a good experiment in using blockchains for international payments. Yet when countries issue equivalents of their own, these will have even more advantages. They will be backed by states, and completely decentralised cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin will not be able to compete with this. While technological change has been incredibly fast in the information era, the system of international payments has lagged behind. But once sovereign digital currencies start taking off, this will suddenly change. Just like smartphones quickly eliminated most old cell phones, no countries will be able to reject blockchain payments for long. So while, for example, the US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin recently said that his country does not see itself launching a digital dollar in the next five years, there will be a moment when the political centre of gravity will shift and everyone will join the revolution. After the 5G network and the Internet of Things really mushroom in the next couple of years, it will be possible to replace the existing system even faster. This will be the beginning of a new international monetary era. Instead of passively accepting US dollars as settlement currency in international trade, buyers and sellers will be able to choose freely from a variety of currencies. We are also likely to see a series of new powerful regional currencies, along with opportunities for the currencies of small countries with high credibility and advanced financial industries. Countries and their central banks will be competing freely with one another in this market, knowing that if they implement policies that devalue their currency, international traders will just choose rival currencies instead. Beyond that, countries will form cryptocurrency unions to regulate currencies and platforms, standardise technology and maintain the stability of the system. New clearing systems will emerge, along with new financial products. In short, it will be a whole new user-centred financial ecosystem. Whenever there are innovations in payment methods, there always follows a surge in demand. China’s Alipay and WeChat Pay are good examples. More recently we are seeing similar explosive demand for the likes of Apple Pay and Amazon Go. Yet these are primarily domestic stories. Sovereign digital currencies should produce a surge in international trade and cooperation. There will be new economic growth as more small players join the global market and consumers enjoy a wider range of goods and services at lower costs. This may seem threatening to those who benefit from the existing system, but it will be more than outweighed by capitalising on what comes next. The question for different countries is whether they embrace change or try and defend the status quo. As Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg told American lawmakers in response to China’s DCEP plan, “while we debate these issues, the rest of the world isn’t waiting”. The sooner countries shift, the better placed they are likely to be for what lies ahead.::2019-12-12T12:07:54Z::Bitcoin, Blockchain, Bretton Woods, China, Cryptocurrency, Facebook, Iran, Libra, US dollar, international monetary system, stablecoin::Liang Zhao::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/306575/original/file-20191212-85367-1uu5emz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

The “move to earn” project brought $26 million in Q1, as previously reported. Move-to-earn, similar to play-to-earn, is a model whereby users are rewarded in cryptocurrency for their step count on the STEPN application. STEPN said it would leverage 5% of the profits to initiate a buyback and burn program for its native GMT tokens. It added that the buyback and burn process “may take a few weeks to complete” in order to avoid causing sudden price volatility. “In addition to the buyback and burn program, STEPN will allocate capital reserves to improve upon existing features and build out the team,” developers said. STEPN said the team had identified several areas where the company will deploy its earned capital in order to improve game play. These include security enhancements, anti-cheating mechanisms to prevent bots from earning GMT, building the developer and core team and seeking out partnerships and/or sponsorship opportunities. GMT prices rose nominally following the earnings release. The tokens traded at 85 cents at press time, and are down 71% from April’s all-time high of $4.11.

All You Need to Know::Solana's memecoin craze, Bonk, promises big gains. But can it bark its way to long-term success? Dive in, HODLers, and discover BONK's potential (and pitfalls) in 2024! ::Solana’s memecoin craze, Bonk, promises big gains. But can it bark its way to long-term success? Dive in, HODLers, and discover BONK’s potential (and pitfalls) in 2024! Bonk Coin (BONK), the meme-tastic token of the Solana (SOL) blockchain, has captured attention with its explosive growth and vibrant community. But with meme coins notorious for volatility, investors are left asking: Is Bonk Coin a good investment gem or a fleeting pump-and-dump? This guide dives deep into BONK’s intricacies, exploring its potential, risks, and price analysis to help you navigate the hype and make informed investment decisions. Buckle up for a journey into the wild world of meme coins, where barking loudly doesn’t always guarantee success. BONK is self-termed as the “first Solana dog coin for the people by the people.” But how does that reflect on the investment front? Let’s find out! BONK was launched amid low sentiment in the Solana community due to the FTX collapse. The initial development of the project kicked off in the middle of 2022. On December 25, 2022, half of the total supply of BONK was distributed as an airdrop to the community members of the Solana ecosystem. Over the short time it has been live, BONK has quickly gained momentum, attracting over 619,000 unique holders. Currently, it is listed on more than 30 exchanges. This demonstrates its appeal and growing influence within the cryptocurrency space. BonkSwap was launched in April 2023 as an independently owned automated market maker (AMM) decentralized exchange (DEX) platform to expand the ecosystem further. It has a current total value locked (TVL) of 2.8 million, as reported by DefiLlama. BONK has established itself as the third-largest meme coin in the cryptocurrency market, trailing behind the renowned Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), according to CoinMarketCap data. It also holds a position among the top 100 cryptocurrencies globally, highlighting its significant presence within the digital asset landscape. As of the latest figures, BONK boasted a market capitalization of $811,705,546. The 24-hour trading volume stood at $85,783,812, showcasing considerable activity and investor interest. In terms of its token metrics, BONK revealed a circulating supply of 63,333,513,043,628 tokens, accounting for approximately 67.72% of its total supply. Bonk Coin price history – Image via TradingView Since the onset of 2024, BONK has navigated through significant bearish challenges. It was initially undervalued in the first week of January. This suggested a potential for price appreciation. Subsequently, a surge propelled the price to its peak resistance at $0.000016 within the analyzed timeframe. However, this peak was followed by a rejection, initiating a downtrend that persisted until the price found support at $0.0000098, preventing further declines. As February progressed, there was another bullish attempt to elevate the price beyond the resistance at $0.000012. Despite crossing this threshold, the price failed to sustain above the higher resistance level of $0.000013, resulting in another dip. At the time of writing, BONK was trading at $0.0000128, edging closer to its support level at $0.000012. Over the past week, BONK’s price has declined by 1.4%, with an approximate 3% decrease observed in the last 24 hours. This indicated that selling pressure has intensified, potentially due to investors taking profits or reacting to broader market conditions. The asset’s performance was reflected in its indicators. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) exited the oversold territory in the second week of January, staying below the midpoint of 50 until after the first week of February. The February rally marked a positive shift in the market, evidenced by the RSI reaching 61.03 mid-month, coinciding with the price momentarily surpassing $0.000013. However, the RSI fell to 51.52 following the price decline, suggesting a weakening of bullish momentum. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator also showed interesting movements, entering positive territory as BONK tested its peak resistance. Despite a dip below zero by the end of January, it rebounded in February, with its current value at 0.08. The trading volume mirrored these market dynamics, starting low and increasing with the price surge in January. However, it declined following the downturn and, despite a slight recovery in February, has not reached the peak levels observed during the initial surge. The recent price rejection was again accompanied by a decrease in trading volume, indicating a cautious market sentiment. Should I buy Bonk Coin? – Image via TradingView Reviewing the overall performance of the BONK, it reached its all-time high (ATH) in December 2023, a milestone that aligned with its listing on Coinbase—a phenomenon often referred to as the “Coinbase effect.” This event significantly boosted the token’s price, underlining its legitimacy and expanding its visibility due to Coinbase’s extensive user base. Despite this peak, the token’s value has seen a decline since. However, the market still showed a hint of bullish sentiment. Over the last month, the token appreciated by approximately 10%, and it has seen an impressive year-over-year increase of about 1300%. This performance is considered favorable for the token. Looking ahead, as BONK approaches its current support level, the asset’s ability to sustain or rebound from this point could signal its short-term trajectory and investor confidence in its value stabilization or potential for recovery. Moreover, if the bulls can sustain a rally and break through the resistance level at $0.000016, BONK could potentially be closer to approaching its ATH once more. Achieving this would necessitate a significant shift in market dynamics alongside positive developments that could foster a strong buying sentiment within the market. For 2024, a speculative yet optimistic target price for BONK could be $0.00002, assuming the sentiment in the market shifts favorably. Conversely, a reversal to bearish sentiment could see the price falling back to its lowest support level, posing a critical challenge for the bulls to uphold the support level and avert further declines. While initially dismissed as a mere memecoin, BONK is actively building an ecosystem to increase its utility. This includes: Factors to consider before investing in BONK Since its debut, the project has been progressing with significant development and engagement from the core BONK contributors. You’re encouraged to delve into all the features this memecoin project offers by visiting the website provided. Among the standout features of BONK crypto are: BONKSwap:  BONKBot:  Another noteworthy accomplishment of this memecoin project is its expansion across various chains. As of the latest update, BONK is accessible on ten different blockchain networks, including Ethereum. Bonk stands out with several distinctive features: As we conclude our exploration of Bonk Coin’s potential as a long-term investment in 2024, it becomes evident that while it presents certain opportunities, it also carries inherent risks. Its technological innovations, market dynamics, and community support all play pivotal roles in shaping its trajectory. However, the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies underscores the importance of conducting thorough research and exercising caution. Ultimately, whether Bonk Coin is deemed a good long-term investment hinges on individual risk tolerance, investment goals, and the ability to adapt to the ever-changing landscape of the digital asset market. In the realm of cryptocurrencies, informed decision-making remains paramount, paving the way for a resilient and profitable investment journey.

To learn more on how we evaluate each piece of content, please proceed to our verification methodology page YakDAO offers opportunities for average retail investors to gain crypto and real estate exposure via recreational glamping properties. So, how does it work, and is this the start of a broader real estate tokenization movement? Read on to find out in this comprehensive YakDAO guide. Yak is an eco-friendly, recreational camping site. Campers enjoy luxury camping, also known as glamping. With a location currently in Brevard, North Carolina, Yak has plans to expand to other sites as its platform grows. Notably, Yak’s camping sites are sustainable. The aim is to positively contribute to the surroundings while minimizing environmental impact as much as possible. As a result, Yak offers a unique and comfortable outdoor experience for those who want to enjoy nature without sacrificing modern amenities and a luxury touch. YakDAO is a fractionalized investment platform built around Yak services. It is a recreational property decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Anyone can invest in YakDAO to earn profits from Yak. David Woodbury founded YakDAO and is the current CEO. Woodbury has over 10 years of experience as a C-level executive, creating startups, raising millions in venture funding, and, crucially, building outdoor recreation and property management software. This innovative platform also has a list of notable sponsors and integrations, many of which are recognizable within the crypto and traditional finance (TradFi) spaces. Some of these include: The nexus of the YakDAO platform is the democratized ownership of the recreational properties offered by Yak. This model allows the average retail investor to gain exposure to a traditionally gate-kept process. The entire investment process begins with the Treasury. YakDAO gathers contributions from community members who receive Yak DAO (YAKS) in return. The DAO purchases unique outdoor recreational properties using the funds collected from the community treasury. YakDAO then develops and maintains these properties for commercial and community use. The total supply of YAKS is 100,000,000. It is a governance token on the Arbitrum blockchain, which allows customers to take advantage of relatively low fees and fast transaction confirmation times. 💰💡 Let's look at the tokenomics of $YAKS and unveil how it maintains its value within the YakDAO ecosystem! 💰💡 📊 Tokenomics Total Supply – 100 00 000 Initial Market Cap – $236 500 Fully Diluted Market Cap – $5 500 000 TGE Token Price – $0.055 💹 Value Maintenance: $YAKS… pic.twitter.com/BC07qIMEPA There are three primary ways that the YAKS token maintains its value to support the YakDAO ecosystem: 30% of the revenue generated by the properties goes into YAKS buybacks to fund staking pools. A percentage will also be used to buy back and burn YAKS, further enhancing the token’s value. Where we see finance/funds being the barrier to tokenizing all aspects of real world assets, what YakDAO was able to do with real world tangible assets, was to buy a property for a DAO, monetize with short term rentals and create token buybacks tied to DAO revenue. We believe this model is scalable and has many potential use cases. Stakers will not only earn more YAKS but can also earn NFTs, win free nights at the glamping property, and attend YAK Fest. Furthermore, invitations to the Governance Committee will be extended to top-tier token holders. 1. Obtain a web3 wallet: Before purchasing YAKS, you must first obtain a web3 wallet. Download a wallet and follow the instructions to secure it. Login and switch over to the Arbitrum blockchain to begin purchasing YAKS. We’ve used MetaMask in this example. 2. Go to Uniswap: Uniswap is the official decentralized exchange (DEX) earmarked for purchasing YAKS. Any other DEX offering YAKS may be a scam, so it is best only to use official platforms designated by the YaksDAO team. 3. Select the YAKS token: Make sure you are on the Arbitrum blockchain and have some crypto (e.g., ETH) to swap for YAKS. Search for the official Yak DAO token address in the Uniswap search bar. 4. Buy Yak DAO (YAKS): Select the amount of YAKS that you would like to purchase. Press confirm. You have officially purchased YAKS and can stake, trade, or participate in YakDAO governance. The benefits of YakDAO are clear. It uses real-world assets (RWA) to give back to its community while simultaneously using its community to bootstrap the ecosystem, similar to a feedback loop. This helps to create a sustainable and self-sufficient decentralized organization. The project offers a clear roadmap for investors and has thus far (as of May 2024) delivered on its promises. With many big-name investors on board, YakDAO presents a credible offering that aims to return a profit to investors but also build community. Included in the project plans are in-person events, including annual YAK Fest meet-ups, bringing together the Governance Committee and top YAK stakers. YakDAO offers a clear opportunity. Its journey from concept to tangible achievements in less than a year since launch demonstrates the strength of the project’s trajectory. However, investors should be aware that crypto investments are high-risk. Tokenization comes with its own barriers, particularly regulatory uncertainty and an education gap. While the YakDAO project is widening accessibility for investors who may not otherwise consider or be able to invest in property, it must be highlighted that profits are not guaranteed with any investment. Finally, as of May 2024, the YAKS token can only be traded on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). While DEXs offer the benefit of anonymity, they are less secure platforms than their centralized counterparts. Moreover, they often offer lower liquidity than CEXs and a steeper learning curve for new users. This may counteract YakDAO’s mission to widen investment accessibility, at least in the short term. Real estate tokenization is set to revolutionize how we invest in and manage real estate assets, making them more accessible and efficient. The $YAK token offers investors a chance to invest in tangible, real-world assets while benefiting from the power of decentralized finance. The project represents one exciting tenet of an overall trend toward the democratization of such investments. Tokenization offers the sector increased liquidity and transparency, thus making it more accessible to the average person. In all, it’s clear that YAKDAO is at the forefront of an industry poised for massive growth. Remember to always DYOR, and never invest more than you can afford. YakDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization that governs the Yak platform. Yak is an eco-friendly recreational property that allows customers to enjoy the outdoors without giving up amenities. The DAO governs Yak and allows retail investors to benefit from the profits made from Yak. YakDAO collects money from the community to purchase and develop properties for glamping. Investors receive the YAKS token in return. Then YakDAO engages in market operations to further enhance the value of the YAKS token to incentivize holders to hold. YakDAO allows the average investor to gain exposure to investment activities traditionally reserved for accredited investors. Customers can have fractionalized exposure to investment properties without actively maintaining the properties. Furthermore, YAKS holders may have the possibility to earn NFTs, participate in governance, or utilize the glamping facilities. Yes, there are some risks associated with real estate tokenization. Due to the fact that cryptocurrency and blockchain technology are still niche sectors, there are some regulatory risks that may not be immediately apparent. The real estate market is also volatile and illiquid, therefore, allowing access to retail customers who may not understand expose them to some risks. To invest in YakDAO, you will need a cryptocurrency wallet and some cryptocurrency to purchase YAKS. The Yak DAO token is on Uniswap on the Arbitrum blockchain, so you will need Arbitrum ETH to buy some. You should only use the official YakDAO website to learn how to purchase YAKS. Yak has plans to purchase and develop more property in the future. There are also plans for a multichain staking pool and a Mogul Rewards Engine. Lastly, there are plans to launch YakLAND shares by 2025.

The NCLA, TBC, and Riot were granted a 14-day temporary restraining order late Friday, blocking the DOE and the Energy Information Administration from requiring bitcoin mining companies to hand over information as part of an emergency survey the EIA announced earlier this year. Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council, told Blockworks that the TBC remains “confident that we have a sound legal case.” “We’re concerned that a benign agency like the Energy Information Administration would be politicized in this way, it doesn’t bode well for other industries that potentially could fall out of favor with the administration and power,” he added. The complaint, filed last week, said that miners would be “irreparably harmed” by the survey, which demanded “confidential, sensitive and proprietary information.” “We will specifically focus on how the energy demand for cryptocurrency mining is evolving, identify geographic areas of high growth, and quantify the sources of electricity used to meet cryptocurrency mining demand,” Joe DeCarolis, administrator for the EIA, said in a statement last month. Read more: Crypto miner ire over EIA survey bubbles over to the courtroom The request, which was filed as an emergency order earlier this month, came after the cold snap that impacted parts of the US. “Given the emerging and rapidly changing nature of this issue and because EIA cannot quantitatively assess the likelihood of public harm, EIA felt a sense of urgency to generate credible data that would provide insight into this unfolding issue,” an EIA spokesperson told Blockworks back in early February. The NCLA, in a press release Friday, said that the EIA “appears to be responding to political pressure rather than a genuine ‘emergency’ implicating public harm.” In the order granting the TRO, the court wrote that it believed that the plaintiffs are “likely” to show that the justification for the emergency order request fell “short.” Before the order, the EIA — on its website and on X — clarified that it wouldn’t be enforcing the survey until March 22. Bratcher told Blockworks that TBC is “in this [fight] for our members and the industry and have no inclination to back away from what we think is a very correct cause.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

74::https://coinatory.com/cryptocurrency-news/ark-invest-and-21shares-amend-ethereum-etf-proposal-exclude-staking-feature-18929/::Coinatory::article::ARK Invest and 21Shares Amend Ethereum ETF Proposal, Exclude Staking Feature::ARK Invest and 21Shares have revised their Ethereum ETF proposal, removing the staking feature and shifting to a cash-creation model, aligning with SEC regulations and reflecting recent crypto ETF trends.::ARK Invest and 21Shares have revised their proposal for an Ethereum-based exchange-traded fund (ETF), opting to exclude the cryptocurrency staking feature from their plan. This adjustment was made following productive negotiations with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which have led the firms to adopt a cash creation and redemption model for the ETF. Initially, the firms had considered an in-kind redemption approach, where payments were made non-monetarily using Ether. However, the revised strategy now involves purchasing Ether in amounts corresponding to the order placed and depositing it with a custodian, which will facilitate the creation of ETF shares. In their latest regulatory filing on May 10, the section that previously suggested 21Shares would engage third-party providers to stake a portion of the fund’s assets was omitted. The earlier filing on February 7 had outlined plans for receiving Ethereum staking rewards, which were to be recognized as income generated by the fund. Eric Balchunas, a cryptocurrency analyst at Bloomberg, commented on the development via social media, noting, “ARK/21Shares has just filed an amended S-1 for their spot Ether ETF, updating it to feature only cash creations among other adjustments that align it with the recently approved spot BTC ETF prospectus.” Despite these changes, the filing retains comprehensive discussions on risks associated with staking, such as potential losses from slashing penalties, the temporary inaccessibility of funds during bonding and non-bonding periods, and the possible effects on Ethereum’s market price. The regulatory pathway for launching a spot Ethereum ETF has been fraught with delays. Following the pattern of their previously approved spot Bitcoin ETF, ARK Invest and 21Shares adjusted their application on February 8, signaling a shift toward a cash-creation model. This strategic pivot aims to align the Ether ETF closely with the SEC’s demonstrated regulatory preferences. As the SEC deliberates over various spot Ether ETF applications, including those from notable firms such as Invesco Galaxy, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, VanEck, and BlackRock, the crypto investment landscape is poised for potential shifts. These could enhance institutional involvement and the mainstream acceptance of Ethereum as an investable asset. Notably, other major players like Fidelity and Grayscale are incorporating staking features into their Ethereum ETF applications, seeking to capitalize on staking rewards within a regulated framework and offering investors additional income opportunities. However, U.S. legislators continue to scrutinize cryptocurrency ETFs, citing substantial investor risks. The SEC’s decisions in the coming weeks, particularly on the applications from VanEck and ARK Invest/21Shares, will be critical in shaping the future of cryptocurrency investments and regulatory practices. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

Share this article GameStop stocks GME triggered a circuit breaker today after a 54% rise, according to multiple reports. The volatility is tied to the return of RoaringKitty on X this Monday, after a nearly three-year hiatus from public apparitions, as reported by Crypto Briefing. $GME Paused due to volatility x4 (+90%) — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) May 13, 2024 Keith Gill, RoaringKitty’s real name, is largely credited for spiking the GameStop stock surge in late 2020. Gill worked as a financial analyst, became convinced that GameStop stock was undervalued, and shared this belief on X and YouTube using the handle RoaringKitty. Meanwhile, meme coins on Solana tied to GameStop and RoaringKitty show large leaps in price in the last six hours. GaemStap (GME), a meme coin surfing the trend of misspelling names, has risen by 1,957% at the time of writing. Kith gil (GIL), a token referencing RoaringKitty’s real name, leaped 1,960% in the same period. DeepF*ckingValue (ROAR), another one of Gill’s pseudonyms, jumped 1,264% and is also among the Solana meme coins with stellar rises in the past six hours. RoaringKitty (KITTY), however, shows the most significant leap of the bunch after showing an 11,045% growth.

76::https://theconversation.com/blockchains-first-revolutionary-product-could-be-online-id-128028::The Conversation::article::Blockchain’s first revolutionary product could be online ID::PayPal CEO Dan Schulman sees much more potential in blockchain ID than payments at present. He’s absolutely right.::In an interview, PayPal’s chief executive, Dan Schulman, recently discussed the prospects for blockchain – the encrypted, decentralised online ledger system that underpins Bitcoin and myriad other cutting-edge projects. While talking about blockchain’s potential for improving how people make payments around the world, Schulman said: Schulman was referencing a debate around payments that has been going for a few years. Without getting too technical, the main benefits of blockchain payments are that they are not controlled by middlemen, so there are no fees to pay; and transactions can’t be hacked and changed once they are on the ledger. But at the same time, they are not yet as quick at processing transactions as the traditional system – which as Schulman argues, is fast enough in any case. Regulation is also a major issue: people on either end of a blockchain payment are completely anonymous. This presents major issues for everything from money laundering to being able to reclaim payments if you accidentally credit the wrong address. In short, blockchain-based payments technology is very easy, but policy and regulation are much harder. For PayPal, which relies on the international banking system, there is still no contest. So why was Schulman much more bullish about the prospects for blockchain around online identity? Interestingly, it relates to one of the technology’s weaknesses in payments: anonymity. Much of the cybercrime that takes place results from the fact that we don’t know who we’re talking to. If we could all encrypt our online identities on blockchains so that we could completely trust who were are dealing with, it could overcome this problem. This isn’t just theory: there are numerous interesting developments in the offing. Take the UK government, which like many countries is increasingly moving interactions with the public online. This includes benefits, taxation and other services such as passport and driving licence applications. Yet like all governments, it faces a major challenge from the fact that citizens lack a unique online identifier. This is helping fraudsters to steal nearly £50 billion worth of government services every year in the UK. For this reason, the government is currently exploring blockchain as a potential solution. Another very interesting application, currently being explored by the UK government as part of the same project, is voting systems. Blockchains could provide a way of guaranteeing that every person queuing up to vote is who they say they are – or allow people to vote online, potentially with big benefits to turnout. Australia is looking at idea this, too, having recently trialled allowing voters in South Australia to identify themselves via blockchain technology for a minor council election. Meanwhile, New South Wales conducted a trial earlier in 2019 using a blockchain for identity verification based on people’s driving licences. It enabled participants to prove their identity and age for things like buying alcohol and gambling without the need for a physical ID card. The trials concluded that the technology is not yet mature enough, and that ID-verification can still be achieved better with current technologies. Nonetheless, New South Wales is going ahead with a new large-scale trial of a driver licence registration system based on a blockchain platform at the end of 2019, covering some 140,000 licence holders. Another country to watch closely is China. It sees blockchain products as a good mechanism for regulation. Given the huge market that China represents, if the government decides to sanction (or indeed mandate) the use of online identity underpinned by blockchain it will give a phenomenal boost to the technology. It also raises the worrying prospect of the government being able to monitor all the purchasing transactions of its citizens, were it to introduce a system in which it knew the identities of everyone on the blockchain. Numerous blue-chip tech companies are vying to be part of this blockchain ID future – pointing to the potential for a very big market. IBM is trialling the “alpha” version of IBM Verify Credentials, an ID system underpinned by blockchain technology aimed at both businesses and governments. If typical software industry production cycles for large projects are anything to go by, a market-ready product could be two to three years away. Microsoft, too, is developing blockchain identity systems based on its well established and very successful Azure cloud computing platform. Either of these systems could potentially provide the kinds of services that governments are starting to envisage. As for corporate clients, one application could be online retail, which attracts a lot of cybercrime. These systems might provide a reliable means of identifying a buyer to confirm they are authorised to pay. Presumably this would be underpinned by something akin to transaction fees per payment. Given the hundreds of billions of transactions that take place every day, the potential revenues could clearly be enormous. This is why companies like PayPal cannot stay on the sidelines. Blockchain hype or not, you don’t want to be the Kodak of this industry, if or when encrypted ID becomes the next killer online technology. Until governments of major economies around the world are prepared to significantly overhaul financial systems to accept cryptocurrencies as mainstream payment methods, the less glamorous business of taking an ID-verification cut from billions of payment transactions might be the safer bet. And since this is very similar to the fee-taking business model that made PayPal a giant, it will be very interesting to see what Schulman does next.::2019-11-29T15:15:48Z::Australia, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, Cybercrime, Global perspectives, IBM, Microsoft, PayPal, SWIFT payment system::Lucian Tipi::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/304449/original/file-20191129-95226-wwnfc6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=16%2C363%2C5407%2C2703&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
77::https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/07/11/coinflex-begins-arbitration-against-84m-delinquent-customer-flex-holders-in-focus/::CoinDesk::article::CoinFLEX Begins Arbitration to Recover $84M in Delinquent Debt::The trading platform also said it was speaking with depositors looking to help the business by “rolling some of their deposits into equity.”::Crypto trading platform CoinFLEX has begun arbitration for the recovery of over $84 million in debt owed by a “large individual customer” as part of a broader revival strategy. “We have commenced arbitration in HKIAC (Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre) for the recovery of this $84 million as the individual had a legal obligation under the agreement to pay and has refused to do so,” CoinFLEX said in a post on Saturday. “His liability to pay is a personal liability, which means the individual is personally liable to pay the total amount, so our lawyers are very confident that we can enforce the award against him.” CoinFLEX suspended withdrawals last month after a certain individual’s account went into negative equity during June’s market volatility, affecting its balances. The individual was revealed by CoinFLEX CEO Mark Lamb to be prominent crypto investor Roger Ver, a claim that Ver denied on social media. In Saturday’s post, CoinFLEX said it holds more than 26 million FLEX tokens – valued at over $7 million at current rates – in its inventory. It added that resuming trades would cause market volatility in FLEX's price, which would inadvertently affect the collateral positions of platform users. The company also said that it is looking to raise a significant amount of funds from investors, including by using customer deposits in exchange for equity. “There are a number of investors in this group of large depositors who have indicated that they may be in a position to help the business move forward if we can all find a workable solution,” the firm said. Recovering the delinquent debt, however, could help buffer FLEX prices and prevent a steep drop, CoinFLEX said. “We believe the recovery of the debt will help build confidence in and will help shore up the trading price of FLEX Coin,” it said. FLEX fell from $4.20 to $1.60 in late June as CoinFLEX went public with its losses, CoinGecko data shows. The lack of a swift recovery plan has added to the losses, with the tokens now down 94% in the past 30 days. Meanwhile, CoinFLEX said that it hopes to make 10% of customers’ balances available for withdrawal in the next week, adding that the arbitration process could “take up to 12 months.” Disclosure Please note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.

Ethereum [ETH] caught investors off guard as its price gained bullish momentum on the 17th of May. While the token’s price moved up, it broke above a bullish pattern that could allow the king of altcoins to touch $4k in the coming days or weeks. CoinMarketCap’s data revealed that ETH investors enjoyed profits last week, as the token’s price had surged by more than 6%.  Things heated up in the last few hours as ETH’s value increased by over 2.6% over the last day. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $3,108.31 with a market capitalization of over $373 billion. The bullish price action had a positive impact on the token’s social metrics, as its Social Volume remained high last week. Its Weighted Sentiment also entered the positive zone, meaning the bullish sentiment around ETH became dominant in the market. Source: Santiment Thanks to the price uptick, ETH broke above a bullish pattern that hinted at a price rise towards $4k. World Of Charts, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet highlighting that ETH broke out of a falling wedge pattern. The pattern appeared on ETH’s chart during the beginning of March, and since then, ETH has consolidated inside it. The tweet mentioned that the breakout could result in a 50% price rise, in turn allowing Ethereum to reclaim $4k once again. AMBCrypto then analyzed ETH’s metrics to see whether they support the possibility of it touching $4k anytime soon. Our analysis of CryptoQuant’s data revealed that ETH’s net deposit on exchanges was low compared to the last seven days’ average, signifying less selling pressure. Source: CryptoQuant Another positive metric was the Coinbase premium, as it indicated that buying sentiment was dominant among U.S. investors. However, not everything looked bullish for the king of altcoins. AMBCrypto’s look at Glassnode’s data revealed that ETH’s Network To Value (NVT) ratio registered a sharp uptick. A rise in the metric suggests that an asset is overvalued, hinting at a price decline. Source: Glassnode Ethereum’s Money Flow Index (MFI) also indicated a possible price correction as the indicator registered a decline. Nonetheless, the MACD displayed a bullish crossover. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also supported the bulls as it went northward. Source: TradingView Read Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2024-25 To see what targets it might reach if its bull rally sustains, AMBCrypto analyzed Hyblock Capital’s data. We found that ETH’s liquidation would rise near the $3.2k zone. A successful breakout above that would allow it to reach $3.5k in the coming days before it targets $4k. However, if ETH’s price turns bearish, then its value might plummet to $2.85k.

In response to those issues, many Argentinians have turned to crypto to safeguard their wealth and avoid prohibitive regulations that damage purchasing power. This guide explores the significant growth of cryptocurrency adoption in Argentina. We examine the underlying factors, their impact on various sectors, and the potential role of digital currencies in addressing the nation’s economic concerns. Since 2017, Argentina has experienced a significant upswing in crypto adoption. This was catalyzed initially by the first bullish surge in the crypto market. The momentum was further reinforced by subsequent crises in the country, each marked by high inflation and currency depreciation. Figures from the Crypto Council For Innovation suggest that one-third of Argentinians use crypto for everyday transactions in 2024. This level of adoption can be attributed to heightened awareness among the population regarding the advantages of decentralized financial systems. This is particularly the case in the context of preserving purchasing power during times of economic turmoil. The rise in cryptocurrency adoption has led to a flourishing ecosystem of crypto startups and companies in Argentina. From blockchain development firms to cryptocurrency apps and exchanges, these entities play a pivotal role in providing innovative solutions to the economic challenges faced by the population. As of 2024, a number of crypto startups are operating in Argentina, showcasing the entrepreneurial spirit driving the integration of digital currencies into the mainstream financial landscape. These companies include Ripio, SatoshiTango, Decrypto, Lemon, and Koibanx. Argentina’s strict currency controls since 2020 have led to a surge in the use of stablecoins. The asset class is a practical solution for individuals seeking to bypass traditional financial constraints. A 2023 report by Bitso, a Mexican crypto exchange, indicated that 60% of the crypto trading volume in Argentina comes from stablecoins, such as USDT or USDC. This underscores an increasing reliance on stable digital assets, pegged to less volatile currencies like the U.S. dollar, to navigate the challenges of accessing hard currency in a regulated environment. Cryptocurrency adoption in Argentina prompts a critical examination of whether digital assets could solve the nation’s persistent currency challenges. While challenges such as regulatory uncertainties and price volatility persist, the potential transformative impact of crypto on the economic landscape is undeniable. A wide sector of the population increasingly views crypto as a viable alternative to traditional banking systems. Recently elected president Milei supports this perspective. The Argentinian president, Javier Milie, also supports the use of crypto. This indicates a shift in government positions regarding the role of digital currencies in securing financial stability. The surge in cryptocurrency adoption in Argentina is backed by compelling statistics. These highlight the tangible impact of economic instability on choices made by individuals and businesses. The growth of crypto startups, the prominence of stablecoins, and the evolving public perception of digital assets all contribute to a dynamic landscape. As Argentina grapples with persistent currency challenges, the role of crypto is increasingly relevant, prompting a crucial discussion about their potential to reshape the nation’s economic future. Cryptocurrencies are gaining popularity in Argentina primarily due to the country’s high inflation and currency depreciation. Many Argentinians view digital currencies as a more stable store of value compared to the Argentine peso. Additionally, cryptocurrencies offer an alternative to traditional financial systems, which are often restricted by stringent government regulations. Stablecoins, which are digital currencies pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar, have become particularly popular in Argentina as a means to circumvent strict currency controls. They provide a more reliable way to preserve wealth and make international transactions without the volatility typically associated with unpegged cryptocurrencies. Approximately 60% of Argentina’s crypto trading volume comes from stablecoins. The rise in cryptocurrency adoption has led to the emergence of numerous crypto startups in Argentina, fostering innovation and entrepreneurship within the country’s tech sector. These startups not only provide solutions to economic issues through blockchain technology but also contribute to job creation and attract international investment. Companies such as Ripio, SatoshiTango, and Lemon are examples of how the crypto industry is influencing the broader financial landscape in Argentina.

80::https://blockworks.co/news/ai-monopoly-privacy-blockchain::Blockworks::article::AI has a monopoly on power and privacy. Blockchain fixes this.::Opinion: Crypto and blockchain can provide a safer, fairer, more human-centric collaboration between AI and the rest of us.::Crypto and blockchain can provide a safer, fairer, more human-centric collaboration between AI and the rest of us Artwork by Crystal Le Many Americans got their first glimpse behind the machine learning curtain when details of Amazon’s “Just Walk Out” technology went public. Instead of pure technology tallying up customers’ purchases and charging them when they left the store, the sales were manually checked by about 1,000 real people working in India. But these workers were the human-half of what most AI really is — a collaboration between reinforcement learning and human intelligence. The human element tends to be ignored in discussions of AI safety, which is a little disturbing given how much of an impact AI will likely have on our job markets and ultimately our individual lives. This is where decentralization, the inherent trustlessness and security of blockchain technology can play a major role. The Center for Safe AI identifies four broad categories of AI risk. As a start, there’s malicious use, in which users might “intentionally harness powerful AIs to cause widespread harm” by engineering “new pandemics or [using them] for propaganda, censorship and surveillance, or [releasing AIs] to autonomously pursue harmful goals.” A more subtle concern is the risk of an AI race, where corporations or nation states compete to quickly build more powerful systems and take unacceptable risks in the process. Unchecked cyberwarfare is a potential outcome, another is allowing systems to evolve on their own, potentially slipping out of human control; or a more prosaic, but no less disruptive outcome, could be mass unemployment from unchecked competition. Organizational risks with AI are similar to any other industry. AI could cause serious industrial accidents, or powerful programs could be stolen or copied by malicious actors. Finally, there’s the risk that the AIs themselves could go rogue, “optimizing flawed objectives, drifting from their original goals, becoming power-seeking, resisting shutdown or engaging in deception.” Regulation and good governance can contain many of these risks. Malicious use is addressed by restricting queries and access to various features, and the court system could be used to hold developers accountable. Risks of rogue AI or and organizational issues can be mitigated by common sense and fostering a safety-conscious approach to using AI. But these approaches don’t address some of the second-order effects of AI. Namely, centralization and the perverse incentives remaining from legacy Web2 companies. For too long, we’ve traded our private information for access to tools. You can opt out, but it’s a pain for most users. AI is no different than any other algorithm, in that what you get out of it is the direct result of what you put in — and there are already massive amounts of resources devoted to cleaning up and preparing data to be used for AI. A good example is OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which is trained on hundreds of billions of lines of text taken from books, blogs and communities like Reddit and Wikipedia, but also relies on people and smaller, more customized databases to fine-tune the output. Read more from our opinion section: What can blockchain do for AI? Not what you’ve heard. This brings up a number of issues. Mark Cuban has recently pointed out that AI will eventually need to be trained on data that companies and individuals might not want to share, in order to become more commercially useful beyond coding and copywriting. And, as more jobs are impacted by AI — particularly as AI agents make custom AI applications accessible — the labor market as we know it could eventually implode. Creating a blockchain layer in a decentralized AI network could mitigate these problems. We can build AI that can track the provenance of data, maintain privacy and allow individuals and enterprises to charge for access to their specialized data if we use decentralized identities, validation staking, consensus and roll-up technologies like optimistic and zero-knowledge proofs. This could shift the balance away from large, opaque, centralized institutions and provide individuals and enterprises with an entirely new economic system. On the technological front, you need a way to confirm the integrity of data, the ownership of data and its legitimacy (model auditing). Then, you would need a method of provenance, (to borrow a phrase from the art world), which means being able to see any piece of data’s audit trail in order to properly compensate whoever’s data is being used. Privacy is also important — a user must be able to secure their data on their own electronics and be able to control access to their data, including being able to revoke that access. Doing so involves cryptography and a security protection certification system. This is an advancement from the existing system, where valuable information is merely collected and sold to centralized AI companies. Instead, it enables broad participation in AI development. Individuals can engage in various roles, such as creating AI agents, supplying specialized data or offering intermediary services like data labeling.

In conversation with the Wolf of All Streets Podcast, Ardoino shared that despite market instability, Tether’s (USDT) circulation has expanded over the last year. The organization backs its currency with its own assets and capital, stemming from investments in US treasuries and short-term holdings managed with due diligence. He disclosed that Tether retains a considerable sum of $72.6 billion in US treasury bills. Ardoino underlined Tether’s commitment to upholding a stablecoin pegged at parity with the US dollar. In the final quarter of 2022, Tether realized a profit of $700 million. Despite close scrutiny from the public eye, Tether has navigated through various crises and major bankruptcies within the web3 domain, cooperating actively with law enforcement, including the Department of Justice, according to Ardoino. He reaffirmed the company’s dedication to offering a stablecoin that mirrors the US dollar one-to-one, without any current intentions for an initial public offering. Ardoino pointed out that over the preceding year, Tether’s USDT saw a rise in distribution, countering the volatility experienced by other digital currencies and stablecoins. Even in a bearish market, USDT’s market capitalization remains over $85 billion, ranking it the third-largest cryptocurrency globally. The recent financial success has prompted Tether to contemplate diversification strategies. The company is also aspiring to evolve into an all-encompassing tech provider, which requires expertise in key sectors such as energy, communication, and financial infrastructure, as he disclosed. Amid the recent buzz around stablecoins in the crypto sphere, Brian Brooks of Valor Capital Group, formerly Acting Comptroller of the Currency and CEO of Binance U.S., noted that stablecoins could reestablish the significance of the U.S. dollar in emerging markets. On the legislative front, July 27 marked a stride forward as the U.S. House Financial Services Committee progressed a bill to set up a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins, typically pegged to traditional assets like the U.S. dollar. This proposed law delegates to the Federal Reserve the task of stipulating stablecoin issuance conditions, while preserving state regulatory authorities’ powers. The bill underwent revisions earlier to alleviate concerns from some democrats about stablecoin issuers potentially skirting stringent regulations by operating under state jurisdictions. Meanwhile, the conviction of ex-crypto mogul Sam Bankman-Fried, implicated in misappropriating over $10 billion from clients and investors, underscores yet another disturbing episode in the crypto industry. Despite such incidents, there seems to be little momentum towards enacting clear regulatory standards. Last year, amidst significant downturns in cryptocurrencies and a wave of bankruptcies, U.S. Congress looked into regulating the sector. However, these efforts have moved slowly, especially given the current year’s challenges like global tensions, inflation, and the looming 2024 election. President Biden issued an executive order on cryptocurrency oversight, directing the Fed to explore the possibility of establishing a digital currency. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

82::https://cryptobriefing.com/sec-ethereum-etf-decision-loom/::Crypto Briefing::article::Fund managers predict SEC rejection of Ethereum ETFs next week::According to Coinbase's analyst, the SEC might reject spot Ethereum funds that allow staking in the near team. Why might the SEC decide to reject spot Ethereum ETFs? The SEC might not approve all spot Ethereum ETF applications at once: Coinbase::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article In contrast to the enthusiasm that preceded the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, reports over the past few weeks suggest that optimistic expectations for the Ethereum product’s approval have cooled down. Speaking with Bloomberg this week, Katherine Dowling, general counsel for ETF applicant Bitwise, said she anticipates rejection next week due to the lack of public activity typically seen before approval. “Most people are universally expecting a disapproval order,” Dowling noted. “You’re not seeing the types of public activities that you would see if there was going to be an approval.” In a CNBC interview, VanEck CEO Jan van Eck also predicted a likely denial. Next week, the SEC’s decision will confirm the fate of VanEck’s and Ark Invest’s filings. “We were the first to file as well for Ethereum in the US, and we and Cathy Wood, are kind of the first in line for May, I guess, to probably be rejected,” he stated. Unlike the frequent revisions made to spot Bitcoin ETF applications, there has been minimal back-and-forth between fund companies and the SEC regarding Ether ETFs. People involved in the talks with the securities agency reported that they had braced for a negative outcome. In the final month leading up to the spot Bitcoin ETF decision, the market buzzed with activity. Fund managers engaged in fierce fee competition, while industry experts placed bullish bets. Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have pegged the approval chances for spot Ethereum ETFs at a mere 25%. Seyffart recently expressed skepticism about a positive outcome, saying a nod is “not happening.” SEC Chair Gary Gensler has not been vocal about Ethereum ETF filings. However, he has clarified that the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs does not set a precedent for other crypto ETFs. Concerns about the classification of most cryptos as securities remain a major obstacle to compliance. According to Scott Johnsson, Van Buren Capital’s general partner, the SEC must provide a clear and detailed explanation if they reject spot Ethereum ETF filings. One potential reason for rejection could be Ethereum’s classification. The obvious purpose is to potentially deny on the basis that these spot filings are improperly filed as commodity-based trust shares and do not qualify if they are holding a security. — Scott Johnsson (@SGJohnsson) May 14, 2024 The SEC has not definitively classified Ether, and its decision might hinge on whether it considers Ether a security. If the SEC views Ether as a security, then spot ETFs wouldn’t be allowed under current regulations. The SEC’s alleged investigations into the Ethereum Foundation and the implications of Ethereum’s staking feature suggest a possible regulatory direction. Despite the uncertainty, Coinbase’s analyst David Han sees a 30% to 40% chance of approval by month’s end. He believes the correlation between CME futures and spot exchange rates, which was pivotal for Bitcoin ETF approvals, could similarly benefit Ethereum ETFs. However, like Johnsson, Han noted that the SEC might focus on Ethereum’s PoS mechanism as a reason for denial since regulations around staking are unclear. He suggested spot Ethereum ETFs enabling staking are unlikely to be approved. ARK Invest and 21Shares recently amended their S-1 form for the proposed spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) by removing the staking component. The move is considered an effort to align the filing with SEC preferences.

83::https://theconversation.com/sam-bankman-fried-sentenced-to-25-years-how-he-went-from-30b-crypto-ceo-to-prison-inmate-217026::The Conversation::article::Sam Bankman-Fried sentenced to 25 years − how he went from $30B crypto CEO to prison inmate::The downfall of the onetime multibillionaire holds lessons for investors and regulators alike.::The case of Sam Bankman-Fried, who was sentenced on March 28, 2024, to 25 years in prison, is emblematic of the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, in which vast sums of money can be made or lost in the blink of an eye. In early November 2022, the crypto exchange FTX was valued at more than US$30 billion. By the middle of that month, FTX was in bankruptcy proceedings. And less than a year later, on Nov. 3, 2023, its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, was found guilty of seven counts of money laundering and fraud, following a trial that featured less than a month of testimony and only about four hours of jury deliberation. D. Brian Blank and Brandy Hadley are professors who study finance, executives, corporate governance and financial technology. They explain how and why this incredible collapse happened, what effect it might have on the traditional financial sector and whether you should care. A million years ago, back in 2019, Bankman-Fried founded FTX, a company that ran one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges. FTX was where many crypto investors traded and held their cryptocurrency, similar to the New York Stock Exchange for stocks. Bankman-Fried also founded Alameda Research, a hedge fund that invested in cryptocurrencies and crypto companies. In the traditional financial sector, these two companies would be entirely separate firms, or at least have firewalls in place to avoid conflicts of interest. But in early November 2022, news outlets reported that a significant proportion of Alameda’s assets were a type of cryptocurrency released by FTX itself. A few days later, news broke that FTX had allegedly been loaning customer assets to Alameda for risky trades without customers’ consent and also issuing its own FTX cryptocurrency for Alameda to use as collateral. As a result, criminal and regulatory investigators began scrutinizing FTX for potentially violating securities law. These two pieces of news basically led to a bank run on FTX, and soon afterward, FTX, Alameda Research and 130 other affiliated companies founded by Bankman-Fried filed for bankruptcy. This left huge numbers of investors who bought cryptocurrencies through the exchange with no good way to get their money back. Within a month, Bankman-Fried was arrested and charged with wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy and money laundering by the Southern District of New York. In February 2023, additional criminal charges related to political donations were announced, followed by another indictment in March related to bribery. Bankman-Fried’s first trial began on Oct. 3, 2023, and largely focused on the “essentially unlimited” access to capital Alameda had on the exchange through a secret line of credit. In traditional markets, corporations generally limit the risk they expose themselves to by maintaining liquidity and solvency. Liquidity is the ability of a firm to sell assets quickly without those assets losing much value. Solvency is the idea that a company’s assets are worth more than what that company owes to debtors and customers. But the crypto world has generally operated with much less caution than the traditional financial sector, and FTX is no exception. About two-thirds of the money that FTX owed to the people who held cryptocurrency on its exchange – roughly $11.3 billion of $16 billion owed – was backed by illiquid coins created by FTX. FTX was taking its customers’ money, giving it to Alameda to make risky investments and then creating its own currency, known as FTT, as a replacement – cryptocurrency that it was unable to sell at a high enough price when it needed to. In addition, nearly 40% of Alameda’s assets were in FTX’s own cryptocurrency – and remember, both companies were founded by the same person. This all came to a head when investors decided to sell their coins on the exchange. FTX did not have enough liquid assets to meet those demands. This in turn drove the value of FTT from over $26 a coin at the beginning of November 2022 to under $2 by Nov. 13. By this point, FTX owed more money to its customers than it was worth. In regulated exchanges, investing with customer funds is illegal. Additionally, auditors validate financial statements, and firms must publish the amount of money they hold in reserve that is available to fund customer withdrawals. And even if things go wrong, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation – or SIPC – protects depositors against the loss of investments from an exchange failure or financially troubled brokerage firm. The crypto world lacks such guardrails. While the collapse of FTX and Alameda – valued at more than $30 billion and now essentially worth nothing – was dramatic, the bigger implication is simply the potential lost trust in crypto. Bank runs are rare in traditional financial institutions, but they are increasingly common in the crypto space. Given that Bankman-Fried and FTX were seen as some of the biggest, most trusted figures in crypto, these events may lead more investors to think twice about putting money in crypto. Though investment in cryptocurrencies has grown rapidly, the entire crypto market – valued at over $3 trillion at its peak – is much smaller than the $120 trillion traditional stock market. While investors and regulators are still evaluating the consequences of this fall, the impact on any person who doesn’t personally own crypto will be minuscule. It is true that many larger investment funds, such as BlackRock and the Ontario Teachers Pension, held investments in FTX, but the estimated $95 million the Ontario Teachers Pension lost through the collapse of FTX is just 0.05% of the entire fund’s investments. The takeaway for most individuals is not to invest in unregulated markets without understanding the risks. In high-risk environments like crypto, it’s possible to lose everything – a lesson investors in FTX learned the hard way. The trial of Bankman-Fried brought attention to the ever-evolving and complex nature of cryptocurrency regulation and oversight. At the conclusion of the case, Damian Williams, the federal prosecutor for the U.S. Justice Department, underlined the department’s dedication to fighting fraud, even in the relatively new crypto space. This case shows that the U.S. is willing to assert broad jurisdiction over financial crimes targeting its citizens, regardless of where the perpetrating company is based, which in FTX’s case was the Bahamas. Notably, this trial did not fall directly under the supervision of the Securities and Exchange Commission or other regulatory bodies, although pending civil cases from both the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, along with ongoing class-action lawsuits, underscore the complexities in regulating the cryptocurrency sphere. Despite a recent crypto crackdown by the SEC, the U.S. continues to lag behind other nations in establishing comprehensive crypto regulations. This is evident in the formal regulatory frameworks introduced by places such as the U.K. and the European Union. The International Monetary Fund’s call for comprehensive regulations further underscores the necessity for more robust regulatory measures within the crypto industry, hinting at a widening gap between the U.S. and much of the rest of the world.

84::https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/05/did-strong-bitcoin-etf-demand-kill-halvings-potential-bullish-rally/::CoinDesk::article::Did Strong Bitcoin ETF Demand Kill Halving's Potential Bullish Rally?::The much stronger-than-expected inflows into the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have already caused concerns about a supply shock in the bitcoin market, potentially taking away some of the impacts of the halving.::Bitcoin's (BTC) halving - which is often seen as a bullish catalyst for the price - may not be as positive as the market thinks, thanks to the approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETF). Halving, which occurs every four years, cuts bitcoin's supply growth by half, historically causing upward pressure on the price of the largest digital asset. The previous halving cycles pushed bitcoin to new highs, and this time, strong demand from the spot ETF may add even more fuel to the rally. “If we look at demand generally since the ETFs have launched, it has created tremendous supply shock already,” said Brian Dixon, CEO of investment firm Off the Chain Capital. “Once the halving occurs, and that supply is further reduced, it's only logical to think that the price will appreciate.” Read more: Bitcoin Halving, Explained On the surface, that may be the case as the demand from the funds has been significantly more than the 900 new BTC that are mined daily. And when that supply gets cut in half, it might create an even bigger pull on the prices. However, it might not play out the same way this time. The price of bitcoin had rallied 46% since Jan. 11, when the spot ETFs started trading in the U.S. The demand from these funds has been so strong that the price of the digital asset rallied to a new all-time high to keep up with the onslaught of bitcoin purchases. But the market may have gotten a bit ahead of itself in the hype. “This is the first time in which bitcoin broke its all-time highs before the halving, so there is a little bit of a concern that the ETFs have pulled demand forward and that maybe we're going to linger where we are for a little bit," said David Lawant, Head of Research at FalconX. Anthony Anderson, founder and CEO of Param Labs and Kiraverse, echoed this sentiment. "Bitcoin ETFs preempted the impact of halving on supply by massively acquiring BTC since the beginning of the year." Also, halving might not affect the ETF flows either due to the already strong demand from the investors, at least not in the short term, according to Bloomberg Intelligence's ETF analyst James Seyffart. Read More: Bitcoin Could Slump Around Reward Halving Time, Arthur Hayes Says "We know many miners use OTC desks to offload their BTC and the ETF issuers also use OTC desks to obtain their Bitcoin as flows come into the fund. So theoretically the potential halving of miner bitcoin sales could mean that ETF inflows will have a greater impact on the underlying market. But for the last few months the ETF inflows have vastly exceeded anything the miners provided from operations," he said. "So if it does have an impact it’s unlikely to be anything extremely impactful in my view," Seyffart added. This is not to say that halving won't be a significant catalyst for bitcoin and the ETF flows in the long term. After all, the success of the ETFs seems to be closely correlated to the price of BTC and vice versa. The halving may even accentuate the appeal of bitcoin as an asset class to institutional investors. “I think the halving is going to be one of the best things for bitcoin since the ETFs launched,” said Bob Iacchino, co-founder of analytics firm Path Trading Partners. “At its core is an inflation protection mechanism and inflation is ramping back up.” In fact, the hype around halving might help bitcoin bring it in front of many investors looking for alternative assets to hedge against the global macro volatility. "This [Halving] is happening at a time when folks are somewhat queasy about the risk that Bitcoin hedges against," said Lawant, pointing out that many investors are starting to pay more attention to how to protect their portfolio against any significant change in global economy and having spot ETF and an asset class with shrinking supply "would be positive for ETF flows." This supply shortage might also lead to a longer-term impact on the ETF flows as it will impact bitcoin's "marginal supply into perpetuity," said Seyffart. He added that, even though the impact of the marginal supply from ETF inflows in the first three months has been much higher than the halving can have, the slashing of the supply of BTC is "permanent and goes into perpetuity." Whatever the case may be, the market may need to brace for volatile short-term trading for bitcoin and perhaps for the ETF flow after the halving, said Anderson, noting that in the long term, net flows for the funds should come in at a similar pace that is seen currently.

Despite its license, this casino didn’t lose out to other casinos on this list, and it may be even better than some. But that’s up to the players to decide. With this, we’ve come to the end of this list. Now, let’s explore the most popular online casino games in Australia. Just as much as Australia is known for its tropical beaches that are filled with wildlife, its residents are known for their love of gambling, which is spread across casino games and betting on sporting events. This led to the establishment of BetStop Australia, which is a self-exclusion program created to battle the rising gambling addiction in the country. However, this didn’t reduce the people’s love for casino games as there are thousands of them out there on the internet begging for them to be explored by Australians. But what are the most popular casino games in the country? Let’s find out below. Blackjack In the world of high rollers, Australians are sure not to lag. Blackjack is one of the most popular choices for the residents of the country as it usually challenges them to adopt several strategies before they can claim a significant win in this kind of game. Blackjack is a casino game that sees players seek to claim a hand closer to 21 but higher than the dealer’s hand. The number must not be exceeded. While Blackjack is known to be a simple game with fewer rules, it seeks the use of an outstanding strategy to claim winnings against the dealers. Many strategies can employed for this game including card counting to improve their chances of winning. This is a game that is known for its competitive edge which lets players display their decision-making abilities to increase their odds of winning. To Australian players, Blackjack comes in different varieties like the classic Blackjack, Pontoon and European Blackjack. There is also live dealer Blackjack which has been gaining some popularity in the world of online casinos as it offers an immersive casino experience due to the presence of real-time professional dealers and players. This makes the game of Blackjack even more attractive to Australians and spiked it up to one of the most popular casino games in the country. Poker Poker is another widely popular online casino game in Australia. Poker can be regarded as both a card and table game, and it is quite popular both offline and online. It is one of the best casino games you can find on the internet. It is a game that relies on skill, strategy and luck before a player can secure a win, which is usually huge. In land-based casinos, playing poker is seen as a way to enjoy social interactions with intellects. Just like Blackjack, Poker is also available in different variations. The most popular variation of this casino game is the Texas Hold’Em, Omaha, a Seven-Card Stud. In online poker, players are allowed to take part in cash games or tournaments which allows them to win prizes in different sizes. The online poker room in many online casinos gives players the ability to against each other from anywhere across the globe, and this played a role in its popularity not only in Australia but also across the world. There are freeroll tournaments in pokers which lets players partake without staking their cash but gives them a chance to win some real money. Roulette Roulette is one of the most popular online casinos accepted by Australians, and it has been around for a long while. Spin the wheel to get a wheel, that’s what the roulette game is about. It is a game that involves a spinning wheel divided into numbered pockets and a small ball that is the decider of the winning number or colour. The online roulette is available in different versions which includes American, European and French roulette. The European and French version features a single zero pocket with better odds for Australians when compared to the American variation which comes with two zero pockets and lesser odds. Online roulette is quite easy to understand, and there are not many rules you need to be familiar with to be able to claim winnings. But you should know that some strategies can be followed to increase a player’s chances of winning. So, you should always research to ensure you’re not losing out on anything. Online Slots Slots are arguably the most popular online casino games not only in Australia but also across the world, and they are numerous in numbers. They usually take up the majority of space in a casino library than every other casino game. Online slots, also known as slot machines, come in a wide variety of themes, high-quality graphics and immersive gameplay experiences. It is also the simplest casino game ever to exist since it was discovered. Online slots are available in different themes that are tailored to all kinds of players. If you’re a soccer fan, you’ll find football-themed slots, if you’re a lover of tennis, you’ll discover many tennis-themed slots that you’re not even aware of their existence. There is a slot theme for almost everything you can think of from finance to city girls, video games, space, music, sports, food, business and many more. Its simplicity is probably one of the reasons Australians love this casino game, as well as the impressive gameplay experience it offers. Baccarat Baccarat has also been able to move the hearts of Australian players over the years, as it is known to be a simple card game. It is a game that revolves around a target that needs to reach a hand total of nine with just two cards. Drawing its similarity from Blackjack, Baccarat is also a comparing card game but it involves just two hands; the banker and the player. It is one of the oldest casino games to have existed as some believe it dates back to the 19th century, which is even before the first online casino made its appearance. Bingo This classic game has captivated audiences for generations, offering a thrilling combination of luck, strategy, and communal fun. Bingo revolves around matching numbers on your individual Bingo card with those called by a designated caller. The winning formula is simple yet exciting – complete a designated pattern (usually a row, column, or diagonal) on your card first, and shout “Bingo!” Throughout the game, numbers are randomly selected. Traditionally, these numbers were drawn from a bingo cage containing numbered balls. Technology has streamlined this process, with Electronic Random Number Generators (RNGs) now widely used in most bingo halls. While the classic format remains a favourite, Bingo boasts a surprising range of variations. From the fast-paced excitement of Horse Racing Bingo to the social atmosphere of Table Bingo, there’s a version suited to every preference. Electronic Bingo offers a high-tech twist, utilizing electronic devices instead of paper cards. The easy-to-understand rules and the minimal equipment required make it a game for everyone. The communal atmosphere, the anticipation of each number called, and the thrill of a potential win all contribute to Bingo’s enduring popularity. When it comes to picking the best online casinos in Australia for your real money ventures, there are several things you need to look out for including the library of casino games. Below, we will discover everything you need to be on the lookout for when picking the one best suited for you. Licensing & Security Before picking an online casino in Australia, one of the deciding factors people check out for is the licensing of the online platform. The online casino you’re picking must have a gaming license from a reputable gaming authority like the Curacao Gaming Authority, the United Kingdom Gambling Commission, or the Malta Gaming Authority. A gambling license is vital for every online casino as it assures players of its security and the fairness of each platform. A license from a reputable gaming authority means that an online casino is being regulated by them, and they’ll have to follow all rules that ensure players’ protection and several other things. Should a dispute arise between a player and an online casino, the gaming authority can step in for the player to help solve the issue. If an online casino doesn’t have a license, you should stray far away from the platform. Library of Casino Games Another thing Australians look out for is the availability of casino games, most online casinos are known for their extensive library of games. The average online casino with licensing from the Curacao Gaming Authority, in most cases, has thousands of casino games housed in its library. In the aforementioned list of best casinos in Australia, most of them host over 4,000 casino games in their libraries, which includes online slots, blackjack, baccarat, poker, craps, and live dealer games. Some even go as far as offering a sportsbook that allows players to place wagers on their favourite sports, players and teams. If you can find popular titles at an online casino, then you should probably be picking them. Reputable Software Providers What good is an extensive library of casino games if they can’t be played in high definition? While most online casinos are known for having thousands of games in their libraries, it is important to ensure that these games are provided by reputable software providers. Reputable software providers, also called game suppliers, are known to always provide high-quality casino games that come with impressive sound effects. They are also known for their provably fair games, which are games their transparent and fair. These games allow players to see how the outcome of each round of the game came to be. These software providers include Microgaming, Play’n Go, Yggdrasil, Playson, NetEnt, Evolution, Pragmatic Play, Ezugi, Vivo Gaming, Real Dealer, and Playtech. Ensure the online casino Australia you’re picking is partnered with at least three of the mentioned software providers in this paragraph. Bonuses & Promotions In the rise of the online casino industry, bonuses and promotions played a vital role in this sector. It quickly became a marketing strategy for online casinos to draw in players from across the world. Ever since then, bonuses and promotions have become an integral part of all online casinos spread across the internet, and online casinos Australia are no exception to this. However, bonuses and promotions vary depending on the online casino. Some online casinos offer bonuses with less stringent wagering requirements than others, and some don’t employ the use of requirements for their players. Always pick an online casino with less strict rules for its promotions and bonuses, or you can just pick the ones best suited to you. Mobile Friendly Before picking an online casino in Australia, you should always check for its mobile friendliness. It’s even better if it has a mobile app that can be downloaded straight to your phone. Mobile friendliness means you can indulge in your favourite casino game from anywhere without having to bring your computer with you. You’ll be able to play your favourite games directly from your phone without the hassle. Mobile compatibility is another reason Australians love the online casinos listed earlier in this article. Customer Support The availability and the speedy response of the customer support of an online casino should also be considered when you’re picking an online casino. It is important to players in Australia. Should a player have questions that can’t be found in the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), they’ll need to contact customer support to give answers to the questions. Most online casinos usually have different methods for contacting their support center; live chat, email address, and toll-free lines. They should be available 24/7. Ensure this is the case for any online casino you’re picking. Online Casino Reviews The last thing you need to check out before deciding on an online casino is to know what people think about it. There are probably hundreds of reviews on a single online casino. Simple research on Google and Bing will let you understand how people view any online casino. You’ll get to know how a platform treats its players, how fast the withdrawal time is, and the previous disputes that have happened. This will help you decide on the best online casino to pick in Australia. It is a major factor to consider when picking an online casino. Conclusion In this article, you’ve been able to explore the best online casino in Australia, as well as the popular casino games being played in the country. You should have no trouble picking any from the aforementioned ten. However, you must carry out your research to better understand the best one suited for you as every player has a different taste.

Futures contracts are standard agreements to buy and sell a specific cryptocurrency at a predefined price at a set time in the future. While spot trades are executed immediately and are concerned with ownership, futures trading is all about speculating on the future price of a token. With futures came controversies: #BREAKING: Is the US covertly trying to BAN crypto?

Both play significant roles in cryptocurrency trading but serve different strategic purposes for traders on platforms like Binance (where they are listed under the same tab). Futures are a tricky market, especially for beginners. My take is to walk before you run. Cut your teeth on spot markets before introducing leverage to the equation. When or even if you start adding leverage, keep leverage low. Remember high leverage equals high risk, and low leverage equals lower risk. During a sideways market, the temptation will be to leverage up and go hard, but perhaps more patience is needed. Wait for the market to come to you. Sometimes, less is more, and you don’t need to be trading every tiny move in the market. If you are interested in Binance crypto futures, it is important to understand how they work before you begin trading. On Binance, you can trade quarterly futures (delivery) or perpetual futures. Trading on the world’s largest crypto exchange has its own set of benefits, especially when it comes to choices. Here is how each futures trading type works fundamentally: Binance offers futures contracts that expire quarterly — in March, June, September, and December. These are fixed-expiration contracts and do not come with the baggage of funding fees. The contracts settle on the expiration date and are ideal for traders who prefer hedging and speculating with a clearer timeline. Binance still doing between $15b to $45b in trading volume PER DAY from their futures trading ONLY👀 Roughly 20x the daily volume of ALL of decentralized perps combined (dYdX, GMX, Synthetix etc.)📊 Protocols building a CEX-like trading experience therefore have massive upside.… pic.twitter.com/EI75l961em Perpetual futures contracts have no expiration date. This way, traders can hold onto positions indefinitely on the condition that the margin is managed correctly. Plus, perpetual futures traders must also keep track of the periodic funding rates. These contracts are flexible and help navigate the market changes better. Quarterly and perpetual futures settled in stablecoins like Tether are termed USD-margined futures. The stability quotient is pegged to the USD. In 2024, Binance offers USDT and even USDC-settled futures contracts. These futures contracts are settled in the crypto that the contracts actually represent. For instance, a Bitcoin-specific futures contract is settled in Bitcoin. Now that we’ve covered some of the key information, let’s dive into the practical steps. Here’s how to trade crypto on the Binance Futures platform. Before you can start trading crypto futures on Binance, you must take the following steps. Keep track of orders where you can get better deals by utilizing the exchange’s native BNB crypto. Here’s what the entire Binance Futures crypto trading process looks like: Once all the order elements are handled, you must review them and confirm the trade to place an order. Did you know? Open interest plays a crucial role in futures trading. Open interest refers to the outstanding futures contracts that have not been settled. For traders, tracking open interest is important because it indicates the liquidity and depth of a particular market. High open interest suggests that many players are involved, which generally leads to better price discovery and more stable markets. Note: You can trade Binance Futures for all the top crypto assets, even via the mobile application. You should, however, choose Binance Pro and not Binance Lite for margin trading in the crypto derivatives market. The Binance crypto exchange allows you to play around with order types, especially when implementing adequate risk management tools. Here are the types that can help you stay on the safer side of the trade: This feature adjusts the stop price at a fixed percent below the market price as the market price rises. If the market price dips, the stop loss price doesn’t change. The market order is submitted when the stop price is hit. Futures trading allows you to trade with leverage, meaning you can open positions larger than your existing capital. Binance offers leverage from 1x to 125x. It’s crucial to understand that higher leverage increases both potential returns and potential risks. You can play around with the dashboard settings to choose the perfect risk-reward ratio for your trades. Here is how you can set these on Binance specifically: Besides the mentioned advanced risk management strategies, you can also set futures-specific trading preferences. These include selecting and customizing the following elements: Trading crypto futures on Binance needn’t be hard. You can even use trading bots specific to platforms like CryptoHopper, 3Commas, and Coinrule. And while each one is good enough, Coinrule and 3Commas are the easiest ones to use and test, courtesy of the following features: Even experts believe in the potential of AI bots: However, there are many interesting ways that AI and crypto could intersect in the future. • Crypto-powered reputation systems for GPU renting • AI bots for trading & predictions • Blockchain-based incentives to train AI • Digital media authentication https://t.co/7TnkzJXiB8 But wait, why would you want to use bots even? Plus, you can connect Coinrule to Binance and start slow, using the demo account first. Here is a quick guide to help you make sense of using Coinrule for trading Binance Crypto Futures: (The API process is rather uniform for most trading bot ecosystems) Here are some of the examples of how your trades will be executed: This is the level of automation you can achieve using trading bots. “One of the downsides of using bots is that you’ll be paying more trading fees because you’re trading more actively.” So, how do all these elements of the Binance Futures trading platform work? Here is an example: If you have previously traded crypto futures, here are some of the more advanced elements found on Binance to help you take your trading performance to the next level: Here is a quick take on reading funding rates: “Bitcoin funding rate premium has heavily dropped off over the past 24 hours. That’s a good thing, especially if you are a spot buyer. This happening in a consolidation around prior ATH could fuel the next leg.” Automate your trades with #Binance Futures trading bots. Set your price levels, sit back, and let the bot do the rest! Get started ➡️ https://t.co/en7LBGp1oY pic.twitter.com/OCtTeOx14v These strategies and sections work regardless of the USD-M and Coin-M futures trading form you choose. Note that to get the most out of BBO and queue orders, you need to understand how an order book works with crypto futures trading platforms. As mentioned earlier, the crypto derivatives market on Binance extends beyond Bitcoin. You can trade all the top coins, with varying leverage, choice of settlement — delivery or perpetual, and the choice of an asset to settle in — USDT, USDC, or the contract-specific coin. Binance offers one of the best trading experiences for crypto futures. Yet, if you are concerned about trading regulations, geographical restrictions, and other elements, here are a few Binance alternatives to consider: Futures trading for beginners can be tricky. However, if you’re still keen to get started, trading crypto using Binance Futures is an excellent option, as the dashboard itself is self-explanatory and beginner-friendly. Regardless of your expertise and skill level, it is important to stay aware of the regulations and risk management techniques in order to keep your account and funds safe. However, if you are risk averse and just starting your crypto journey, it is advisable to focus on more traditional investment vehicles, such as crypto ETFs, rather than diving straight into the riskier world of futures. Yes, Binance Futures is a reliable trading option for beginners. Futures trading for beginners can be tricky if the platform is too complex or lacks the right educational tools. Binance solves this by offering a minimal approach towards the crypto derivatives market and leverage trading — the fundamental elements of futures contracts. Note that regardless of the platform you choose, futures are relatively complex financial intruments. Do not trade futures without a solid understanding and plan. To make $100 a day trading Bitcoin futures on Binance with BTC priced at $60,000, employ a strategy with careful risk management. Begin by setting a daily goal of $100 with a $10,000 account, using 10x leverage. Risk 2% per trade ($200), buying BTC at the supposed price of $60,000, setting a stop-loss at $59,500 to limit losses to $200, and aiming for a profit target of $60,300 to gain $150. This approach uses a 1:1.5 risk/reward ratio, requiring precise execution and active monitoring to adjust stop-loss and take-profit levels as needed. Note that this is theoretical. Profits are never guaranteed. To trade in crypto futures, you need to first start by creating an account. Then, you need to fund the futures wallet, learn the basics of futures trading, the concepts of leverage and margin, and start analyzing elements like the funding rate, open interest, and more to kickstart the proceedings. You can set a take-profit order at a specific price. This way, you can lock your profits. This aspect is necessary in the world of cryptocurrency derivatives trading as you can quickly book profits by closing the contracts before the market turns against you.

According to the Solana explorer, transactions per second (TPS) on Solana went from roughly 1,900 to over 3,000 minutes following the airdrop. Average ping time — the time between the initiation and completion of a process — has almost tripled, from roughly 20,000 milliseconds to over 60,000 milliseconds. Jupiter is one of the largest liquidity aggregators on Solana, rivaling Uniswap v3 for trading volume. According to Coingecko, Jupiter currently has a 24-hour trading volume of over $688 million while Uniswap v3 on Ethereum currently has a 24-hour trading volume of a little over $790 million. This Genesis airdrop will allocate 1 billion JUP tokens to community members. Four future airdrops will occur on the same date over the next four years. Read more: Understanding Jupiter’s tokenomics ahead of its first airdrop The initial airdrop will be given to engaged users, and an estimated 955K wallets who have interacted with Jupiter before Nov. 2 will be able to claim eligibility.

This solution will utilize technology to ensure the security and authenticity of the stored data. The plan is to send a payload containing “data cubes” to the Moon in February 2024. Once the data reaches Earth it will be verified and authenticated using blockchain technology. If this project is successful the blockchain technology used will provide proof of human presence on the Moon during NASAs upcoming manned mission called Artemis 3 scheduled for 2025. Before that mission takes place Artemis 2 will be launched in November 2024. This mission will involve orbiting the Moon with four astronauts on board before returning to Earth. It serves as a rehearsal for the anticipated lunar landing that will happen during Artemis 3. Lonestar and the Isle of Man are working together on this groundbreaking initiative to establish long lasting lunar storage systems during NASAs Artemis missions. These systems will be powered by energy and won’t require any additional infrastructure. According to a report from BBCs Science Focus this experiment involves creating ” franking” or digital stamps that are stored within these lunar data cubes. Once these stamps are placed on the Moons surface their integrity and completeness will be confirmed through verification here on Earth. Thanks to blockchains nature future astronauts who land on the Moon can use these data cubes for various purposes such, as lunar check ins. Interactions like these can be verified using technology, which could potentially address any future conspiracy theories surrounding Moon landings. Although NASA has faced difficulties in countering conspiracy theories related to lunar missions between 1969 and 1972 it is anticipated that blockchain will provide indisputable proof, for upcoming human lunar landings. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

89::https://cryptobriefing.com/base-trading-surge-jojo-dex/::Crypto Briefing::article::Base records 212% increase in perpetual trading volumes::JOJO DEX's dominance in Base's ecosystem signals a strong user engagement trend.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Base is the blockchain with the most significant monthly and weekly perpetual trading volume growth among the 10 largest chains in total value locked (TVL), according to data aggregator DefiLlama. This weekly jump can be attributed to the recently launched perpetual decentralized exchange (perp DEX) JOJO, which has presented a nearly 75% growth in trading volume for the past seven days.  Moreover, JOJO dominated 61% of Base perpetual trading volume over the last 24 hours, surpassing $95 million. Jotaro Kujo, JOJO’s co-founder, shared that there are “quite a lot of real users” trading perpetual contracts.  “I believe someone is farming the airdrops since every project that doesn’t have launched a token will make people somehow believe that they will give airdrops to the early users. But from our market-making results, they are not just wasting their trading fees, they are earning money. Farmers’ activity is just opening and closing positions, paying a lot of gas fees and trading fees to make their total trading volume a big number,” he explained.  Kujo adds that real users are not seen just on JOJO’s platform but on the Base ecosystem as a whole, and that’s why the team chose their infrastructure to build a perp DEX. Despite Arbitrum and Blast having a larger derivatives volume, Base offers engaged users, a significant amount of TVL, and fast growth, he adds.  “Most of Base activity is real. People are there to use it, not just farm it. Another thing we really like, and we think can create a loyal user base in the long term is Coinbase itself. They put a lot of work into making Base easy to use: they have a very strong infrastructure, including sequencers, the bridge, and also oracles. They also made a lot of things to connect Coinbase to Base.”  Furthermore, JOJO is currently only available on Base, and Kujo revealed the team is not planning to go multichain right now. Despite internal discussions among the team, JOJO will focus its development on Base and build a relationship within the ecosystem.  “We want to make the product useful, focus on a very narrow user base to pay a lot of attention to it, and it is impossible if we deploy on five different layer-2 blockchains. As a new startup, we need to focus and avoid a lot of noise from the outside world,” Kujo concludes.

90::https://theconversation.com/facebooks-libra-cryptocurrency-can-still-take-off-and-revolutionise-money-125504::The Conversation::article::Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency can still take off and revolutionise money::Libra has lost seven of its 28 founding members – but don’t expect that to hold it back.::Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency has suffered a few setbacks recently. As well as facing pressure from global regulators, seven of its 28 founding members have left the project – including high profile firms PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, eBay and Stripe. It leaves 21 companies in the Libra Association, the organisation overseeing the cryptocurrency. But Facebook is big enough to launch Libra on its own, so why are these members even needed? After all, it is Facebook’s network of 1.59 billion daily active users that form the foundation of its business case to issue a non-sovereign currency. Why share the spoils? The answer may be twofold. First, by having a council of members this enables Facebook to claim decentralisation status – a key tenet of any cryptocurrency. It’s a far cry from the fully decentralised alternatives of bitcoin et al., but certainly not centralised, so a valid claim. Second, and perhaps primarily, by having a group of high-profile businesses as Libra members it goes some way towards sugarcoating this disruption in the eyes of the world’s regulators, in readiness for the inevitable pushback. Many of the departing members – most being payments firms – stood to lose much of their core business if Libra becomes successful. So, in the face of the project facing additional scrutiny, Libra quickly became a net negative prospect for them and a respectful early withdrawal is entirely rational. But their places are likely to soon be taken up by other prospective members waiting in the wings. There are many companies that will want to capitalise on what could be a revolutionary global money system. Total membership is likely to be expanded as a show of strength. Ben Maurer, Facebook’s blockchain technology lead, explained in June that, “over time, [Libra] is designed to transition the node membership from these founding members, who have a stake in the creation of the ecosystem, to people who hold Libra and have a stake in the ecosystem as a whole”. Read more: Facebook’s Libra: it’s not the ‘crypto’ that’s the issue, it's the organisation behind it Facebook has already announced that some 1,500 entities have expressed interest. So turning up the dial of decentralisation is the intended objective – publicly, at least. This will help assuage the concerns of regulators that Facebook holds too much power over the new cryptocurrency. The fight for the future of money is on. What is at stake is the ability to extract value from the minting of new currency, known as seigniorage. The stakes couldn’t be higher. The Bank of International Settlements (the bank for central banks) estimates that total global money is approximately US$5 trillion, while the CIA put that figure closer to US$80 trillion in 2017, if “broad money” (which includes the figures in everyone’s bank accounts) is included. In comparison, the market capitalisation of all cryptocurrencies at the time of writing is US$215 billion, some 372 times smaller than this latter estimate of total money. Facebook has the reach and the technology to make its cryptocurrency mainstream, but nation states have the regulatory power of veto to retain their monopolistic hold over monetary policy. Presently, their strategy is to spook any potential Libra partners to abandon the project. For example, US senators Sherrod Brown and Brian Schatz sent a letter earlier this month to the CEOs of Visa, Mastercard and Stripe saying any Libra members should expect a higher level of scrutiny not just of this project but also of their core business, too. Read more: Facebook's libra has staggering potential – state control of money could end But this pressure will only work with some companies – particularly more traditional financial firms that will ultimately lose out to Libra. The goals of the Libra project are big. If Facebook wanted to simply make some extra profits, it could have issued a voucher system, akin to a supermarket reward scheme. See Facebook’s previous attempt at issuing Facebook Credits that were terminated in 2012. This would probably have avoided the regulatory scrutiny it has received with the Libra project and would be well-placed to take off. If Facebook simply charged users for tokens used to play games or purchase content within its applications, then regulators may have been less interested. After all, what is the real difference between purchasing Facebook credit with domestic currency to, say, purchasing credit from Vodafone to top up a prepay phone? But the Libra project is more than this. Its aim is not to create a voucher system for internal use – it is not even to create a rival to a national currency – it is to create a global currency more similar to the euro than the US dollar, to service the under-banked and unbanked as well as threaten the dominance of existing fiat currencies in established markets. The Libra Association provides this possibility because it gives the project clout and legitimacy in front of regulators. It may even be that the financial regulators will in time feel a missed opportunity in not supporting the Libra project further. Cryptocurrencies, and corporate cryptocurrencies especially, continue to evolve and innovate. A challenger currency like Libra, with a transparent operating structure, the involvement of traditional financial firms and a recognisable, if currently bespoke monetary mechanism, could soon be seen as the lesser of forthcoming monetary evils in the form of truly decentralised globally relevant cryptocurrencies. If that is the case, expect a renewed clamour for a seat at the Libra Association table.::2019-10-18T12:12:15Z::Bitcoin, Blockchain, Central banks, Cryptocurrency, Facebook, Finance, Financial regulations, Libra, Mark Zuckerberg, Money::Gavin Brown::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/297641/original/file-20191018-56228-848dsw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C142%2C5611%2C2805&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

Trading volume in futures and options tied to cryptocurrencies on centralized exchanges rose 86.5% to a record high of $6.18 trillion, translating to three times of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. Still, the market dominance of derivatives slipped to 67.8%, the lowest since December 2022 as traders flocked to the spot market, where cryptocurrencies are exchanged for immediate delivery. Spot trading volume jumped 108% to $2.94 trillion, the highest monthly volume since May 2021. The combined spot and derivatives trading volume increased 92.9% to a record $9.12 trillion. "The spike in spot trading activity on centralized exchanges coincides with the growing excitement around Bitcoin reaching new all-time highs and the initial signs of returning retail participants in the market," CCData's monthly report said. Derivatives are often criticized for creating artifical demand and supply via leverage, injecting volatility into the market and are considered a proxy for speculative activity often observed at major market tops. As such, the decline in derivatives' share of the total market activity might be a good news for crypto bulls anticipating a continued price rally. Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market value, rose 16.6% in March, setting new record highs above $73,000, CoinDesk data show. Prices rose over 68% in the first quarter. The CoinDesk 20 Index, a broader market gauge, jumped over 50% in the first three months. Edited by Parikshit Mishra.

The platform is designed with ease and security in mind, enabling users to begin staking with as little as $1 and allowing for the flexibility to opt out at any time.

Non-custodial wallet for Solana staking – Image via Atomic Wallet Atomic Wallet provides extensive support to SOL staking, ensuring users have 100% control over their funds. Trusted by over five million users worldwide, it’s accessible on various operating systems, including Windows, MacOS, Ubuntu, Debian, and Fedora. With Atomic Wallet, users can earn up to 7% APY on staking SOL, with a maximum stake of 100,000 coins for periods ranging from 24 hours to 12 months. The interface makes it easy to track and manage the staked funds and start earning rewards promptly. The wallet further streamlines the staking process by automating all background operations, including the creation of the stake account. However, each time a user initiates a staking or unstaking transaction for SOL, a network fee is required. Additionally, to ensure future transactional activities are seamless, Atomic Wallet reserves 0.000038 SOL from the user address. The SOL deposits remain locked during the staking period. They are not counted towards the total balance and can’t be transferred or swapped. Staking and unstaking take about three days each per epoch, and users start earning rewards approximately two epochs after the deposit is fully staked. Lastly, each additional SOL staking creates a new stake account on the blockchain, not combining with existing ones. Liquid staking with Jito – Image via Jito Jito is a liquid staking solution for Solana, offering users the ability to earn rewards through Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) powered staking. It enables users to unlock liquidity on their staked SOL and support network decentralization by spreading stakes across the network. The process involves depositing SOL into the Jito pool to receive JitoSOL, which then gets delegated to MEV-enabled validators. These validators earn MEV rewards by auctioning off block space, and the rewards are redistributed to the stake pool as extra APY in addition to the regular staking rewards The platform leverages state-of-the-art encryption techniques and multi-layered security protocols to safeguard users’ assets, ensuring peace of mind throughout the staking journey.

Here are some common ones: Each method has its own risk, reward, and commitment level, so it’s crucial to do your research and consider what fits best with your investment strategy, technical ability, and risk tolerance. Choose a wallet that supports Solana and staking, like Phantom, Solflare, or Ledger. Download the wallet application and securely set it up. Remember to store your seed phrase safely. If you don’t already own SOL, you can purchase it from a cryptocurrency exchange such as Binance, Coinbase, or Kraken. After purchasing, transfer the SOL to your chosen wallet. Start by accessing the staking section within your chosen wallet. Then, create a new staking account, following the wallet’s prompts. Finally, transfer the desired amount of SOL from your wallet to the newly created staking account Validators are nodes that process transactions and run the blockchain. Look for a validator with a good track record, reasonable fees, and is geographically distributed to ensure network resilience. To delegate your SOL: Your stake will need to go through an activation period. Once it is active, you’ll start earning rewards. These rewards are typically distributed every epoch and can be auto-staked or transferred to your wallet, depending on your settings. Regularly check your staking status and the performance of your validator. You can unstake, restake, or add more SOL to your staking to adjust your investments. If you decide to unstake your SOL: Gain perspective on cryptocurrency investments by reading about the outcomes of investing $1000 in the top 5 cryptocurrencies at the start of 2023.

By selecting the optimal platform, you not only secure attractive yields but also actively safeguard the network’s stability. In essence, you become a stakeholder in the future of DeFi itself. So, cast off your hesitation, choose your platform, and stake your claim in the Solana sun.

This method lets traders speculate on price movements, bet on prices going up or down, and potentially profit from these predictions. These contracts are typically leveraged, meaning traders can control large amounts of cryptocurrency with a relatively small amount of capital, which can increase both potential gains and risks. In contract trading, “long” and “short” are terms used to describe the types of bets traders make on the future price movements of cryptocurrencies. Both types of trading often use leverage, which means using borrowed money to increase potential returns. This can make both potential profits and losses significantly larger than in traditional trading. Choosing the right crypto contract trading platform involves considering various factors to ensure that the platform meets your trading needs and provides a secure, reliable environment. Here’s how to evaluate different platforms: Contract trading in cryptocurrency offers several benefits that make it an attractive option for many traders: Overall, the main benefit of contract trading in cryptocurrency is that it can provide sophisticated mechanisms for traders looking to exploit market inefficiencies, hedge, or increase exposure to markets with a relatively small capital outlay. Contract trading in cryptocurrency, while offering potential benefits, also carries several risks: Crypto contract trading and traditional options trading share some fundamental similarities. However, they also have distinct differences catering to different traders and investment strategies. Crypto contract trading platforms offer several advantages that can be appealing to both novice and experienced traders: While these advantages make crypto contract trading attractive, traders need to consider the associated risks and ensure they understand the market before participating. An anecdote of crypto contract trading going wrong: This is where the risks of contract trading and leveraged trading come in, and when you can't afford your risk, you shouldn't be doing it Investing in crypto contracts involves several straightforward steps. Here’s a simple guide to get you started: Before investing, learn about different types of crypto contracts, such as futures, options, and perpetual swaps. Understand the terms, mechanics, and risks associated with each. Selecting the right crypto futures trading platforms is essential for accessing various instruments and leverage options. Consider security features, regulatory compliance, trading fees, and customer support. Register for an account on your chosen platform. You will likely need to verify your identity with documents such as a passport or driver’s license, depending on the platform’s requirements and your region’s regulations. Once your account is set up, deposit funds. Most platforms accept cryptocurrency deposits, and some also support fiat currencies like USD or EUR. Choose your preferred method and follow the instructions to make a deposit. Develop a trading plan. Decide how much you want to invest, set your profit targets and loss limits, and how you will manage risks, especially since crypto contracts can involve leverage. Select the type of contracts you want to trade. Each contract has specific characteristics and terms, such as expiration dates for futures and strike prices for options. Learning how to trade Bitcoin options can significantly enhance your ability to manage risk and capitalize on market volatility. Use a trading interface to place your trades. You can choose from various order types, such as market orders (buy/sell immediately at current prices) or limit orders (set a specific price at which you want to buy or sell). Once you have opened positions, monitor the market closely. Use tools like stop-loss orders to manage risk. Moreover, be prepared to adjust your positions based on market movements and news. Decide when to exit your trades. Depending on the contract type, you can close your positions by executing a trade in the opposite direction or letting your options or futures expire. After closing your positions, you can choose to withdraw your profits or reinvest them into new contracts. Check the withdrawal procedures and limits on your platform. Following these steps will help you start investing in crypto contracts. Remember, it’s important to continually educate yourself and stay updated with market trends and news to make informed decisions. Looking to expand beyond the spot markets but not sure where to start? Here’s how to trade Bitcoin futures and options like a pro. Choosing the right crypto contract trading platform is essential. Whether your focus is on derivatives or leverage trading, the ideal platform should offer competitive trading fees, a user-friendly interface, and robust features. Remember that contract trading is high-risk, and you should never invest more than you can afford to lose. OKX, BingX, and Binance are considered some of the best platforms for options trading in cryptocurrency, offering extensive tools and a wide range of options. They provide deep liquidity, robust trading interfaces, and comprehensive security measures. Each platform caters to different levels of trader expertise and geographical availability. To evaluate the liquidity of a trading platform, check the trading volume of your desired assets, observe the tightness of the bid-ask spread, and note the speed at which trades are executed. High trading volumes and narrow spreads typically indicate good liquidity. Platforms often publish their liquidity metrics, which can provide further insights. Common fees in crypto contract trading include trading fees (maker and taker fees), withdrawal fees, and, in some cases, overnight financing fees (or funding rates) for holding positions open over a period. Trading fees vary by platform and can be reduced based on trading volume or platform-specific tokens. Some platforms may also charge deposit fees or fees for special order types. Yes, you can trade cryptocurrency contracts through various derivatives like futures, options, and perpetual swaps. These contracts allow traders to speculate on the future prices of cryptocurrencies without directly holding the asset. Most major crypto exchanges offer some form of contract trading. The best platform for crypto trading depends on the trader’s needs, but Binance and Kraken are widely regarded as leading choices. They offer many cryptocurrencies, advanced trading features, and robust security measures. Considerations for choosing a platform should include fees, available cryptocurrencies, and user interface. Yes, Binance is a contract trading platform that offers a variety of derivative products, including futures and options. It provides high liquidity, extensive leverage options, and a wide range of crypto pairs. Binance is known for its low fees and comprehensive platform features. The compatibility of contract trading with Islamic finance principles depends on the specific contract and trading method. Generally, conventional leveraged contract trading might not be considered halal due to the involvement of interest, excessive uncertainty, and speculation. However, Islamic finance products that comply with Shariah law are available on some platforms.

The study, published in a subsidiary of Nature, reported mixed results: The artists thought of blockchain as a possible new route for revenue generation but doubted blockchain-enabled applications would become reality. Interviewees believed that blockchain applications for the music industry could better their financial prospects and help protect copyright. Skepticism stemmed from a general belief that blockchain music startups would lack the heft to unseat the current behemoths in the music industry.

95::https://coinatory.com/cryptocurrency-news/bhutan-bitcoin-mining-18198/::Coinatory::article::Bhutan Embarks on Monumental Bitcoin Mining Expansion Before Next Halving::Discover Bhutan's ambitious plan to sextuple its Bitcoin mining operations by 2025, leveraging state-of-the-art technology and sustainable hydroelectric power, in a strategic move ahead of the Bitcoin halving.::In a strategic maneuver poised to redefine the cryptocurrency mining landscape, the Kingdom of Bhutan, in collaboration with the Nasdaq-listed mining titan Bitdeer, has announced plans to significantly bolster its Bitcoin mining operations. Amidst the looming anticipation of Bitcoin’s fourth halving event, this partnership aims to amplify Bhutan’s mining capacity to an astonishing 500 megawatts by 2025, marking a 600% increase. Druk Holding & Investments (DHI), Bhutan’s sovereign investment arm, is at the forefront of this ambitious initiative. By harnessing Bitdeer’s cutting-edge mining technology and Bhutan’s vast hydroelectric power resources, DHI is set to navigate the potential revenue fluctuations anticipated from the halving event. This expansion is not just a venture into enhancing computational power but a step towards solidifying Bhutan’s position as a frontrunner in the innovative ecosystem of cryptocurrency mining. Matt Linghui Kong, Bitdeer’s Chief Business Officer, revealed in a Bloomberg interview the project’s goal to elevate Bhutan’s mining capabilities to a total of 600 megawatts by the first half of 2025. This leap forward is underpinned by the deployment of the latest mining hardware, optimizing both cost efficiency and computing power. The financing of this substantial upgrade, though not publicly disclosed in its entirety, is understood to be supported by a $500 million fund jointly established by DHI and Bitdeer in May 2023. This financial infusion underscores the collaborative commitment to advancing Bhutan’s mining infrastructure, leveraging the country’s renewable energy assets. Situated between the economic powerhouses of China and India, Bhutan has long pursued economic diversification, with a particular emphasis on hydropower. The venture into cryptocurrency mining, spearheaded by Druk Holding & Investments, is viewed as a cornerstone for cultivating an innovation-driven economy. This includes ventures in asset tokenization and the creation of “Bhutanverse,” a pioneering metaverse project in partnership with Smobler Studios and The Sandbox, aimed at fostering a dynamic startup ecosystem. As the Bitcoin community anticipates the halving event slated for April, which will see mining rewards halve from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC per block, Bhutan and Bitdeer stand resilient. Their strategy is underpinned by Bitdeer’s competitive advantage of a low mining cost per Bitcoin, currently estimated at $20,000 per BTC, positioning them to navigate the challenges of reduced mining rewards with operational efficiency. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

96::https://cryptobriefing.com/evm-move-growth-surge/::Crypto Briefing::article::Move-based blockchains growth relies on EVM compatibility: Movement Labs co-founder::Movement Labs' M2 bridges Move and Ethereum ecosystems, set for testnet launch.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Move-based blockchains are surging in total value locked (TVL) this year, with Sui leaping 233% and Aptos also showing significant growth of 210%, according to data aggregator DefiLlama. Rushi Manche, co-founder of Movement Labs, believes that compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) could bolster this growth even more. “I think the biggest issue for new systems is how do you onboard developers and new users and a lot of these next-gen and new VM languages realize that if you don’t have compatibility for EVM, you really limit the amount of growth that you have the first two or three years,” said Manche to Crypto Briefing. Ethereum’s mainnet alone dominates over 67% of all decentralized finance TVL, and that’s the reason why new blockchains based on new virtual machines have to create compatibility. Movement’s M2 is the first layer-2 blockchain based on Move that has compatibility with EVM applications and can help bridge the gap between these two ecosystems. They are still in devnet phase, with testnet and mainnet phases set to launch later this year. Move is the language created by Meta to deploy their crypto project called Diem. However, due to regulatory pressure, Diem was shelved and two different groups consisting of former Meta employees created Aptos and Sui. “Broader than that, Movement itself has a network of blockchains where anyone who’s looking to launch their own customized high throughput rollup on Ethereum can leverage the Move Virtual Machine to launch their own framework with OP stack, Polygon CDK or Arbitrum Orbit.” To explain how Movement is combining EVM and Move, Manche uses the traditional technology sector, where new tech has backward compatibility with what has been used so far. As an example, he compared the Sony PlayStation consoles, as new models have compatibility with games launched for older generation versions. “So the way we approach it is: EVM compatibility is a way for us to onboard legacy software. If you want to write Uniswap, write Aave, or bring code from Arbitrum, the best way to do that is using the EVM interpreter.” Nevertheless, Manche still believes that long-term usage and long-term performance for smart contracts rely on Move and Rust programming languages.

97::https://theconversation.com/more-than-1-000-cryptocurrencies-have-already-failed-heres-what-will-affect-successes-in-future-127463::The Conversation::article::More than 1,000 cryptocurrencies have already failed – here’s what will affect successes in future::With Wall Street slowly taking charge of crypto, the days of radical outsiders launching successful altcoins may be numbered.::Many cryptocurrencies have been launched in the past few years, often to great fanfare and celebration, only to fade and fail as the public and investors shun them. According to Coinopsy, which tracks such failures, there are some 1,085 dead coins at the time of writing. That’s a substantial number, even next to the approximately 3,000 still in existence, and senior industry figures expect many of those to fail, too. Why do so many of these projects unravel? You expect many initiatives to come and go in a fledgling market, of course – the 1990s dotcom bubble is the perfect example. But at the same time, cryptocurrency developers have traditionally spent too little time designing the business-use case for their coins and tokens, then only realising after the launch that their idea is yesterday’s news. Time and again, we see launches that copy a previously successful coin – “coin x is the new Bitcoin”, for example. Yet the market already has Bitcoin, and it continues to be in demand – as evidenced by the 18 millionth Bitcoin being mined only last month. We tend to overlook this problem with developers, even while we rightly criticise regulators for not being able to keep up with the fast evolution of the crypto market – despite efforts such as Howey Coin by US regulator the SEC, which was a fake new coin offering designed to teach investors about the risks of putting money into crypto. No doubt these kinds of developer errors will continue. Here are several other themes that we think will have a bearing on future crypto failures: Eleven years ago, the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto quietly revolutionised money with the release of his or her now famous white paper that outlined Bitcoin. In the early years after this vision took off, many of those who launched altcoins and tokens were small teams of developers and leftfield entrepreneurs. They had a clear mission to bring the world of traditional finance and central banks to its knees with decentralised units of exchange that were beyond anyone’s control. A few years on, these bank killers have largely been assimilated by the big financial institutions they once sought to challenge. Wall Street is steadily taking charge of the crypto action, professionalising trading with the likes of derivatives and futures products. We may now be entering a phase where only large institutions will be able to generate profit from cryptocurrency design. It seems increasingly likely that the next revolutionary white paper will be generated by a global multi-billion-dollar firm – an ironic full turn of events, to say the least. Many other cryptocurrencies from more humble beginnings will fail in future, simply because they don’t have the resources to compete with these huge institutions. They will be driven by sunk costs and the crypto dream to dominate the future of money, but in many cases it won’t be enough. For a cryptocurrency to be successful, two things need to happen: there has to be a reason why people want to use it, and they have to trust it. People will generally trust a coin or token thanks to the underpinning blockchain technology, the decentralised cryptographic ledger systems on which this industry is built. This means that the basis upon which the market judges if a new launch will stand or fall is mainly its use case. There are now altcoins in existence offering everything from new ways to fund web advertising to units of exchange in the gaming world. But more generally, in a world in which it is no longer enough to simply claim to have launched a better Bitcoin, the market’s attention has pivoted towards stablecoins. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are designed to avoid the wild volatility of cousins like Bitcoin by being pegged or backed by assets like traditional currencies or precious metals. They are designed to encourage people to use cryptocurrency for everyday buying and selling, while also offering a stable store of value for traders on the many crypto exchanges that don’t deal in traditional currencies. Examples include USD Coin and Tether, both of which are equivalent to US$1. The fact that it takes considerable financial resources and infrastructure to make such coins operational is again likely to favour large institutions – witness Facebook’s attempt to launch the Libra stablecoin, for instance. Many investors have lost money through scams in the crypto world. One recent notorious example is the alleged OneCoin ponzi scam, in which investors were promised guaranteed 300% returns for investing Bitcoin or US dollars with a Nevada-based outfit. The money was supposed to be ploughed into foreign exchange options and altcoins, but was allegedly instead used to pay off other investors in the scheme. Fortune magazine recently speculated that OneCoin may have generated losses in excess of the US$19.4 billion (£15 billion) racked up by Bernie Maddoff’s ponzi victims in 2008. Somewhat different was Bitconnect, an exchange in which investors could swap Bitcoin for Bitconnect coins, which would be lent out with claimed returns of up to 120% per year. After longstanding ponzi accusations, the US authorities stepped in last year and the exchange abruptly closed. Bitconnect coins plunged 96% in value, creating huge losses, though they still exist and trade today. An alternative problem is hackers raiding exchanges. The most infamous example is the Mt Gox attack of 2014, in which over 850,000 bitcoins were stolen and never recovered. More recently the Binance exchange, one of the world’s largest, has been hacked several times, costing investors tens of millions of dollars. One other alarming case was that of Gerald Cotten, the 30-year-old founder of Canadian cryptocurrency exchange Quadriga, who died a year ago. Because nobody had access to his passwords, the investments of 115,000 customers worth US$137m were unrecoverable. When a court-appointed auditor was eventually able to access his account, it turned out the assets had all been sold months before Cotten died. We fully expect these sorts of problems to continue – and this shouldn’t be surprising. We are talking about a toxic combination of anonymous technology that is largely unregulated, poorly understood, and cheap and easy to move around the world – and many people willing to kiss frogs in their search for a lucrative prince.::2019-11-21T13:47:23Z::Bitcoin, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, Facebook, Libra, Satoshi Nakamoto, Tether, stablecoin::Gavin Brown::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/302732/original/file-20191120-524-1njq9ry.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=115%2C469%2C5139%2C2569&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
98::https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/04/hedge-funds-hold-record-bearish-bitcoin-bets-data-show/::CoinDesk::article::Hedge Funds Hold Record Bearish Bitcoin Bets, Data Show::Most funds may have taken short positions as a part of a "carry trade," one observer said.::Leveraged funds, which the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) describes as hedge funds and commodity trading advisers, held record bearish wagers on the bitcoin (BTC) price at the end of the first quarter as the cryptocurrency's rally stalled near record highs. Hedge funds boosted their net short positions in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's (CME) standard bitcoin futures contracts to 16,102. That's the most since the futures began trading in late 2017, according to CFTC figures published last week. CME's standard bitcoin futures contracts are sized at 5 BTC. A short futures position is a trading strategy in which a trader sells a futures contract to profit from or hedge against an expected drop in the underlying asset's price. Carry traders or arbitrageurs short futures while simultaneously buying the asset to safely pocket the price differential between the spot and futures market. The record buildup in short positions likely reflects hedge funds' renewed interest in the carry trade, according to Markus Thielen, CEO of 10x Research. "There is a massive demand from hedge funds to put on carry trades. Despite bitcoin’s -10% decline from the all-time high, the futures premium has remained in double digits, and hedge funds are taking advantage of these high rates," Thielen told CoinDesk in an interview. While bitcoin's bullish momentum stalled after hitting record highs above $73,500 in March, CME futures continue to trade at an annualized three-month premium of over 10%, according to Velo Data. In other words, carry trades still yield at least twice as much as the 10-year Treasury note, which offered a so-called risk-free return of 4.36% at press time. That said, some hedge funds may have taken outright bearish bets as recent robust U.S. economic data and hawkish comments from the Fed officials weakened the case for rapid-fire interest-rate cuts in the near term. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell emphasized the need to see how inflation evolves in the coming months, keeping the timing of the first-rate cut uncertain. Since the release of upbeat manufacturing data on Monday, the probability of the Fed cutting rates in June has dropped below 50%. In addition, some observers are skeptical that the impending mining reward halving will live up to its bullish reputation. The Bitcoin blockchain's fourth mining reward halving, due later this month, reduces the per-block amount of BTC issued as a reward to miners to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC. Historically, bitcoin has chalked out major bull runs 12 to 18 months after halving, when the reduced per-block emission met demand. If past data is a guide, the path of least resistance is higher. However, according to David Duong, head of institutional research at Coinbase, the small sample size makes it difficult to draw definite conclusions in a market fundamentally altered by the January debut of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. "We believe that bitcoin’s market dynamics have fundamentally changed with the advent of U.S. spot BTC ETFs," Duong said in a market update last month. "Their multi-billion dollar net inflows in just two months have irrevocably altered the landscape. With major institutional players now capable of taking exposure through these vehicles, bitcoin's response to the upcoming halving may not necessarily mirror its performance in prior cycles." "We think studies of previous cycles should be interpreted cautiously, as the small sample size makes it difficult to generalize patterns here," he said. The launch of spot ETFs brought lifted bitcoin to record highs ahead of the halving, as opposed to previous cycles. That has left the door open for a post-halving price drop. Analysts at JPMorgan foresee bitcoin falling to $42,000 after the halving hype subsides. At press time, bitcoin changed hands near $66,000. Edited by Sheldon Reback.

With multi-chains support, including Ethereum and Arbitrum, OKX Wallet simplifies the management of ARB tokens across different networks, offering a seamless experience for users engaged in the decentralized ecosystems. Arbitrum is a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum developed by Offchain Labs. The New York-based company was founded by Ed Felten, a computer science professor at Princeton, Steven Goldfeder, a PhD graduate, and Harry Kalodner, a current PhD student at Princeton University. Designed to address some of the inherent limitations of Ethereum-based smart contracts, such as low efficiency and high execution costs, Arbitrum significantly reduces transaction costs and enhances user experience by avoiding the high gas fees typically associated with the Ethereum network. It processes transactions off the main Ethereum chain using Optimistic Rollup technology, which increases throughput and ensures transactions are executed more swiftly while maintaining the full security of the Ethereum mainnet. ARB is the governance token of the Arbitrum layer-2 blockchain, developed by Offchain Labs in 2021 to enhance Ethereum’s scalability. Although ARB tokens are not used to pay transaction fees on the Arbitrum chain, they hold significant use cases, primarily in governance and network decision-making. As of May 10, 2024, ARB has a market capitalization of $2,758,848,660, per CoinMarketCap data. It is priced at $1.04, sitting 56.43% below its all-time high of $2.40 (reached in January 2024). When selecting an Arbitrum (ARB) wallet, look for robust security features such as 2FA, end-to-end encryption, and hardware support. Here are other factors to be on the lookout for: The process of setting up a crypto wallet is simple and tends to be similar regardless of the wallet you choose. For this example, we’ll use the CoinEx Wallet. Here’s a quick walkthrough to get you started: 2. Creating a strong password is crucial when setting up your wallet. This should be a unique combination of letters, numbers, and special characters you have not used elsewhere. 3. During the wallet setup process, you will be prompted to write down mnemonic words from one to 12. Recording these words in a safe place offline. Note that your account may be irretrievable afterward if you lose this phrase. 4. Voila! After setting up your wallet, you can add ARB by going to the network selection area. The best Arbitrum wallet is the one that most suits your individual needs and requirements. Consider your investment goals. Are you looking to hold ARB long-term? If so, a hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor makes the most sense. Those looking to trade ARB and have instant access to holdings may prefer a hot wallet like the Coinbase Wallet, OKX Wallet, or CoinEx Wallet. Regardless of the storage solution you choose, ensure to prioritize crypto wallet security at all times. Wallets like Ledger, Trezor, Coinbase Wallet, CoinEx Wallet, and OKX Wallet can hold assets on the Arbitrum network. These wallets support Ethereum and, by extension, can manage native tokens of its layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum.

They used “prebiotic feedstocks” like water and nitrogen to trace how early compounds eventually led to human existence. The researchers, operating out of the Institute of Organic Chemistry in Poland, first published an article in Science in 2020 in which they created a version of this network — albeit one with limitations. The Golem network, operating as a layer-2 distributed computing platform, enabled the researchers to construct a network that was 100,000 times larger than their initial attempt. Read more: We need to decentralize science In a paper published in the academic journal Chem, the researchers detail how this “counterintuitive marriage” between crypto and origins of life research allowed them to pull off a far bigger version of the network without needing access to supercomputing resources. Golem’s network operates on a peer-to-peer basis, where individuals can rent out their idle computing power in exchange for GLM tokens, the native cryptocurrency of the Golem network. The researchers simulated 11 billion reactions comprising 20,000 CPU cores on Golem. They paid out 82,000 GLM to the computing power providers which translated to roughly $38,000 at the time. At GLM’s current price, the tokens would be worth roughly $17,000. In the article, the research team estimates that running the simulation with Web2 cloud providers would have cost $80,000. Crowdfunding-like approaches to academic research are one of crypto’s burgeoning use cases. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has been selling off 2% of his COIN equity to fund ResearchHub. The “GitHub for scientists” funds research by doing things like paying for peer reviews. Its native ResearchCoin appreciated by 1000% in late 2023.

This reduction in mining difficulty took place amidst a decline in Bitcoin’s price, which fell to $40,500 on the night of December 11. This marks the first decrease in Bitcoin’s mining difficulty since mid-September 2023, as reported by BTC.com. Changes in this metric are significant as they influence the timing of the upcoming halving, anticipated in April 2024. The previous adjustment to this metric was on November 26, 2023, when there was a 5.07% increase from its former level, with the hashrate at that time being 480.85 EH/s. The forthcoming adjustment in mining difficulty is provisionally set for December 23, 2023. BTC.com predicts a minor reduction of 0.12%. It’s noteworthy that since mid-September, the average hashrate on the Bitcoin network has been predominantly on the rise. According to an expert from PlanB, this trend is attributed to ETF issuers. The analyst also notes that large corporations purchasing Bitcoin directly from miners tend to affect its price, often leading to a simultaneous increase in the hashrate. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

102::https://cryptobriefing.com/solana-fastest-blockchain-coingecko/::Crypto Briefing::article::Solana leads as the fastest among large-scale blockchains — CoinGecko::Solana's TPS is 46 times faster than Ethereum and 5 times faster than Polygon.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Research from CoinGecko says that Solana is the fastest among large-scale blockchains, with its actual daily average transactions per second (TPS) reaching a record high of 1,504 on April 6, 2023 as the meme coin mania took off. Such a statistic makes Solana roughly 46 times faster than Ethereum, and 5 times faster than Polygon. To determine the fastest blockchains, CoinGecko’s study analyzed the processing speed of the top 30 blockchains based on their total value locked (TVL) ranking on DefiLlama as of May 15, 2024. Processing speed was measured using the actual or realized transactions per second (TPS) metric, calculated as a daily average to ensure a standardized comparison across as many blockchains as possible. CoinGecko claims the highest real TPS values reported in the study may differ from other calculations because these use daily averages. The TPS data was sourced from publicly available information provided by the respective blockchain explorers and Dune Analytics. However, some blockchains, including Hyperliquid, PulseChain, Kava, Cardano, and Rootstock, were excluded from the study due to a lack of sufficient data. Despite ranking as the fastest blockchain, Solana has still only achieved 1.6% of its theoretical maximum speed of 65,000 TPS, CoinGecko claims. The surging number of transactions resulted in network congestion, and it remains to be seen how quickly Solana can record higher real TPS after its upcoming upgrades. The second-fastest blockchain is another non-EVM, Sui, which recorded its highest real TPS of 854 in July 2023 as onchain game Sui 8192 gained popularity. Other fast blockchains among the non-EVMs include TON at 175 TPS and Near Protocol at 118 TPS. Altogether, the 8 non-EVM large blockchains have an average peak TPS of 284, making them 3.9 times faster than the 17 largest EVM and EVM-compatible blockchains, which realized an average of just 74 TPS. Among the EVM blockchains, BNB Smart Chain (BSC) achieved 378 in real TPS on December 7, 2023, amid the inscriptions-driven surge in onchain activity. This makes BSC the fastest blockchain among EVMs, despite only ranking third overall and reaching less than half of Sui’s realized processing speed. Similarly, the inscriptions craze allowed Polygon to record 190 in real TPS on November 16, 2023, making it the fastest among the largest Ethereum scaling solutions and 8.4 times faster than Ethereum itself. Ethereum and its ten largest scaling solutions registered a total real TPS of 500, placing their combined processing speed ahead of BSC but still slower than Solana and Sui. Almost all of the 25 blockchains experienced their highest real TPS over the last one year, pointing to onchain activity increasing and reaching higher levels in recent months, led by inscriptions and meme coin speculation.

103::https://theconversation.com/how-bitcoin-futures-trading-could-burst-the-cryptocurrencys-bubble-88971::The Conversation::article::How Bitcoin futures trading could burst the cryptocurrency’s bubble::Futures trading is driving up the price of Bitcoin but institutional investors remain cautious.::A new wave was added to the never-ending Bitcoin mania when the Chicago Board of Exchange (CBOE) became the first major derivative exchange to launch Bitcoin futures on December 10. Such was the euphoria among early investors that trading was halted twice due to CBOE speed breakers, which slow or pause trading when price movements are excessive. The launch of Bitcoin futures at CBOE is set to be followed by its cross-town rival, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, which plans to launch its own version of Bitcoin futures trading on December 18. And Nasdaq is preparing for a similar launch in the second-half of 2018. Bitcoin futures allows traders to speculate on what the Bitcoin price will be at a later date. For instance, at the time of writing this article, the January contract for Bitcoin was trading around US$18,300, up from an opening price of US$15,000. Traders bet on this and profit accordingly. Such was the excitement at the launch of futures that the Bitcoin price touched an all-time high of US$17,382.64 after one day of CBOE trading. This might sound good for Bitcoin lovers, but it could yet spell doom for the cryptocurrency in the long run. Bitcoin futures could actually end up reducing the price of Bitcoin. Futures trading gives new investors the choice to bet against Bitcoin and also allows them to settle contracts in dollars, boosting their liquidity. Plus, Bitcoin futures allows investors to trade off the cryptocurrency without actually owning it. This protects them from any volatility in the real-time spot market. This could reduce the demand for Bitcoin, pushing down prices. Even though crypto futures are new to the market, futures contract trading dates back to ancient times. In 1750BC in Mesopotamia the Babylonian king, Hammurabi, introduced a legal code, which included stipulations for trading goods at a future date for an agreed-upon price. A futures contract, in its simplest form, is an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a future date at an agreed-upon price. One party to the contract agrees to buy a given quantity of securities (such as stocks or bonds) or commodities (oil, gold, Bitcoin), and take the delivery on a future date while the other party agrees to deliver the asset. Futures markets involve hedgers and speculators. Hedgers are concerned with protecting themselves from future price drops. Hedgers will buy or sell their commodity to lock in a price against future risks of it dropping in value. Speculators assume the risk, often borrowing a substantial amount of money to buy contracts that they hope will go up in the future. If the market moves against them, they will lose more than they invested. One key requirement of futures contracts is that they must be traded on standardised exchanges such as the CBOE or CME. The arrival of Bitcoin futures at an established and well-regulated derivative exchange will encourage more investors to trade in digital currency, giving Bitcoin a place among mainstream finance. Even household names including Goldman Sachs have said they plan to clear Bitcoin futures on behalf of some clients. This will fuel the cryptocurrency’s price rise, as crypto traders and dealers can hedge their positions based on the future market. For example Bitcoin miners will benefit from futures contracts as they can use them to hedge against their mining cost, getting money in advance from speculators hoping to make a future profit. On the flip side, the launch of Bitcoin futures will attract greater scrutiny from the regulators which will cast a shadow on the fate of the Bitcoin in the long run. In this regard, the trade association for the futures markets, the Futures Industry Association warned the US regulator that not enough risk evaluation has been done on Bitcoin and the risks it poses to financial stability. The launch of Bitcoin futures has aggravated other regulators, with scrutiny beginning to encircle the cryptocurrency. Hong Kong’s regulator issued a warning that only licensed firms can offer such products within Hong Kong. In Korea, the Financial Services Commission financial regulator issued a directive that bans securities firms from taking part in Bitcoin futures transactions. Perhaps more worryingly, the levels of futures trading has not been as high as the initial flurry of excitement may suggest. The volume of trading since bitcoin’s launch on CBOE has been relatively low, especially compared with more established currencies futures. So, although Bitcoin has the added legitimacy of being traded on futures exchanges, the relatively low levels of interest from big institutional investors is indicative. If history is anything to go by, the tulip bubble burst in February 1637 – not long after the Dutch created a futures market for buying bulbs in 1636 at the peak of tulip mania. The advent of futures trading may well further inflate the “Bitcoin bubble” and push it to its bursting point.::2017-12-13T16:14:41Z::Bitcoin, Commodities, Cryptocurrency, Currencies, Investment, Trading::Nafis Alam::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/199000/original/file-20171213-27555-auyx8h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C568%2C5501%2C2751&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

Yet, Binance is not just a trading platform offering indicators, trading tools, and tradable assets. It is also a one-stop on-ramping/ offramping platform, helping users convert their hard-earned money to crypto and vice versa. With Binance P2P, users can directly buy and sell crypto in an open market. This Binance P2P guide takes you through how the process works and how to navigate the P2P space safely. P2P stands for peer-to-peer. P2P crypto transactions signify the transfer of assets between two people without a middleman. Even though Binance is typically a middleman when you execute spot and limit trades, charging marker and taker fees along the way, it has a separate P2P section to fulfill the individual-specific crypto supply and demand. Low transaction fees, privacy protection, and secure transactions are just some of the advantages of trading on #Binance P2P. pic.twitter.com/uvo41ATKD3 Think of P2P as selling your crypto directly to a person and receiving cash (bank transfers) in return. Here’s how the process is initiated on any peer-to-peer crypto exchange: This is what a simplified version of a peer-to-peer transaction looks like. Even though the concept of P2P holds for any peer-to-peer crypto exchange, Binance offers additional anonymity and a wide selection of tradable assets. You can buy BTC and other crypto assets using direct payment methods or sell USDT, BNB, or a host of other cryptos and get paid directly into your e-wallet or bank account. Binance P2P buying and selling makes life easier for users who receive their salary or fee in crypto, want to initiate quick trades, offload assets quickly, and make quick crypto purchases to ride market sentiments, among other things. Of course, Binance isn’t the only P2P crypto exchange in town. Several Binance alternatives include the likes of OKX, Paxful, and Hodl Hodl. This Binance P2P guide/explainer will highlight how a few simple components comprise the entire P2P architecture. Here are the underlying elements. To use Binance’s P2P functionality, you first need to create a basic user account. Note that peer-to-peer account setup requires stringent KYC verification, regardless of whether you are a buyer or a seller. You can enhance your Binance P2P buying, selling, or rather trading profile by relying on ads. These advertisements position your P2P need at the top of the list, allowing buyers and sellers to locate you quickly. Notably, placing ads comes with a few conditions: Did you know? When setting up your advertisement, you can choose between a “Buy” or “Sell” ad type, select the crypto asset and fiat currency, and choose between fixed or floating pricing. Additionally, you can specify the total trading amount, order limits, and up to three payment methods. You also have the flexibility to add terms and an auto-reply message when users respond to your ad. As for the changes, new trade advertisements can be subjected to transaction fees, anywhere between 0 and 0.35%, depending on the pair’s liquidity. In Binance P2P, the pair signifies the crypto you wish to trade and the currency you wish to offload or purchase it in. The entire buyer-seller interaction on Binance is managed by an escrow. Here is how it works: Once a buyer accepts an offer, the seller’s cryptocurrency is automatically locked in Binance’s escrow service. This escrow holds the crypto securely until the transaction is completed, ensuring that the seller does not lose their crypto if the buyer fails to pay. Binance P2P payment methods range from standard bank transfers to UPI (India-specific) to e-wallets and others. “Bharat Web3 Association shared a video with RBI on Binance P2P trades and then requested the central bank to permit the resumption of UPI/payment services for the VDA (crypto) sector. Soon you can expect a crack down on Binance P2P use in India or resumption of UPI services.” As someone looking to buy or sell USDT or any other cryptocurrency, you can tweak and choose the Binance P2P payment methods depending on your region of operation. The seller leads the fund-release mechanism and must confirm the payment. Once done, the Binance P2P escrow releases the digital assets to the buyer’s wallet. This issue will be there, without P2P. With P2P, this risk shifts to the seller. Because then, funds will be received in Bank account of seller of crypto. That is why we see many Binance users complaining that bank account is frozen. Here is how the process works: When you initiate a transaction on Binance P2P, the crypto that’s being sold is temporarily transferred to Binance’s escrow service. This secure holding continues until the buyer has paid and confirmed it within the platform. Once the seller confirms receiving the payment, Binance releases the cryptocurrency from escrow to the buyer. If any disputes arise, either party can initiate an appeal, which leads to an investigation by Binance’s customer support to resolve the issue and decide the rightful owner of the funds. The escrow mechanism functions by automatically reserving the cryptocurrency when an advertisement for selling crypto is posted. This amount is deducted from the seller’s funding wallet and held securely by Binance. If a buyer marks a transaction as paid but fails to transfer the funds, or if there’s any other dispute, the seller can appeal, and Binance will hold the crypto in escrow until the issue is resolved based on the provided evidence. This escrow system ensures that transactions are safe and minimizes the risk of scams and theft, which is crucial given the irreversible nature of cryptocurrency transactions. The service also incorporates identity verification measures to ensure that all users trade under their true identities, enhancing the platform’s overall security. In cases where there is a dispute — such as a buyer claiming that the payment was made but the seller not releasing the cryptocurrency — the involved parties can file an appeal. It’s shocking – So many people are reporting that they used P2P which resulted in Bank account freeze. These are only 50% of the messages that I received on x. Have even more on email. Will be making a detailed video on this topic soon covering : Steps to follow, how to get… pic.twitter.com/fN5eGOGJyv Other concerns like bank account freeze, chargeback placements, and more can also be raised using Binance’s dispute resolution mechanism. Binance’s customer service then steps in to resolve the dispute based on evidence provided by both sides, such as payment receipts or chat logs. If you want to buy or sell USDT or any other crypto, you should check the feedback and rating before proceeding. You can find the details by clicking on the buyer profile. The P2P page also has other tabs — Express, Block, Cash, and P2P. Each refers to a different kind of peer-to-peer cryptocurrency order type. The P2P Express Zone simplifies the trading process by allowing you to place orders quickly by entering the fiat amount you want to buy or sell. The system then matches you with the best available order from a verified merchant. This method best suits crypto novices and those starting out their P2P journey. The Block Trade Zone is for users interested in making large-volume trades. This zone ensures that such trades are handled securely, typically involving verified merchants known as block traders. At some specific locations, certain buyers might provide cash-based selling facilities. However, you must deal in a safe environment to avoid getting scammed. #Binance P2P Supports Cash-in-Person Transactions as a Payment Method ➡️ https://t.co/EKhvgIcAAw pic.twitter.com/Uqjb7oVZ1h It is important to check how all these elements pertaining to the Binance P2P architecture work in unison. Here are the steps to consider: If you want to buy crypto using the Binance P2P interface, you can click on the “Buy” tab, and at first, you will see the advertisements. If you like an offer posted by the seller — preferred rates and payment methods — you need to hit the “Buy” button against the seller’s name. Do note that as the buyer, you can raise a cancellation request first. You can then verify the seller credentials, maximum amount, past orders, and more on their profile page. If you want to sell, you need to connect with a buyer. If you plan to sell USDT or any other supported crypto, you are the one in charge of the assets. Only when you confirm receipt of the funds will the buyer receive the relevant digital assets. Before that happens, the cryptocurrency is held securely by the Binance Escrow. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) support a form of peer-to-peer (P2P) trading. However, they operate differently from traditional P2P platforms like those provided by centralized exchanges (CEXs). In DEXs, the P2P aspect is inherent in the technology — traders interact directly with each other via blockchain-based smart contracts rather than through a managed platform that facilitates trades with traditional order books. Do note that DEX-based P2Ps are more like token swaps as to off-ramp, you will always need a CEX. However, cash-based P2P transactions — also known as F2F or face-to-face transactions — can be initiated using DEXs. The Binance P2P interface comes with a host of features. Some of the most obvious ones include: You can consider these features as the Binance P2P trading benefits. P2P transactions seem easy. Yet, they have their own share of pitfalls. Here’s what to be aware of: Genuine P2P concerns: 3/ Identified accounts at Noones and Paxful (P2P marketplaces) that received funds from the hacks and were used to convert crypto to fiat. pic.twitter.com/0O3V726dAq Tax obligations for P2P transactions can be unclear and vary by jurisdiction, complicating compliance for users who may not understand their tax liabilities from crypto trading. For instance, if you are from India and filing taxes, you must report the nature of your crypto dealings, including P2P. CA Sonu Jain, a crypto tax specialist, spoke with BeInCrypto about tax-specific approaches toward P2P trading and how an average trader could navigate these scam-filled waters. “Investors who are engaged in P2P trading should be cautious when dealing with unknown individuals online. Investors in India, for example, can take some of the below steps to mitigate the risk of fraud: These steps although may sound lengthy and difficult, but they will help you stay away from scammers & deal with genuine Investors.” In some cases, Binance hasn’t fully cooperated with the authorities to quell concerns related to anti-money laundering and scams. Several subsidiaries like the Binance U.S. may have P2P restrictions on them due to (a lack of) regulatory oversight. As a buyer or seller, you should take note of this before proceeding. Nigeria's Central Bank has now prohibited banks from processing #bitcoin and cryptocurrency transactions. The country ranks second in P2P #bitcoin volume. pic.twitter.com/2bSXoPv6h6 In the world of P2P, security must be a top priority. Here are a few safety tips to follow: This Binance P2P guide shows the ease with which users can conduct peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions. However, in light of the growing prevalence of scams and the need for greater regulatory innovation, we expect this peer-to-peer crypto exchange to move to offer additional security standards, like anomaly detection and enhanced encryption. Furthermore, in the future, Binance is likely to increasingly rely on AI for more optimized order-matching experiences, especially for crypto newcomers. Binance P2P can be profitable, especially for those who act as merchants on the platform. Merchants earn by posting trading ads and completing trades, benefiting from low-fee structures, and sometimes participating in special promotions. The platform’s zero trading fees policy ensures that traders can maximize their returns without deductions for transaction fees, enhancing profitability. Plus, if you regularly indulge in Binance P2P trading, you can even earn using the frequent disparities between the buying and selling prices of USDT or any other supported crypto. Binance P2P is generally considered safe. It uses an escrow service to hold the cryptocurrencies until both parties confirm the transaction’s completion, providing a layer of security against fraud. However, there has been a recent rise in the number of P2P-led scams, with some buyers sending disputed funds to the sellers, leading to the latter being targeted by the authorities. Even though Binance doesn’t explicitly offer P2P services in the U.S. due to regulatory challenges, some users rely on VPNs to locate cash-based zones. However, this is not safe and not recommended considering Binance’s sophisticated location-tracking tools.

106::https://blockworks.co/news/coinbase-blockchain-association-fincen-mixers::Blockworks::article::Coinbase, Blockchain Association challenge FinCEN’s proposed mixer crackdown ::FinCEN’s proposed rule could stigmatize legitimate crypto activity and drive illicit transactions abroad, Blockchain Association says.::FinCEN’s proposed rule could stigmatize legitimate crypto activity and drive illicit transactions abroad, Blockchain Association says Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith | DAS 2022 for Blockworks Several industry players have objected to a federal agency’s attempt to crack down on crypto mixing services, with one advocacy group calling the proposal “fundamentally flawed.” The US Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) proposed in October to classify what it calls convertible virtual currency mixing, or CVC mixing, as “a class of transactions of primary money laundering concern.” The proposal is FinCEN’s first-ever use of its authority to target a transactions class as such. Read more: FinCEN seeks tighter controls on crypto mixing services Mixing is a process that blends different crypto transactions to obscure the original source — making it more difficult to trace specific transactions. FinCEN director Andrea Gacki said in an October statement that crypto mixing “allows players in the ransomware ecosystem, rogue state actors and other criminals to fund their unlawful activities and obfuscate the flow of ill-gotten gains.” Marisa Coppel, head of legal at Blockchain Association, said in a statement that FinCEN’s proposal is “far too broad in scope and application.” In a Jan. 22 letter responding to the proposal, the Blockchain Association argued that FinCEN’s failure to consider the many legitimate uses of crypto mixing makes it “makes it impossible for the agency to rationally conclude that the class is of primary money laundering concern.” “CVC mixing protocols help law-abiding individuals achieve on the otherwise public blockchain the privacy typical of transactions in the traditional banking system,” the group wrote. “There is nothing inherently suspicious about desiring the same degree of privacy available for traditional financial transactions.” FinCEN’s decision to impose reporting requirements on CVC mixing transactions “will stigmatize broad swathes of legitimate digital asset activity, impose significant costs on the digital asset industry and drive illicit digital asset transactions abroad,” Blockchain Association added. Coinbase also challenged the proposal in a Jan. 22 letter. The crypto exchange noted that regulated virtual asset service providers (VASPs) are already required to file suspicious activity reports on illicit mixing activity. “The NPRM fails to explain why these existing requirements are inadequate to FinCEN’s purposes,” Coinbase wrote. The company added in the letter that the FinCEN proposal does not include any monetary threshold for record-keeping and reporting obligations — leading to “bulk reporting of data of little help to law enforcement.” FinCEN could not immediately be reached. The FinCEN proposal comes after the US Treasury Department added decentralized cryptocurrency mixing service Tornado Cash to its sanctions list in August 2022. A year later, the company’s co-founders, Roman Semenov and Roman Storm, were charged with US federal money laundering and sanctions violations. Read more: Tornado Cash plaintiffs seek appeals after federal court losses Coinbase is no stranger to challenging federal agencies amid a broader crackdown on the crypto space. The publicly traded crypto company remains in a legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission after the regulator last year sued Coinbase for allegedly operating as an unregistered exchange — claims the company has denied. “This [proposal] comes at a time of enormous opportunity for the United States to lead the world in digital asset innovation,” Coinbase wrote in its latest letter to FinCEN. “But this opportunity depends in significant part on US regulators, like FinCEN, creating a regulatory landscape that fosters the growth of compliant companies while holding accountable those that fail to meet their obligations.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

Last month, a significant increase in the sale of freshly mined Bitcoin by public miners was recorded. Reports indicate that 13 major mining companies sold more Bitcoin than they generated in October, despite the cryptocurrency’s 26% gain for the month. Data from TheMinerMag reveal that the sell-to-production ratio for key players, such as Marathon Digital Holdings and Core Scientific Inc., breached the 100% mark. This suggests they not only sold all of their Bitcoin mined in October but also dipped into their existing reserves. Companies like Hut 8 and Bit Digital went even further, liquidating over 300% of their mined Bitcoin in the same month. This leap to a 105% sell-to-production ratio marks a sharp contrast to the 64%, 77%, and 77% ratios seen in July, August, and September respectively. Bitcoin miners are gearing up for the upcoming halving event. The reason for this accelerated sell-off is twofold: to take advantage of the recent price rise of Bitcoin and to engage in strategic financial preparation before the next “halving” expected early the following year. The halving event will cut the rewards for mining Bitcoin by half, prompting miners to bolster their cash reserves by selling a portion of their Bitcoin assets. By increasing their BTC sales, miners are proactively strengthening their financial standings to cope with the soon-to-decrease mining rewards. This careful planning is crucial for maintaining their operational flow and securing a sustainable future in the unpredictable crypto market. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

Fostering development::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Bitcoin (BTC) miners might turn to the DePIN ecosystem to turn mining facilities profitable after the latest halving cut block rewards to 3.125 BTC, shared Livepeer CEO Doug Petkanics with Crypto Briefing. DePIN is short for decentralized physical infrastructure network, a blockchain industry sector that brings transparency and decentralization to the real world. Petkanics highlights that this movement to DePIN, where the business model is usually providing computing power through GPUs to artificial intelligence-focused companies, is met with good and bad news for Bitcoin miners. “The hardware that they’ve bought and deployed and paid for Bitcoin mining are really specific to Bitcoin. Their ASICs, they can only mine Bitcoin. They can only do that specific cash function. They really can’t be redeployed into other networks. I think that’s the bad news. But that’s not surprising. That’s what they knew their investment was and they knew they were optimizing for.” On the opposite side, the expertise and surrounding infrastructure that the facilities built up around mining crypto are really efficient when it comes to energy usage, bandwidth, and operational management, Petkanics points out. This characteristics can be proven useful when managing a The expectation after the April 20 halving is that electricity and overall production costs will nearly double, according to a report by asset management firm CoinShares. The report also sheds light on that mining companies like BitDigital, Hive, and Hut 8 are already generating income from artificial intelligence (AI). “All that expertise and resources absolutely can be repurposed into one of the sort of biggest opportunities of this point in time that we’re in right now, due to the just massive amount of computing resources that are going to be required when it comes to this paradigm shift of artificial intelligence models being this new technology that’s changing everything about how people interact with technology.” According to Livepeer CEO, decentralized computing power networks offer benefits in different layers. The first is related to how the GPU market is organized, where tech firms must buy large batches of graphic chips to achieve a cheaper acquisition price. However, these companies usually don’t have immediate usage for all the GPU acquired, and that’s where DePIN shows its potential by letting computing power be lent. “I think that actually fits really neatly into this notion that decentralized networks can let anyone who’s paid for that capacity, but has it sitting idle, make it available to developers that want to use it temporarily via open marketplaces.” Moreover, the necessity to buy large batches of GPU is also a threshold to companies such as data centers and infrastructure providers. This is also another issue that can be solved by DePIN, as these smaller companies can tap into the dormant capacities of these idle graphic chips via an open marketplace, Petkanics underscored. “You don’t have the overhead or the bureaucracy of needing contracts and customer relationships and sales and the stuff that adds a lot of cost on top of just sort of connecting directly to the computing power.” Share this article The information on or accessed through this website is obtained from independent sources we believe to be accurate and reliable, but Decentral Media, Inc. makes no representation or warranty as to the timeliness, completeness, or accuracy of any information on or accessed through this website.

109::https://theconversation.com/the-utopian-currency-bitcoin-is-a-potentially-catastrophic-energy-guzzler-88871::The Conversation::article::The ‘utopian’ currency Bitcoin is a potentially catastrophic energy guzzler::Bitcoin has been viewed as a liberating path out of the corporate monetary system. But the process of ‘mining’ the cryptocurrency is a massive energy drain - and potential environmental disaster.::The recent upsurge in the price of Bitcoin seems to have finally awakened the world to the massively destructive environmental consequences of this bubble. These consequences were pointed out as long ago as 2013 by Australian sustainability analyst and entrepreneur Guy Lane, executive director of the Long Future Foundation. In recent months, the Bitcoin bubble has got massively bigger and the associated waste of energy is now much more widely recognised. In essence, the creation of a new Bitcoin requires the performance of a complex calculation that has no value except to show that it has been done. The crucial feature, as is common in cryptography, is that the calculation in question is very hard to perform but easy to verify once it’s done. At present, the most widely used estimate of the energy required to “mine” Bitcoins is comparable to the electricity usage of New Zealand, but this is probably an underestimate. If allowed to continue unchecked in our current energy-constrained, climate-threatened world, Bitcoin mining will become an environmental disaster. In the early days of Bitcoin, the necessary computations could be performed on ordinary personal computers. But now, “miners” use purpose-built machines optimised for the particular algorithms used by Bitcoin. With these machines, the primary cost of the system is the electricity used to run it. That means, of course, that the only way to be profitable as a Bitcoin miner is to have access to the cheapest possible electricity. Read more: Demystifying the blockchain: a basic user guide Most of the time that means electricity generated by burning cheap coal in old plants, where the capital costs have long been written off. Bitcoin mining today is concentrated in China, which still relies heavily on coal. Even in a large grid, with multiple sources of electricity, Bitcoin mining effectively adds to the demand for coal-fired power. Bitcoin computers run continuously, so they constitute a “baseload” demand, which matches the supply characteristics of coal. More generally, even in a process of transition to renewables, any increase in electricity demand at the margin may be regarded as slowing the pace at which the dirtiest coal-fired plants can be shut down. So Bitcoin mining is effectively slowing our progress towards a clean energy transition - right at the very moment we need to be accelerating. A widely used estimate by Digiconomist suggests that the Bitcoin network currently uses around 30 terawatt-hours (TWh) a year, or 0.1% of total world consumption – more than the individual energy use of more than 150 countries. By contrast, in his 2013 analysis, Guy Lane estimated that a Bitcoin price of US$10,000 would see that energy use figure climb to 80 TWh. If the current high price is sustained for any length of time, Lane’s estimate will be closer to the mark, and perhaps even conservative. The cost of electricity is around 5c per kilowatt-hour for industrial-scale users. Miners with higher costs have mostly gone out of business. As a first approximation, Bitcoin miners will spend resources (nearly all electricity) equal to the price of a new Bitcoin. However, to be conservative, let’s assume that only 75% of the cost of Bitcoin mining arises from electricity. Assuming an electricity price of 5c per kWh and a Bitcoin price of US$10,000, this means that each Bitcoin consumes about 150 megawatt-hours of electricity. Under current rules, the settings for Bitcoin allow the mining of 1,800 Bitcoins a day, implying daily use of 24,000MWh or an annual rate of nearly 100TWh – about 0.3% of all global electricity use. Roughly speaking, each MWh of coal-fired electricity generation is associated with a tonne of carbon dioxide emissions, so a terawatt-hour corresponds to a million tonnes of CO₂. An obvious comparison is with the existing financial system. Digiconomics estimated that Visa is massively more efficient in processing transactions. A supporter of Bitcoin, Carlos Domingo, hit back with a calculation suggesting that the entire global financial system uses about 100TWh per year, or three times as much as the Diginconomics estimate for Bitcoin. As a defence, this is far from impressive. First, as we’ve seen, if the current high price is sustained, total annual energy use from Bitcoin mining is also likely to rise to 100TWh. Read more: The bitcoin and blockchain: energy hogs More importantly, the global financial system serves the entire world. By contrast, the number of active Bitcoin investors has been estimated at 3 million. Almost all of these people are pure speculators, holding Bitcoin as an asset while using the standard financial system for all of their private and business transactions. Another group is believed to use Bitcoin for illicit purposes such as drug dealing or money laundering, before converting these funds into their own national currency. The number of people who routinely use Bitcoin as a currency for legitimate transactions might be in the low thousands or perhaps even fewer. Shifting the whole global financial system to Bitcoin would require at least a 2000-fold increase, which in turn would entail increasing the the world’s electricity use by around 500%. With the current threat of climate change looming large globally - this constitutes an unthinkably large amount of energy consumption. The disastrous nature of Bitcoin’s energy consumption should not lead us to abandon the associated idea of blockchain technology altogether. There are alternatives to the “proof of work” method of validating changes to the blockchain, such as “proof of importance”, which is analogous to Google’s page ranking systems. Projects such as Gridcoin are based on calculations that are actually useful to science. But these ideas are in their infancy. For the moment, the problem is Bitcoin and how to deal with it. There is no obvious way to fix the inherent problems in its design. The sooner this collective delusion comes to an end, the better.::2017-12-11T04:58:07Z::Bitcoin, Climate change, Electricity::John Quiggin::Environment ,  Energy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/198475/original/file-20171211-27719-sl548l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

If approved, the Monochrome Bitcoin ETF could be the first spot bitcoin ETF in Australia which allows direct holding of bitcoin. Australia already has two exchange-traded products providing exposure to spot crypto assets on Cboe Australia but they do not hold bitcoin directly. The Monochrome Bitcoin ETF is a flagship product of the firm. It could have also been listed with Cboe Australia's larger rival, ASX, where larger volumes are available. In January 2024, Monochrome Asset Management's head of legal and compliance Derek Vladimir Henningsen told CoinDesk that they anticipated their bitcoin ETF would be listed in the second quarter of the year. The announcement said the firm selected Cboe Australia as the listing venue for its bitcoin ETF because it aligns with its strategic goals to work with a market operator with an established reputation, strategic position and expertise across Asia, and broader investor access. In Australia, unlike the U.S., firms have to first get approval from the regulator, the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC), and then apply to an exchange for listing the product. Monochrome has already got approval from ASIC for its product. "We expect a decision from Cboe Australia about our bitcoin ETF application before the middle of the year," said Jeff Yew, Monochrome Asset Management CEO.

To learn more on how we evaluate each piece of content, please proceed to our verification methodology page LocalMonero, the platform that facilitated anonymous, no-KYC, P2P Monero (XMR) trades, has announced it is shutting down. And with it goes one of the last remaining bastions of truly anonymous P2P crypto services. The shuttering of the platform has expectedly raised concerns for privacy-conscious traders and investors as they scramble to find LocalMonero alternatives. In 2024, options are somewhat limited due to the relentless crackdown by global financial regulators on privacy coins and services. However, there are still a few LocalMonero alternatives out there that you may want to try out. Let’s take a quick look at some of these options. Everything was more or less normal with LocalMonero until May 7, 2024, when the platform announced that it was time to wind up operations permanently. LocalMonero didn’t offer any specific rationale behind the decision, although it briefly mentioned that a mix of “internal and external factors” led to it. While the announcement didn’t make any such reference, it is believed that growing hostility against privacy-centric crypto and blockchain products likely played a big role in forcing that move. Another domino is falling… 😥LocalMonero, the essential marketplace for buying/selling XMR peer-to-peer, is closing down without giving a reason. 🫡 https://t.co/788cFxdvjA So, where does it leave LocalMonero users now? Here’s a roundup: Essentially, the shutdown is effective immediately. Therefore, it’s crucial to find suitable LocalMonero alternatives quickly if you want to continue enjoying privacy-focused features for your XMR trades. LocalMonero has been a trusted platform for buying and selling XMR since 2017. Several factors contributed to its immense popularity. These include its ability to allow anonymous transactions while being backed by an end-to-end encryption messaging system. The platform hosted a wide spectrum of global traders, offering varying rates and payment options. You could filter buy and sell offers by your preferred country, payment method, and desired fiat/crypto pair. So make sure that whichever LocalMonero alternative you switch to offers most of these advantages — if not all. Primarily, you should look for a platform that: Additionally, the ideal LocalMonero alternative should offer you the option to buy and sell XMR for fiat. As of May 2024, not many LocalMonero alternatives meet these criteria. A tightening regulatory grip on privacy coins has squeezed some previously compliant platforms to abandon their user-friendly, anonymous approach when it comes to XMR and P2P. So, with those factors in mind, we do have to remind you that there are no real alternatives to LocalMonero — not yet, at least. These listed options are only those that come close. Bisq is definitely the closest it gets when it comes to LocalMonero alternatives. It is a decentralized trading platform that allows you to buy and sell XMR relatively easily. However, the interface is probably not as beginner-friendly as LocalMonero’s offering. Bisq doesn’t require you to go through KYC processes. It has a decent amount of liquidity for XMR trades — not nearly as high as what LocalMonero used to offer, but the odds are high that it will get there eventually, considering it is one of the few remaining options as of May 2024. Trades involving altcoins on Bisq typically have a default settlement period of one day. However, for those seeking faster transactions, Bisq offers an “Altcoins Instant” account option, which reduces the trade period to just one hour. This option is crucial for traders prioritizing speed and efficiency in their XMR transactions. The platform requires that Monero sellers actively provide proof of payment. This proof includes a transaction key, transaction ID, and the recipient’s address. This unique approach is required because Monero’s stringent privacy features obscure certain transaction details on the blockchain, which, in turn, complicates dispute resolution. Sellers can generate the proof from several compatible Monero wallets, including the official Monero GUI and CLI wallets, among others. Overall, this process ensures that in the event of a dispute, mediators or arbitrators have the necessary information to make a fair judgment. Bisq streamlines Monero transactions with an automated confirmation feature, expediting the verification of XMR payments. This feature eliminates the manual verification process for the buyer, which means the process only requires a valid transaction key from the seller and activation of this setting by the buyer. That said, manual confirmation remains an option if you prefer more old-school methods. Heads up before you read any further: Despite TradeOgre’s established presence and user base, the platform has raised red flags on multiple occasions in the past. It has faced criticism for its lack of transparency, and there have even been claims of users losing money due to alleged malpractices. So, make sure to do your research before trusting the TradeOgre with your money. The platform appears on this list because it is one of the few no-KYC platforms around that still supports XMR. The platform has been around since 2018. It claims to prioritize user anonymity and, therefore, doesn’t require any KYC verification. TradeOgre supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies, including XMR. It offers a simple, minimalistic user interface that makes processes easy for new users. It’s not the prettiest or the most modern interface, but it is functional and straightforward. You can buy XMR on TradeOgre using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or USDT. However, the platform does not support transactions via PayPal or credit cards. You only need an email address and a password to register. Once registered, you can deposit a compatible cryptocurrency and trade for Monero directly on the exchange. Additionally, users can store their Monero on TradeOgre or withdraw it to a private wallet if they are not actively trading. However, you can not buy Monero with physical cash directly through TradeOgre. Haveno is a promising but incomplete LocalMonero alternative. In fact, the LocalMonero shutdown announcement even mentioned it as one of the upcoming platforms to look out for. “Fortunately, the Monero ecosystem has matured a lot over these years, and with the imminent launch of Haveno and other DEXs like Serai, atomic swaps, the coming addition of FCMP (full blockchain anonymity set replacing rings of 16) as well as the continuing and rapidly accelerating development of the Monero protocol, we’re confident that Monero’s future is bright, with or without our platform.” Put simply, Haveno is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that leverages Monero’s privacy features to offer anonymous and secure trading. Haveno provides a platform for exchanging cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether, and Bitcoin Cash with fiat currencies such as USD, EUR, and GBP, all paired against XMR. The exchange is designed to be non-custodial, meaning users can retain control of their funds without undergoing KYC. As of May 2024, Haveno is still in development and not yet fully operational for public use. It’s anticipated to be ready by the end of 2024. The documentation for the Mainnet was released on May 12, 2024 — so there is a fair amount of work still to be done. If you have the skills, please consider jumping into the @HavenoDEX project to get the app developed to continue LocalMonero's cash in-person mission Desktop Haveno main net was technically released, but work remains, and the network is not standing up yet https://t.co/qlf9oxzq52 The platform will support a range of payment methods that do not require a bank account, like cash in person or cash by mail, which may greatly enhance its accessibility for peer-to-peer transactions. All said, Haveno remains a work in progress. Its future as a reliable trading platform depends on the completion of development and community acceptance. As this guide shows, Bisq stands out as the closest real LocalMonero alternative. Platforms like TradeOgre (despite its user base) and the in-development Haveno, while promising, lack the complete package LocalMonero provided. The abrupt closure of LocalMonero has certainly stirred significant activity within the privacy coin community. Regulatory pressure might be rising, but it’s also likely to further fuel innovation and ingenuity. There’s a strong likelihood that we will witness a surge of new platforms attempting to address these challenges and emerge as viable LocalMonero alternatives. We will continue to monitor these developments closely to keep you posted on any significant progress. Until then, weigh your options carefully before going all in. Peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto trading allows for direct transactions between individuals without the need for a centralized intermediary. This method of trading improves privacy and reduces transaction costs. P2P trades also offer greater control over the terms of trade and potentially better pricing due to the competitive nature of the marketplace. Additionally, P2P platforms often support a wide range of payment methods, making them accessible to a broader audience. When it comes to the best Monero trading platform, ideally you want something that doesn’t require KYC. Keep in mind that you will likely come across many “no-KYC” platforms that will later require you to go through KYC verification to access XMR transactions (or perhaps even their P2P services). No, LocalMonero did not require users to complete KYC procedures. This feature was key to its appeal as it allowed users to trade Monero anonymously, which was fitting for the privacy coin’s privacy-centric priorities.

112::https://blockworks.co/news/parallelized-evms-gaining-popularity::Blockworks::article::Parallelized EVMs are gaining popularity, but they won't scale blockchains alone::Parallel execution is a small fraction of the bigger picture.::Parallel execution is a small fraction of the bigger picture absemetov/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks Improving technology for scaling blockchains requires tackling multifaceted problems. New attempts to parallelize the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) have gained interest in recent weeks, as developers look for possibilities to increase transaction throughput. The EVM is the execution environment that runs on Ethereum and its layer-2 rollups, and also has been adopted by other layer-1 networks such Avalanche, Binance Chain and many others, which use it to process smart contract code. In typical EVM implementations, transactions are processed one after the other in the order they arrive. This simple approach can lead to longer processing times and higher costs when there are many transactions, explains Marina Guryeva, the CEO of Neon Labs, which is implementing the EVM as a smart contract on Solana. “For Ethereum, the traditional sequential execution model simplifies hardware requirements, but on the downside, it creates limitations in handling the increasing volume of transactions,” Guryeva told Blockworks. “This worsens during peak usage times resulting in longer transaction wait times, higher gas fees vis-a-vis demand surge, and an overall fractured user experience.” Guryeva said that much of the growing interest in parallel EVMs is due to its ability to tackle these challenges around blockchain scalability, addressing issues related to the blockchain trilemma. “The parallel processing approach addresses the longstanding challenges of scalability and transaction processing efficiency within the Ethereum network,” Guryeva said. Many transactions can be processed at the same time, instead of sequentially, so long as they don’t depend on each other. There are other ways to achieve parallel processing, such as at the database-level with approaches such as sharding, that essentially divide Ethereum’s state into smaller “shards” but full sharding remains years away. Read more: Dencun and Pralectra: Ethereum core devs chart an ambitious 2024 Parallelized EVMs, however, including the likes of Sei network, Monad and Neon, are already production ready or nearly so. The Sei network launched its mainnet in August 2023 and has seen recent monthly trading volume of about $136 million with a little over 29 thousand active DEX users, according to data compiled by Flipside Crypto. Its native token, SEI, has surged from around $0.23 at the beginning of December to around $0.68 today — an almost 200% jump. Neon too, has seen a significant increase in its token price, with NEON trading from $0.50 on Dec. 1 to roughly $2.55 today. Monad has yet to launch and does not yet have its own token. Much of the work being done on the Neon EVM is to bring the Ethereum dapps into the Solana ecosystem, Guryeva said. “It is a fully compatible Ethereum environment on Solana and allows developers to scale Ethereum dapps using Solana as the settlement layer,” she said. Guryeva notes that Ethereum remains the dominant blockchain that supports smart contracts and dapps, but Solana’s Sealevel technology — which enables virtual machines to process multiple transactions simultaneously through distributing transaction workload across multiple threads on a validator’s hardware — enables lower gas fees and higher scalability. Jay Jog the co-founder of Sei Labs shares this sentiment, he notes that Ethereum rollups struggle to get over 30 sustained transactions per second, which limits the design space on the blockchain. “A parallelized EVM lets you get the best of Ethereum and Solana — the EVM and all of the mindshare/tooling around it and the fast execution environment that Solana offers,” he said. Sei’s latest version has its EVM built into the chain, Jog added. “Sei uses Geth — the Go implementation of the EVM — to get full EVM bytecode compatibility. Geth is very battle tested and currently processes ~85% of [Ethereum] blocks,” he said. This is different from its competitor Monad, which is creating a custom EVM implementation, Jog notes. Despite these differences, both Monad and Sei are using optimistic parallel execution to achieve parallel processing. With this technique, virtual machines run in parallel on separate threads within the network computer. Each thread would execute transactions and generate what Keone Hon, the co-founder and CEO of Monad Labs, calls “pending results.” These pending results track the inputs and outputs of the transactions which are then committed back into their original linear order. If any pending result has inputs that have been invalidated, then a transaction must be rescheduled. “This means that Monad still supports linear blocks and linear transactions within the blocks,” Hon told Blockworks. “Monad can basically take transaction formats that are exactly the same as Ethereum and then, under the hood, implement parallelism without any changes from the user perspective.” Optimistic parallel execution is different from what Solana uses, for example, where dapps have to pre-specify dependencies of the transactions, Hon said, analogous to the access list approach on Ethereum. It is important to note, Hon adds, that parallel execution is a small fraction of the bigger picture, with Monad’s more general mission being centered around accelerating EVM execution to make it as performant as possible. “The real bottleneck is actually the state access that all of those transactions are being run, they all have dependencies on state, and that state lives on SSD (solid-state drive),” Hon said. The majority of smart contract work has relatively simple computation, he said, and bigger constraints for smart contracts are often the input/output component — the process of reading from the SSD and then writing back data. Parallelism only cuts a small fraction of costs, according to Rachel Bousfield, the tech lead at Offchain Labs, because parallel execution is rarely possible in practice across current Web3 dapps. Ethereum-like blockchains generally use commodity databases for reading and writing data. These have the advantage of being widely accessible, purchased “off the shelf,” but they are not optimized for the problem of storing the Merkle tree data, necessary for parallel processing on the blockchain, Hon notes. This means that, fundamentally, in order to decrease transaction processing times and gas prices, infrastructure around the database will have to change. “So one of the other really major things that Monad is building is a custom state database from scratch that supports parallel access so that when there are many threads running in parallel, touching the database — to get inputs, or write outbacks back to it — those can proceed in parallel,” Hon said. Monad is not alone in focusing on alleviating state dependencies. Sei too, is working to make improvements in this area, Jog notes. “We are doing a lot of work on the state layer to improve state access, state commit, and state storage,” he said.

Earlier this […]::The British Columbia Supreme Court has given the final judicial green light for the merger between Canadian Bitcoin mining heavyweight Hut 8 and U.S. Bitcoin Corp (USBTC), set to be finalized by the end of the year. This merger is expected to significantly influence both Bitcoin mining and the field of high-performance computing. Earlier this year, both companies announced plans to merge, subject to approvals from regulatory bodies and shareholders. The judicial approval was granted on September 18, clearing the last major legal hurdle. The emerging entity, provisionally dubbed “New Hut,” will be a publicly traded U.S. company that aims to significantly affect both Bitcoin mining and high-performance computing. It plans to operate with a capacity of 825 megawatts across six dedicated Bitcoin mining and data center sites, emphasizing the aggressive goals to become a major player in the Bitcoin mining sector. Before New Hut can officially launch, several remaining steps must be fulfilled, including a critical approval from USBTC shareholders. Upon finalization of the merger, New Hut’s stock will be available on both the Nasdaq and Toronto Stock Exchanges, trading under the ticker “HUT.” Shareholders will also need to complete administrative tasks to own shares of New Hut’s common stock. In terms of impact, the merger could boost the combined firm’s mining capabilities. Hut 8 and USBTC are among the biggest crypto mining companies in North America. Parallel to the merger developments, Hut 8 has also revised its operational plans. The company recently moved 6,400 ASIC mining rigs from an inactive facility in Ontario to Texas due to legal issues with energy provider Validus Power, reflecting Hut 8’s commitment to addressing increasing demands in fields like artificial intelligence and high-performance computing. Therefore, if all goes as planned, New Hut is poised to become a leading entity in the fast-changing worlds of Bitcoin mining and specialized computing. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

114::https://cryptobriefing.com/gnosis-genome-naming-service/::Crypto Briefing::article::Gnosis opens public registration for Genome naming service::Gnosis introduces Genome Naming Service, extending ENS for seamless Web3 identity.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Gnosis, a blockchain infrastructure project advocating for radical inclusivity, has announced the launch of Genome, a digital ID service native to the Gnosis Chain. Public Registration is now live! 🚀 Missed the pre-registration? No worries – now ANYONE can register their .gno domains: https://t.co/afo44sro6d https://t.co/zxHpOnvmfZ — Genome (.gno domains) (@genomedomains) May 15, 2024 Developed in collaboration with Web3 domain and identity platform SpaceID and Web3 messaging protocol dm3, Genome allows users to translate their lengthy, technical wallet addresses into human-readable names, making it easier to send and receive transactions and interact within the Gnosis ecosystem. Genome automatically grants users ownership of both .GNO and .gnosis.eth names, providing a seamless, interoperable user journey within Gnosis across EVM-compatible blockchains. The service synchronizes across Gnosis dApps, communities, and social networks, giving users a single identity and login that they can use across various services. Genome is also fully interoperable with the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), enabling users to claim ownership of two domain names simultaneously. “From payments to gaming to SocialFi, if Web3 is going to fulfill its promises, we need to accelerate interoperable on-chain communication and identification tools,” shares Friederike Ernst, co-founder of Gnosis. Genome is integrated with various applications on Gnosis Chain, such as Gnosis Pay and Circles, as well as other blockchain utilities like Blockscout and NiftyFair. The integration ensures that users are able to maintain a consistent identity across multiple platforms, enhancing interoperability. According to Ralph Xu, a Business Development Specialist at Gnosis, the main differentiator between Genome .gno domains and other products is the custom ENS resolver developed by the DM3 Protocol team. The resolver pairs the .gno domain on Gnosis Chain with a corresponding subdomain on Ethereum, allowing one to be the extension of the other on a different chain. This is made possible through CCIP L2 (cross-chain interoperability) and off-chain resolution, which points to an off-chain server and then to the smart contracts on Gnosis Chain, relaying the information back to Ethereum. The launch of Genome aligns with Gnosis’ vision of inclusivity through accessible, open infrastructure. The project has opened registration for a .gno or .gnosis.eth username to the public.

115::https://theconversation.com/bitcoin-may-be-reaching-new-heights-but-the-asx-shows-the-blockchain-is-reinventing-business-88937::The Conversation::article::Bitcoin may be reaching new heights, but the ASX shows the blockchain is reinventing business::While everyone has heard of Bitcoin, the real potential in the blockchain is only just starting to be unlocked.::Bitcoin may be the most famous example of a blockchain in use, but it is actually a rather unimaginative way to use it. The blockchain is finally starting to fulfil its promise as a game-changing technology, a kind of infrastructure for record-keeping. To facilitate movement of value (such as money) and changes in ownership (shares, for example), and even to manage online identities. The Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) has announced that it will use a blockchain-based system to record who owns shares of listed companies, and to keep track of transactions and settlements when people buy and sell shares. The move comes as the price of Bitcoin has risen more than US$14,000 in the past year. Yet Bitcoin does not really exploit the new databases and record-keeping infrastructure that blockchain technology makes possible. Read more: Demystifying the blockchain: a basic user guide The blockchain is also called a “public” or “distributed” ledger. Think of a spreadsheet that is publicly available to view, and simultaneously held on numerous computers. When someone transfers a Bitcoin, it is verified by the system, encrypted, and a new line (or “block”) is added to the spreadsheet. The ASX’s blockchain will replace the ASX’s CHESS (Clearing House Electronic Sub-registry System) system. Currently, the ASX requires each trade to be verified against the ASX’s centralised database of ownership records and reconciled with payments. So while trades take place in fractions of a second, the actual clearance (making sure who owns what) and settlement (the transfer of money and shares) is cumbersome, slow, expensive, and prone to human error. The ASX’s blockchain will greatly simplify this process. Instead of having to reconcile trades against a centralised database, the verification of ownership and settling of accounts can be done directly between participants (as is done with Bitcoin trades). This is much simpler, faster and more secure. Read more: What's holding up the blockchain? The fact that the ASX’s blockchain announcement made headlines around the world shows what a big leap forward this is. The ASX’s blockchain will streamline the settlement process, improving productivity and therefore reducing costs in the Australian stock market. This means that our financial markets will work better, offering an immediate benefit to Australia’s economy. Exchanges are also a global business, and the adoption of blockchain technology in Australia’s major exchange means that it has a competitive edge over other exchanges. Companies choose where to list, based on a variety of factors including the quality of the exchange technology. More business for the ASX will translate into more local jobs. One potential downside of the ASX adopting the blockchain, however, is that some workers who currently process settlements on the ASX may lose their jobs. Some financial companies that currently benefit from the slow settlement process, such as brokerage firms, will also lose out. Read more: Blockchain really only does one thing well But the ASX’s move is just scratching the surface of what blockchain technology can do to the Australian financial sector. The same argument that applies to the ASX - that the blockchain is more efficient and productive than existing record-keeping and transaction processes - can also be extended to other exchanges, such as bond markets. In other words, the ASX’s blockchain is just the beginning of a technological transformation of Australia’s financial markets. Blockchains will also make these exchanges more attractive to build services on, such as for managing wealth. This is a further benefit for consumers and the broader finance industry, not purely from lower prices also from the possibility of new products and services. Read more: The blockchain does not eliminate the need for trust But how is any of this even possible in the first place? Part of the credit must go to Australian regulators. They created the environment for this huge shift in technological practice. Australia is now leading the adoption of the blockchain, despite it being a US-built technology. It is similar to how African telecommunications companies are leading the way in mobile payments, even though Finland created modern mobile phones with companies like Nokia. Even if you’re not excited about new technology in the Australian finance industry, its global competitiveness, or even our regulatory agility, the ASX announcement is a harbinger of what adoption of blockchain technology will increasingly look like.::2017-12-11T03:34:04Z::ASX, Australian stock exchange, Bitcoin, Blockchain, Chess, provenance::Jason Potts::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/198457/original/file-20171211-27714-avdewj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C253%2C3199%2C1599&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

But in May 2022, the UST de-pegged and began a death spiral that eventually took down the entire Terra ecosystem, wiping out approximately $40 billion in market value in its wake. During its case, the SEC argued that Kwon and, under his direction, Terraform Labs deceived everyday investors about the nature of that algorithm, implying that it allowed UST to “naturally heal” and “automatically self-heal” in the event of a de-peg. But there was no self-healing or algorithmic magic that kept UST pegged to the dollar, the SEC argued. Instead, the value of UST was maintained through continuous trading activity, including large-scale trading done by institutional investors. During her closing arguments on Friday, SEC attorney Laura Meehan told the jury that during a prior de-peg in May 2021, Kwon and Terraform Labs made a “secret agreement” with Jump, a trading shop that acted as a market maker for Terraform Labs, to step in and buy millions of dollars of UST off-chain to inflate the value and bring it back to parity with the dollar. Meehan added that after Jump’s intervention, Kwon and his company intentionally kept Jump’s involvement quiet, wanting instead to use the re-pegging as evidence of the algorithm’s effectiveness. “Defendants lied for years. They lied about the success and size of their blockchain … they lied about the stability of their algorithm,” Meehan said. “They’re still parading themselves around like they’re a real company, like they’re legitimate.” As Meehan neared the end of her remarks, the Manhattan courtroom gently shook – not, as District Court Judge Jed Rakoff quipped, “with the force of the SEC’s arguments” but with the tremors of a 4.8 magnitude earthquake in neighboring New Jersey. Lawyers for Terraform Labs and Do Kwon made their closing arguments after the SEC, pausing intermittently as emergency alerts for the earthquake periodically sounded from cell phones across the courtroom. The defense, led by attorney Louis Pellegrino, told the jury that the mobile payment app Chai did, in fact, utilize the Terra blockchain for a variety of things, including refunding purchases and providing liquidity. But mostly, Pellegrino’s argument focused on the alleged “secret agreement” between Jump and Terraform Labs, and whether or not Kwon and his company had actually lied to investors about the nature of the algorithm. “The mechanism was not a computer that functioned on its own,” Pellegrino said. “It wasn’t some magical machine…and everyone knew it.” Minting-and-burning to maintain the peg had to be done by market participants, he argued, and Kwon and Terraform Labs had “never claimed” otherwise. Those market participants included companies like Jump – which Pellegrino said had a formal agreement, not a secret one, to provide liquidity to Terraform Labs when needed. “All reasonable purchasers knew about the risks,” Pellegrino argued, pointing to a trading memo from Galaxy Digital citing the inherent risk of a collapse of the ecosystem. When that collapse eventually came, Pellegrino said, it was as the result of a devastating short attack – carried out by hedge funds including Wintermute Trading, Celsius, and Jane Street – that made Terraform Labs a victim alongside its investors. “Terraform is still here, trying to make things better,” Pellegrino said. “Terraform is no house of cards.” Terraform Labs filed for bankruptcy protection in January. During his testimony earlier this week, current CEO Chris Amani testified that the company had approximately $150 million in assets remaining and that he made an annual salary of $3 million. Former CEO and defendant Do Kwon was absent from court for the duration of the trial. Kwon remains in Montenegro, where he has been since his March 2023 arrest for using fake Costa Rican travel documents en route to Dubai after months on the lam. Kwon served a prison sentence for his crime but was released on bail and placed under house arrest in the Balkan country last month. The country’s Supreme Court is currently weighing competing extradition requests from the U.S. and South Korea, Kwon’s native country, which both want to try him on criminal fraud charges in addition to civil ones. Kwon’s ultimate destination remains unclear. Read More: Do Kwon Released From Montenegrin Prison on Bail; Terraform Labs' Civil Trial Begins in NYC (coindesk.com) Edited by Jesse Hamilton.

Binance is a reliable peer-to-peer crypto exchange offering resources and tools for traders looking to buy and sell crypto between themselves. This guide demonstrates how to buy and sell USDT (or any other crypto) using Binance’s P2P trading interface. As USDT is a stablecoin, it is the nearest to any fiat currency you wish to off-ramp to in terms of steady pricing. Even for on-ramping, USDT is more like crypto cash, free of the inherent price volatility associated with other assets like Bitcoin, BNB, ETH, and more. Therefore, USDT/USD, USDT/INR, and other USDT-specific pairs are the most sought-after in the Binance P2P space. Here’s another reason why P2P platforms have garnered popularity, particularly in countries like India: “Indian Govt Collected ₹ 105 Cr in TDS on VDA transactions. In my opinion this is a pretty low number as high TDS led to most of the volumes shifting to offshore or P2P platforms. I believe this number could be at least 10-20x higher if a lower TDS rate (0.1% or 0.01%) was introduced, also serving the purpose of tracking and tracing VDA transactions.” As Gupta explains, a large chunk of crypto users shifted to P2P platforms in 2023 as direct trades between this community didn’t account for taxes. Even though purchasing USDT using P2P on Binance is relatively straightforward, there are a number of steps that can minimize headaches: Did you know? As someone looking to buy USDT on Binance P2P, you can even advertise the quantity you are willing to by along with the offered price. Sellers can use this data to filter, based on preferences. Now that the basic elements are out of the way, here are the steps to kickstart the transaction process: Unless you have already paid the sum, as a buyer, you are free to cancel the deal if you feel something is off with the seller. Sellers on Binance P2P have a more difficult task as they are the ones who receive the funds. Despite the challenges, there are several steps to follow to sell USDT easily: Note: A safe practice for sellers is to check for the buyers manually, as once matched, you, the seller, cannot cancel the order. What is a chargeback? For #Binance P2P transactions, a chargeback happens when your trade partner requests to have their funds back after you’ve completed the transaction. Swipe for tips on how to avoid them 👉 Once you are satisfied with everything, release the crypto from Binance’s escrow to the buyer’s account. Remember setting up a passkey earlier? This can help you transfer the assets in one click without having to feed in the multiple confirmation codes. However, never simply believe the screenshot. Confirm that you have received the amount in your account before releasing the crypto. Binance P2P buying and selling can also be initiated in cash via face-to-face transactions in specific regions. Still unsure about the Binance P2P framework? Refer to this detailed explainer to know more. It is natural for someone to change their mind midway through a P2P transaction. Regardless of the reasons, which are usually related to safety or price, here’s how to cancel a P2P order without any trouble. Do note that frequent cancellations can lead to negative feedback and may harm your reputation. If you do not want to sell crypto but the buyer has already made the payment, raise a dispute immediately. If a dispute arises due to cancellation, especially after the payment has been made, Binance’s dispute resolution system will intervene. It’s important to communicate clearly and provide valid reasons for cancellation in such cases. A Binance P2P merchant enjoys a host of perks. Note that not everyone can qualify. Here are the steps to become eligible: Notice how the requirements for becoming a merchant are pretty steep. If you are a frequent, high-volume trader, it is advisable to get merchant status. Also, it is worth mentioning that there are other Binance alternatives like OKX and more, which may have more lenient merchant programs. If you are looking to buy and sell crypto peer-to-peer, you might also want to consider those avenues. 🚀 Join Dustin as he shares on "How to safely use P2P". Worry no more when using P2P as Bybit has simple yet secure measures in place for all your transactions. 💫 Join now to become the Bybit Trader of the Year: https://t.co/nd5lYCVSlQ #BybitTraderof2024 #BybitVIP pic.twitter.com/3mVipMbQkg There is no shortage of competitors to Binance P2P. As outlined above, several leading global exchanges like OKX, Bybit, and more offer peer-to-peer trading services. Yet, learning the ins and outs of Binance’s peer-to-peer trading space is a smart move, considering the sheer popularity and user volume associated with the service. Note that Binance P2P trading is not just about following the steps and remembering guidelines. The trick is to continue executing trades until you are comfortable with the process and able to perfect every move while ensuring your assets remain safe and secure as you learn. Binance US doesn’t offer peer-to-peer trading services due to regulatory concerns. Currently, Binance US operates primarily as a crypto-only exchange and does not directly support fiat transactions for buying crypto. Users can deposit cryptocurrencies into their Binance US account and engage in crypto-to-crypto transactions to manage their digital assets. The Indian Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) has taken measures to block the URLs of Binance and several other crypto exchanges due to their failure to comply with India’s anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. The FIU issued formal notices to these entities, highlighting their non-compliance with mandatory record-keeping and suspicious transaction reporting as required under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). These actions are part of a wider initiative to ensure that all financial operators, including those located abroad but active in India, adhere strictly to local AML standards. Binance P2P does not charge users for buying or selling on its platform, which includes a variety of payment methods. This fee exemption makes Binance P2P an attractive option for those looking to buy crypto or sell crypto directly with others. The platform uses an escrow service to secure transactions, holding the cryptocurrency until both parties confirm the transaction, which enhances the security and reliability of Binance P2P trading. However, in countries like India, where TDS is implemented on every sell-side transaction, the platform might levy fees upfront, to be borne by the sellers. To buy crypto on Binance, you must get yourself verified, put out an advertisement if needed, or directly connect with the seller by relying on Binance’s order matching system. Binance P2P buying is a good way to on-ramp. Also, you can buy crypto like Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and more as well as USDT. Binance P2P selling lets you sell USDT or any other crypto, including Bitcoin (BTC) and some of the more popular picks for fiat. You can simply connect with the buyers automatically to sell crypto or search for the best price and buyer feedback manually before proceeding.

118::https://blockworks.co/news/we-need-to-stop-forcing-use-cases-on-blockchains::Blockworks::article::We need to stop forcing use cases on blockchains::Opinion: The idea that existing generic blockchains can later be molded for specific use cases lacks foresight.::The idea that existing generic blockchains can later be molded for specific use cases lacks foresight Midjourney modified by Blockworks Every industry is unique, with its own needs, quirks and customer demands. The Web3 industry is no exception — especially on the quirky front. The prevailing mode of action in the industry so far has been to build general-purpose blockchains in the hopes that folks will later build specific layer-2 functionalities for them. But the idea that existing generic blockchains can later be molded for specific use cases lacks foresight. We’ve made great progress with generalized blockchains like Ethereum, as the growth of DeFi and NFTs so clearly demonstrated. But that approach isn’t sustainable — scaling has been and still is one of Ethereum’s most challenging tasks. In order to correctly prepare for the future of blockchain and shape blockchains for the future, we need to stop anchoring our thinking in what already exists. Rather than maintaining established blockchains as the blueprint for specific apps and use cases, we need blockchains that are purpose-made and use case-driven. The era of generalized “smart contract platforms” is coming to a close. The space is already moving steadily in that direction. Appchain protocols like Polkadot, Cosmos and Avalanche are embracing the change in full. But even layer-2 rollups, the hottest chain narrative of the moment, are a first step towards this future of specialization. Optimism’s OP Stack is a clear contender as a framework for deploying custom EVM rollups. With time, additional capabilities beyond the EVM can be developed on rollups as well, as we’re seeing with Arbitrum’s Stylus. We’ve observed this drive towards specialization countless times: from smartphones, computers to social media and the hundreds of different SaaS platforms catering to specific niches. We need to remember that Web3, blockchain or crypto (whichever is your nickname of choice) are all-encompassing terms for an industry that is actually made up of dozens of sectors and niches. These sectors connect and collaborate (they interoperate!), forming a cohesive whole while maintaining their distinctive characteristics and use cases. Industry observers may point to many formerly successful companies as examples of how a myopic vision led to the demise of a number of former market leaders. Kodak, Blockbuster and Nokia all forfeited dominance to products that had better, more-attuned-to-consumer use cases with a clearer grasp of the future. The infrastructure for custom blockchain apps is in development, but now the burden is on app developers to start building them for their own custom uses. And this has the potential to unlock true adoption of blockchain as a means to an end — not the goal in itself. Take the example of Bitcoin. With Taproot and Ordinals, people have been trying to jerry-rig tokens and NFTs to the poor Bitcoin blockchain, which was never even close to being designed for such uses. It’s okay if Bitcoin is just a store of value and payments blockchain. Anything else would eventually be outcompeted by a blockchain specifically built for that purpose. In recent years, we’ve seen a true flourish of smart contract uses in the form of DeFi, GameFi and NFTs. Still, despite some undeniable success, all popular smart contract use cases involve some form of speculation, which becomes unreliable when market conditions are still infamously volatile (though secretly beloved). The types of future applications that will use custom blockchains will be varied, but in my view, it will be much more B2B focused than before. Many such uses are currently locked behind clunky infrastructure and expensive storage. For example, a blockchain for Big Data analytics incorporates the needs of data scientists for data warehousing, SQL, verifying outputs and much more. Imagine every industry has its own custom-built blockchain. There are already examples where this is working; IBM offers custom blockchain solutions for supply chain networks. The idea of blockchain as a sandbox for industries — from travel to IT to fintech — to build in is rapidly being adopted by some of the most established tech powerhouses. It’s time to stop thinking about how we can mold a blockchain to a certain use case, and instead think about how to build a blockchain to fit what we’re trying to build. This isn’t always simple, and it certainly isn’t easy to convince everyone of this view. To borrow a line from Steve Jobs, “a lot of times, people don’t know what they want until you show it to them.” It may not always work — using blockchain for your coffee maker startup is probably not wise — but it will help ambitious and creative founders to find meaningful reasons to use blockchain, the right way.

119::https://coinatory.com/cryptocurrency-news/paxos-to-launch-stablecoin-15029/::Coinatory::article::Paxos to Launch Dollar-Backed Stablecoin::Paxos, a cryptocurrency brokerage, has obtained preliminary regulatory approval in Singapore to offer digital payment token services, aiming to launch a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin upon receiving full approval. This move follows their initial license acquisition in Singapore for tokenization and custody services.::Paxos, a crypto brokerage, has secured a provisional license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore to provide digital payment token services, as stated in their recent announcement. This preliminary nod for the newly established Paxos Digital Singapore Pte. Ltd. enables the company to operate under the Payments Services Act (PSA) while it awaits full regulatory approval. Once fully authorized, Paxos plans to collaborate with corporate clients to launch a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin. Walter Hessert, Paxos’ Head of Strategy, highlighted the growing global demand for the U.S. dollar, noting the challenges non-U.S. consumers face in accessing dollars in a safe, reliable, and regulated manner. The firm anticipates that this new offering will attract more customers, especially with the stablecoin market projected to expand from $125 billion to $2.8 trillion over the next five years, according to estimates from brokerage firm Bernstein. This development marks a significant step for Paxos in Singapore, coming a year after the company first obtained a license to provide tokenization, custody, and trading services under the same legislation. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

120::https://cryptobriefing.com/binance-address-poisoning-detection-algorithm/::Crypto Briefing::article::Binance develops algorithm to combat address poisoning scams::The algorithm identifies spoofed addresses by detecting suspicious transfers, such as those with near-zero value or unknown tokens.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Blockchain security researchers from Binance have developed an algorithm that could detect poisoned crypto addresses on both the BNB Smart Chain and Ethereum networks. Address poisoning is a type of scamming method in the crypto space where threat actors send small amounts of crypto from and address that resembles a victim’s address. The purpose of such an attach is to mislead the targeted user to mistakenly use this fake address for transactions, resulting in funds being sent to a scammer instead of the intended recipient. This attack preys on users’ carelessness, as they may overlook subtle differences in addresses. A recent incident of address poisoning led to the loss of $71 million worth of Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC), alarming the crypto industry on the prevalence and scale of damage that such methods could incur. Fortunately, the thief returned the funds on May 13, likely due to the public attention and investigations into their potential Hong Kong-based IP addresses. Binance’s algorithm identifies spoofed addresses by detecting suspicious transfers, such as those with near-zero value or unknown tokens, pairing them with potential victim addresses, and timestamping malicious transactions to pinpoint the potential point of poisoning. The spoofed addresses are then registered in the database of Web3 security firm HashDit, Binance’s security partner, to help protect the wider crypto industry from these scams. Address poisoning scams can be difficult to detect, as most traders only verify the first and last digits of the wallet’s 42 alphanumeric characters, and most protocols only display these digits. Scammers also use vanity address generators to customize their addresses, making them appear less random or more similar to a given address.

121::https://theconversation.com/the-bitcoin-bubble-how-we-know-it-will-burst-88511::The Conversation::article::The Bitcoin bubble – how we know it will burst::An analysis of Bitcoin’s fundamentals shows how much of a bubble its price has inflated to.::In the last year, the price of Bitcoin has increased from less than US$800 to more than US$12,000. This huge spike in value has many asking if it is a bubble or if the high price today is here to stay. Finance defines a bubble as a situation where the price of an asset diverges systematically from its fundamentals. Investment mogul Jack Bogle says there is nothing to support Bitcoin, and the head of JP MorganChase, Jamie Dimon has called it a fraud “worse than tulip bulbs”. Like any asset, Bitcoin has some fundamental value, even if only a hope value, or a value arising from scarcity. So there are reasons to hold it. But our research does show that it is experiencing a bubble right now. Together with Shaen Corbet at Dublin City University, we took as the fundamentals of Bitcoin elements of the technology that underpins it (and other cryptocurrencies). We looked at measures, which represent the key theoretical and computational components of how cyrptocurrencies are priced. New Bitcoin is created by a process of mining units called blocks. Bitcoin is built on blockchain technology – a digital ledger of transactions – which enables the currency to be traded independently from any central banking system, without risk of fake or duplicate Bitcoins being used. Instead of having a bank verify pending transactions (a “block”), miners check them and, if approved, the block is cryptographically added to the ever-expanding ledger. So the first measure we examined relates to mining difficulty. It calculates how difficult it is to find a new block relative to the past. As per the Bitcoin Protocol, the number of Bitcoin is capped at 21m (there are currently 16.7m in circulation). This means that as more people mine for Bitcoin and more blocks are created, each block is, all things being equal, worth less than the previous block. The second measure we looked at relates to the “hash rate”. This is the speed at which a computer operates when mining. To successfully mine Bitcoin, you must come up with a 64-digit hexadecimal number (called a “hash”), which is less than or equal to the target hash. The faster you can do this, the better chance you have of finding the next block and receiving payment. The third measurement was “block size”. This relates to how large the chain is at any given time, with larger chains taking longer to mine than shorter ones. And lastly we looked at the volume of transactions conducted. Any asset, in particular any currency, which is more widely used will be more valuable than one which is used less frequently. In our study, we examined data from Bitcoin’s early days – from July 2010 to November 2017. The price of one Bitcoin did not rise above US$1 until April 16, 2011, then to US$10 on June 3, 2011 and US$100 on April 2, 2013. Since then the price rise has clearly been exceptional. We then applied an accepted method that is used to detect and date stamp bubbles after they burst. In essence, this involves identifying the existence of an explosive component in a series. As the series, here the price of bitcoin, “explodes”, it runs the risk, like any explosion, of flying apart. A possibly counter-intuitive result of this approach is that if a fundamental driver and the price of an asset both show an explosive component, we might not conclude a bubble is present. A bubble is when something deviates from its fundamental value. If the fundamental value is itself growing explosively then the price would also. Think of dividends on a stock. If, somehow, these were to grow at an explosive rate we might expect to see the price do the same. While unsustainable, this is not technically a bubble. To overcome this, we then date stamp a bubble as being present when the price shows an explosive component and the underlying fundamentals do not. Here are the results of the analysis: The orange lines denote when the price is showing explosive behaviour. We also see a period where the hash rate was growing explosively – the blue columns in late 2013 and early 2014. This is also an indication of a price bubble, which went on to burst. So there are clear points where bubbles are visible – including now. The price of Bitcoin at present shows explosive behaviour in the absence of anything similar in its fundamentals. We see the price moving upwards in a manner that is not related to the technical underpinnings. It is a clear bubble. A weakness of these tests and indeed all bubble identification tests is that they take place after the bubble has burst. Even this test, which can be redone as swiftly as new data arrives, is such. Bubbles by their nature grow in a compound manner – so even a day or two delay in addressing the situation can make a bubble significantly worse. What is not yet available is an accurate advanced warning bubble indicator. In its absence, this approach may be the best. Unfortunately, we cannot use this approach to determine the extent of the bubble. There is no well-accepted model that suggests a “fair” value for Bitcoin. But whatever that level is, it is almost certain that, at present, it is well below where we are now.::2017-12-06T13:51:08Z::Bitcoin, Blockchain, Commodities, Cryptocurrency, Finance, Financial bubbles, Money, financial assets::Brian Lucey::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/197931/original/file-20171206-933-mrs2fs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C440%2C3000%2C1500&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

April 9: Silicon Valley venture giant Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) made news last year when it announced plans to wade into deep tech research – switching off its investor cap to become a part-time computer science researcher and builder. On Tuesday, the firm unveiled some of the first fruits of that foray with the release of an open-source code implementation for "Jolt," its zero-knowledge virtual machine (zkVM). The "zero-knowledge" (ZK) bit of Jolt refers to a form of cryptographic trickery that powers a16z's VM under the hood – allowing the virtual computer to process and verify data while adhering to special constraints around privacy and security. April 9: Waterfall Network, a smart-contracts protocol based on directed acyclic graphs (DAG) technology, announced on Tuesday the release of a new desktop app for Windows and macOS that "allows almost anyone to easily set up their own node on the blockchain," according to the team: "With one-click setup, users only need to download and open the app, their Metamask (or any EVM) wallet, and they will have a full node running in sync with Waterfall Network.

April 9: POKT Network, describing itself as the "RPC base layer," has "welcomed three new gateways" and is bringing "open data access to millions of end users," according to the team. "Developer DAO, Raid Guild and Chainstack will bring their respective networks and distribution to POKT Network, providing more developers with read/write access to 60+ blockchains’ by building on top of POKT Network’s decentralized infrastructure. The innovation of Gateways lies in the ability for businesses of every kind – centralized or decentralized – to resell access to infrastructure by leveraging a blockchain protocol as the central coordinating party." April 9: Mantle, an Ethereum layer-2 network, has launched its Mantle Scouts Program, "to kickstart the growth of innovative projects on Mantle," according to the team: "Distributing $1 million worth of MNT tokens to select builder teams, the pilot edition of Mantle Scouts Program empowers 16 respected industry leaders to bootstrap credibility, growth and unique innovations. This includes David Chreng-Messembourg, founding partner of LeadBlock Partners and LeadBlock Bitpanda Ventures; Peter Yang, managing director at Fenbushi Capital; Tascha Punyaneramitdee, founder of INIT Capital; Chris Sirise, co-founder of Pixelmon; John Park, CEO of a41, among others." April 9: The Worldcoin project announced two new updates "to provide individuals more choice and control over their data," according to the team. They include "the ability to unverify World IDs via permanent iris code deletion and in-person age verification checks at each humanness verification location. These were established in consultation with third-party data, privacy and security experts including the Bavarian State Ofﬁce for Data Protection Supervision (BayLDA), the project’s lead supervisory authority in the EU." (WLD) April 9: Komodo, a project for blockchain interoperability and atomic swap technology, launched Komodo Wallet (browser extension), "a non-custodial crypto wallet, cross-chain DEX and crypto bridge all rolled into one app," according to the team. "From the Wallet tab, browser extension users can expand to a full-screen web interface to use additional features, including a fiat on-ramp, an NFT wallet (which supports ERC1155 and ERC721 tokens) and a crypto bridge. Komodo Wallet (browser extension) allows users to create a new wallet or import an existing Komodo Wallet seed phrase. If wishing to import crypto assets from a third-party wallet, users can do so by importing the associated private key(s). For users wishing to connect a third-party wallet, Trezor is supported within the app." April 9: Monad Labs, the development firm behind layer-1 blockchain Monad, has closed a $225 million Series A led by Paradigm with additional funding by investors including Electric Capital and Greenoaks. According to the team: "Founded in 2022 by Jump Trading alums Keone Hon and James Hunsaker, along with Eunice Giarta (former MIT Media Lab, Shutterstock, Broadway Technology), Monad raised its $19 million seed round in February 2023." The layer-1 blockchain is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that executes the rules of Ethereum and makes sure submitted transactions and smart contracts follow the rules. More than 96% of the capital invested in decentralized finance (DeFi) is processed by the EVM, Monad said in a post on Substack. However, while Ethereum processes fewer than 20 transactions per second, according to etherscan.io, Monad says its testnet, which went live in March, can handle some 10,000 TPS. April 9: The DFINITY Foundation, a Swiss not-for-profit research and development organization and major contributor to the Internet Computer blockchain, announced the launch of the Olympus Acceleration Platform, describing it as "Web3’s first decentralized, on-chain global acceleration platform. Olympus supports the development and adoption of Web3 technology across multiple ecosystems. The acceleration platform is a first of its kind platform and will be used by teams around the world to organize and launch their own accelerator programs." April 9: ZkLink announced the consolidation of stablecoins on zkLink Nova, an aggregated layer-3 ZK rollup network with EVM compatibility. According to the team: "Upon execution, assets of the same value across supported L2 chains will be transacted as a single token on Nova. This achievement marks the next milestone in zkLink’s mission to resolve the liquidity fragmentation issue across L2 networks." According to a press release: "Currently, Nova has achieved asset aggregation, allowing users to deposit native assets from various L2 networks onto Nova for cross-chain asset trading. However, having the same assets from these networks shown as different tokens on Nova (i.e. USDC.arbi, USDC.Linea, etc.) can hinder users' trading experience. As such, Nova has deployed "MergeToken" smart contracts to consolidate assets of the same value from different chains on Nova into a single token (e.g. USDC.arbi, USDC.Linea merge into USDC). The first tokens to merge are stablecoins USDC, USDT, DAI; followed by wBTC and other tokens upon projects' requests. The token merge process will be managed by a prestigious governance committee of 12 prominent projects and institutions including Wintermute, Particle Network, Skynet Trading, Flowtraders, Ascensive Assets, Republic Crypto, Efficient Frontier, SIG, USDV, Layer Bank, Redstone Oracles and Manta Network. This committee will review and approve or deny the proposals to merge additional tokens into Nova's L3 infrastructure – decentralizing decision making and preventing autonomous control." April 9: XYO, an open-source platform for aggregating, verifying and organizing decentralized data from hardware nodes, is introducing "xyOS, an innovative platform set to enhance XYO's node functionality with a user-friendly interface that democratizes access to its platform, protocol, and network," according to the team: "Users can enjoy blockchain perks and a more sovereign experience, free from centralized constraints. Explore, create, exchange, and connect confidently on xyOS, where your engagements are truly your own. COIN users and XYO community members can sign up for early access slated for this April here." April 9: 0G Labs unveiled the launch of the testnet for 0G, designed to be a modular ultra-high data throughput blockchain optimized for on-chain AI, according to the team. "The network is now available for node operators, developers and the community to join and provide feedback for an upcoming mainnet launch in Q3 2024. The modular architecture enables 0G to offer a lean and performant network, unencumbered by legacy consensus algorithms, unrelated use cases sharing the same block space, as well as on-demand scaling."

If you own or intend to buy Polkadot (DOT), you must find an appropriate Polkadot wallet to store your assets. This guide looks at the top Polkadot wallets that combine security, usability, and robust features to improve your crypto experience in 2024. Ledger is a type of hardware wallet designed to provide high-level security for storing and managing digital assets. These devices store user’s private keys in a secure hardware device, making it very difficult for hackers to access the keys even if a user’s computer is compromised. Ledger wallets are designed with security at the forefront and have received certifications for their security standards. These cold wallets also support staking and connect seamlessly with Ledger Live, an app that facilitates seamless asset management. • Secure chip technology: Ledger wallets utilize secure chip technology to safeguard your private keys and device PIN. This technology is similar to that used in credit cards and passports, providing tamper-resistant protection of your assets. • Multi-currency support: Ledger wallets support a wide variety of cryptocurrencies and digital assets, allowing users to manage multiple assets on a single device. This includes popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many others, as well as a range of altcoins and tokens. • Integration with Ledger Live: The Ledger Live software allows users to manage their cryptocurrencies from their computer or mobile device, offering an intuitive interface for checking balances, sending and receiving funds, and staking cryptocurrencies directly from the software. • Backup and restoration: Each Ledger wallet comes with a recovery phrase setup, which is used to recover your assets in case the device is lost or damaged. This phrase needs to be stored securely as it provides access to your funds. SafePal is a cryptocurrency hardware wallet supported by Binance Labs, the venture arm of the Binance cryptocurrency exchange. SafePal offers a secure and user-friendly way to store, manage, and trade various cryptocurrencies without exposing your private keys to potential online threats. Designed to be both accessible and functional, SafePal provides several key features that appeal to a broad range of crypto users, from beginners to experienced traders. • Self-destruct mechanism: SafePal wallets are designed with a self-destruct mechanism that wipes the device if malicious attempts to open or hack the device are detected. This ensures protection against physical tampering. • Mobile application: SafePal offers a mobile app that integrates seamlessly with its hardware wallet, facilitating easy management of assets on the go. The app includes features like trading, swapping, and tracking market trends. • Secure element: The SafePal S1 hardware wallet is equipped with a secure element chip that stores private keys in a highly secure environment, protecting them from both physical and electronic attacks. • Air-gapped security: SafePal utilizes QR code technology for data transmission, which eliminates the need for a wired or Bluetooth connection. This air-gapped feature significantly enhances security by minimizing the attack vectors. Polkawallet is designed to interact with the Substrate framework, which underpins the Polkadot network. Substrate is a blockchain-building framework developed by Parity Technologies, which is also used to develop Polkadot and its parachains. The mobile wallet specifically aims to provide users with a convenient and secure way to manage their DOT and interact with the Polkadot network. • Cross-chain message passing (XCMP): Polkawallet supports XCMP, enabling transactions and interactions between various parachains directly from the mobile wallet. • Governance participation: The wallet alerts users to new referendums or proposals, offering an intuitive and convenient way to view details and participate in governance. • Staking: Polkawallet provides a user-friendly dashboard designed for both validators and nominators, simplifying the process of contributing to the network’s security and governance. • Offline signature: Utilized as an observation wallet, Polkawallet remains connected to the internet for functionality without storing private keys, enhancing security. Enkrypt wallet is a browser extension wallet developed by MyEtherWallet (MEW). It’s designed to be compatible with both EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and Substrate-based blockchains. This compatibility allows users to interact seamlessly with Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains, as well as with Substrate-based chains like Polkadot, Kusama, Acala, and others. • Manage tokens and NFTs: Allows for the storage and management of various digital assets, including tokens and NFTs. • Token swaps and asset bridging: Facilitates the swapping of tokens and bridging of assets between different blockchain networks. • Purchase crypto with bank card Enables users to buy cryptocurrencies directly using their bank cards. • Manage multiple accounts: Supports the management of multiple accounts across different networks from a single interface. • Connect to web3 applications: Provides seamless integration with Web3 apps, allowing users to interact with decentralized applications easily. SubWallet is a browser extension wallet designed specifically for the Substrate and Polkadot ecosystems, offering a range of functionalities tailored to these networks. It provides an interface for users to manage their digital assets, interact with decentralized applications (DApps), and participate in the network activities of Substrate-based and Polkadot-related blockchains. • Support for multiple networks: SubWallet is compatible with various Substrate-based chains including, Polkadot, Kusama, and other parachains, facilitating easy switches between these networks within the wallet. • Asset management: Users can manage, send, and receive multiple types of assets, including tokens and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) across supported networks. • Staking and governance: Offers tools for staking and participating in the governance processes of Polkadot and other Substrate-based networks, allowing users to stake their tokens directly from the wallet and vote on proposals and referenda. • DApp interaction: Integrates seamlessly with various DApps on the Substrate ecosystem, enabling users to interact with these applications directly through the wallet. Here’s a quick comparison chart outlining the key features of the listed Polkadot wallets, as well as the respective security levels, user interface ratings, and staking capabilities of each. DOT is the native coin of the Polkadot blockchain. Gavin Wood, best known for co-founding Ethereum, created the network. Polkadot is a layer-0 protocol, meaning it is the foundational layer for an ecosystem of blockchains. Substrate-based chains are designed to connect with Polkadot. Some of these include Moonbeam and Acala. In mid-May 2024, Polkadot’s market cap was just over $9 billion. Users can stake or delegate (nominate) DOT to earn rewards for securing the platform. The minimum DOT required to become a nominator may change over time; however, the current minimum in 2024 is 554.256 DOT. When choosing a wallet, consider the following key aspects: When choosing a wallet, a few features stand out as must-haves. Whether you choose a software, hardware, or mobile wallet, make sure it supports DOT staking, has strong security measures, and is easy to use. Hardware wallets for DOT provide cold storage solutions, making them less vulnerable to online threats. Look for options that support multiple cryptocurrencies and have a proven track record of security. Software wallets offer convenience, while mobile wallets for DOT add the benefit of managing your assets on the go. These are typically hot wallets, which are connected to the internet. For optimal security, consider non-custodial wallets that give you full control over your private keys. For those interested in earning rewards through staking, choosing a wallet that supports Polkadot staking is essential. These wallets should offer a straightforward process for staking and un-staking DOT, along with clear information on staking rewards and timeframes. Self-custodial wallets, also known as non-custodial wallets, allow you full control over your crypto assets. There are no intermediaries between you and your DOT, significantly reducing the risk of third-party mishaps. JP Richardson, CEO of Exodus, emphasized the importance of self-custodial wallets in a discussion about the origins of his company. Richardson recalled the precarious nature of cryptocurrency exchanges back in 2015, a time when many such platforms were collapsing. We started Exodus back in 2015, and the reason we started Exodus was we were looking at all of the exchanges that had collapsed… At that moment in time, in 2015, if you wanted to have a diverse portfolio of crypto assets, the only place that you could actually do that was an exchange. This observation underscores the need for self-custodial solutions that provide secure and diversified asset management away from the vulnerabilities associated with exchanges. Furthermore, these wallets facilitate direct engagement with the Polkadot blockchain, crucial for activities like staking and governance. Additionally, self-custodial wallets enhance privacy since your financial activities are decentralized and not monitored by a central authority. This setup aligns with the fundamental ethos of blockchain technology — promoting autonomy and security. By choosing a self-custodial wallet, you are also less likely to be impacted by the regulatory or operational changes that can impact custodial wallet providers, ensuring more consistent access to your funds. Remember the risks of custodial exchanges and wallets. As 2014 Bitcoiners know, Mt Gox funds are still tied up in bankruptcy court. https://t.co/eLzZW3hJz5 Creating a Polkadot wallet involves a few simple steps. Here’s what it looks like with Enkrypt. 1. Choose your wallet type: Decide between hardware, software, or mobile based on your needs. 2. Download/Install the wallet: Visit the official website or app store to download your chosen wallet. Ensure you are accessing a secure and official source. 3. Create and backup your wallet: Create and securely store your backup phrases in multiple locations. This is crucial for recovery in case of device loss or failure. 4. Transfer DOT to your wallet: After setting up, transfer DOT from an exchange or another wallet to your new Polkadot wallet. Choosing the right Polkadot wallet requires a balance of security, convenience, and functionality. As the Polkadot ecosystem grows and the crypto market evolves, having a reliable and secure DOT wallet will ensure you are well-positioned to take advantage of all Polkadot offers. Remember, the ultimate goal is to protect your digital assets while making the most of the innovative features of the Polkadot blockchain. Always prioritize crypto wallet security, and ensure you only ever click official links. The best Polkadot wallet depends on your personal needs. It is generally advised to use hardware wallets like Ledger or SafePal to store your cryptocurrency. This is because hardware wallets take extra precautions to safely manage your private keys. You can store Polkadot coins on any compatible wallet. Some of the popular wallets include Polkawallet, Subwallet, and Enkrypt. You can also store Polkadot in hardware wallets like Ledger or SafePal. You can get a Polkadot wallet by going to the official Polkadot website and searching for wallets. There are many wallets that accept Polkadot and Substrate blockchains. However, only a few offer ecosystem specific features like staking or voting. It is important to only use wallets that have a proven track record of safety. Non-custodial and open-source wallets are a preferred method of crypto storage. Keep in mind that poor operational security can mitigate any safety measures provided by safe wallets. A Polkadot wallet is secure if it is non-custodial, has secure random number generation, and properly stores private keys. Wallet users can recognize good wallets by searching for reviews and looking for audits. Additionally, it is advised to use open source wallets, where the community can assess the safety themselves. Users can choose the best wallet for staking DOT by first choosing a wallet that offers staking. Thereafter, you choose the wallet by security features, such as non-custodial biometric verification, address whitelisting, pin codes, and other security features. Beyond this, you can choose a wallet that fits your specific needs and wants. Substrate compatible wallets allow you to store Polkadot and equivalent chains. This includes Kusama, Acala, Moonbeam, and others. Some wallets also allow you to hold non-Substrate cryptocurrencies, but they may not offer the staking and governance features.

124::https://blockworks.co/news/fox-authenticate-digital-media-sources::Blockworks::article::FOX Corp hopes to authenticate digital media with blockchain tech::The media conglomerate’s blockchain entity is letting news organizations prove ownership over their content.::The media conglomerate’s blockchain arm is letting news organizations prove ownership over their content rafapress/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks FOX Corporation has announced the launch of ‘Verify,’ an innovative open-source protocol developed with Polygon PoS. This new tool is designed to establish the authenticity and origin of digital content. The initiative responds to the increasing challenges presented by artificial intelligence-generated media, seeking to provide a reliable verification system across the digital landscape. An Axios report said FOX plans to use the tool to make licensing more straightforward for the training of generative AI tools trained on large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. Verify came out of FOX’s Blockchain Creative Labs, which is incorporated under the FOX-owned streaming service Tubi. Blockchain Creative Labs formerly tinkered with NFT integrations in the FOX ecosystem before this latest venture into AI applications. In a blog post accompanying the release, Tubi CEO Paul Cheesbrough said Verify was “somewhat inspired by” the AI optimism of a16z head Marc Andreessen, who wrote favorably about the potential for cryptographic signatures to prevent malicious AI content. Cheesbrough also said Verify could create a repository to iron out licensing wrinkles between news outlets and AI developers who train models using media content. Notably, The New York Times alleged copyright infringement from OpenAI in a late December lawsuit. The Times claimed that millions of its articles were used to train OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot without compensation. Verify uses digital signatures to allow publishers to put media on-chain, making it easier for everyone to trace the original source of the content. News organizations can upload articles, for instance, which are turned into NFTs through Ethereum’s ERC-6150 standard. ERC-6150s are “hierarchical” NFTs that are useful for putting things like social media on-chain. With Verify, the public can use the unique token ID of these NFTs to find out the original source of any given piece of content recorded to the protocol. This is particularly useful in a world where AI and other technologies can easily copy and disseminate information without readily apparent citation. For now, the Verify Tool’s beta interface only supports FOX-owned outlets. The company has minted over 80,000 pieces of content, Axios reported. Axios said FOX is in talks with other media outlets to begin using the tool. A source with knowledge of the matter said Verify’s code was made open source in hopes that developers would build other applications on top of the protocol. Whether or not Verify can gain meaningful adoption outside of the FOX ecosystem, it may indicate a place for blockchain in AI development. “Following generative AI’s meteoric rise in 2023, we’re going to see a more transparency-focused approach to the technology this year,” Niraj Pant, founder of crypto-adjacent AI startup Ritual, said in a direct message. Verify is built on Polygon, a decision Cheesbrough says was made because of the chain’s scaling prowess. FOX’s Verify represents the first attempt by a major media company to use blockchain for AI development. Illia Polosukhin, co-founder of NEAR Protocol, thinks potential adoption of the tool by news organizations could prove blockchain technology’s bona fides to a wider audience. “I think the biggest benefit we can see is removing some stigma from mass media around crypto,” Polosukhin said.

125::https://coinatory.com/cryptocurrency-news/ripples-ceo-criticizes-u-s-14876/::Coinatory::article::Ripple's CEO Criticizes U.S. Crypto Regulations::Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, recently voiced strong criticism against the U.S. regulatory::In a series of recent comments, Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, expressed strong disapproval of the U.S. regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, particularly criticizing SEC Chair Gary Gensler. This tension could spell trouble for investors in Ripple’s cryptocurrency, XRP. Let’s delve into Garlinghouse’s remarks and explore the latest forecasts for XRP’s value. Brad Garlinghouse was forthright in his critique of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its leader, Gary Gensler. Speaking at DC Fintech Week, he accused the SEC and Gensler of misdirecting their efforts by pursuing legal action against Ripple and engaging with figures like Sam Bankman-Fried. Garlinghouse suggested that this focus might have contributed to overlooking fraud within the broader cryptocurrency market. He also targeted the SEC over speculation that they were in talks with Grayscale about the possibility of converting the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Garlinghouse contrasted the U.S. regulatory approach with that of other countries that are more actively engaging with the crypto industry, implying that the SEC’s current strategy under Gensler’s leadership is politically detrimental. In another interview, Garlinghouse expressed frustration with the U.S. government’s unclear position on cryptocurrencies. Although Ripple has recently achieved a partial legal victory over the SEC, Garlinghouse emphasized that American banks are still reluctant to incorporate XRP, owing to the persistent regulatory uncertainties. He noted that despite the court win, the U.S. government’s stance towards cryptocurrencies remains unwelcoming. Garlinghouse specifically mentioned the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) as being opposed to cryptocurrencies, suggesting that significant involvement from U.S. banks is unlikely until there’s a shift in this attitude. Despite these criticisms and the unclear regulatory landscape, Ripple has seen some positive developments. The company has received constructive feedback from the SEC and payment processing companies. They’ve also proposed a plan to Judge Torres, seeking a 90-day period to arrange for a scheduling entry. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

126::https://cryptobriefing.com/bvnk-paypal-pyusd-integration/::Crypto Briefing::article::PayPal's stablecoin PYUSD joins BVNK's crypto payment ecosystem::The integration aims to streamline global business payments.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article BVNK, a payment infrastructure provider, has announced the integration of the PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin, issued by Paxos Trust Company, into its payment system. This move allows businesses to access PYUSD on BVNK’s platform, which supports a variety of digital and fiat currencies. In addition, as an approved member of the PYUSD ecosystem, BVNK can directly create (mint) and remove (burn) PYUSD tokens for customers, the company shared in the press release. Chris Harmse, BVNK co-founder and VP of Commercial Strategy, stated: “We’re building modern payment infrastructure to enable more businesses to operate across banks and blockchains and maximize financial flexibility. Stablecoins make up almost 90% of the payment we process, and they’re very important to our customers as a way to settle global payment efficiently. We’re thrilled to introduce PYUSD to our platform,” Harmse stated. Nick Robnett, Head of Asset Growth at Paxos, also commented on the integration, highlighting the trust and growth PYUSD brings to digital assets. “As a dollar-pegged stablecoin that is issued by Paxos Trust Company, which is overseen by New York Department of Financial Services, PYUSD is bringing greater trust to digital assets. We’re seeing growth every day as it’s rolled out across the PayPal ecosystem – and we’re delighted to team up with BVNK to give more businesses access to PYUSD, and more options for how they move their money globally,” Robnett noted. With PYUSD, BVNK customers can engage in a range of financial activities, including settling payments and creating PYUSD wallets. The integration reflects the significant role stablecoins play in the blockchain economy. As of May 16, 2024, PYUSD’s market cap reached $377 million, according to data from CoinGecko.

127::https://theconversation.com/bitcoin-isnt-a-currency-and-unless-it-becomes-one-it-could-be-worthless-88656::The Conversation::article::Bitcoin isn’t a currency – and unless it becomes one it could be worthless::If you can’t use Bitcoin to buy anything then it has no intrinsic value.::Bitcoin is in decline. Not its price, which has increased 900% this year and (at the time of writing) stands at over US$12,000 per unit, but its actual use as a currency. And this makes its rapid appreciation all the more puzzling. A few years ago, enthusiasts triumphantly shared announcements from businesses that had started accepting Bitcoin. Over the last couple of years, such announcements have become scarce. Instead, businesses that once accepted the currency have begun to drop it. The BBC contacted ten businesses in London that once advertised accepting Bitcoin. Four no longer accepted it, and two that did said they hardly ever received payments in Bitcoin. The same is even true online. The Wall Street Journal, citing a report by Morgan Stanley, recently reported that Bitcoin is now accepted by just three of the top 500 global online merchants, down from five last year. If growing adoption as a currency can’t justify Bitcoin’s rapid appreciation, what can? Many enthusiasts have started to promote the idea of Bitcoin as a store of value. In economics, this is usually defined along the lines of “an item that people can use to transfer purchasing power from the present to the future”. In simple terms, it’s somewhere safe to invest your wealth that won’t lose its worth over time. Apples can be used to barter services from a neighbour while they’re still fresh, but their purchasing power will disappear as they rot. The purchasing power can be retained into the future by exchanging the apples for money, gold, government bonds or some other store of value. Some items have attributes that make them better stores of value than others, whether we are talking about physical items or digital objects. Gold is a good store of value because it’s durable. Electronic bond certificates are also durable as long as banks’ systems don’t fail, and have the added benefit of being easier to secure than physical valuables. Money, both physical currency and digital bank money, has the advantage of being very liquid, so it’s easy to convert into a purchase when needed. Bitcoin does share many of these attributes of a good store of value. It also offers potentially high levels of financial privacy, somewhat similarly to the offshore banking system. This is an important attribute of a store of value for some people, although it also creates a lack of accountability and the potential for tax evasion. But the most important attribute of a store of value is that it’s valuable. Gold is valuable because it has many industrial and decorative uses. Its price can fluctuate because of speculation on financial markets, but it can never fall to zero. There will always be someone willing to accept gold because it’s a useful commodity. Similarly, US government bonds are ultimately valuable because they entitle the owner to a relatively secure flow of interest payments. Dollars and euros are valuable because they are widely accepted as a means of payment, and will continue to be so in the foreseeable future. In contrast, the future acceptability of the Venezuelan bolivar is in doubt, so people are desperately trying to exchange it to better stores of value. Is Bitcoin valuable? It has no industrial or decorative uses, and it doesn’t entitle the holder to receive interest. It was intended to be valuable as a currency that is accepted the world over, but that doesn’t seem to be happening. The only major value that Bitcoin has now is its exchange value. Many people are willing to pay a lot of money today to get hold of some Bitcoin. But what they are getting for their money is simply the hope that another buyer down the line will pay even more money for the coins. Once the music stops, there is no fundamental value to prevent the coins’ price from falling close to zero, save for their tenuous position as the currency of choice in the online drug trade and grey-area gambling. The idea that Bitcoin is valuable because it’s a store of value is upside down. In reality, something becomes a store of value because it’s valuable. In the 1990s, people started to trade Beanie Babies on eBay. Prices of these limited-edition plush toys rose to thousands of dollars, and by 1997 they made up 6.6% of the entire site’s transaction volume. Some people invested their life savings into Beanie Babies, fully expecting their value to be preserved and more. But eventually people came to their senses and the market bombed. Beanie Babies are useful as toys and collectables, but that doesn’t justify thousand-dollar valuations. My advice to individuals and institutions tempted by the headlines is to keep their savings away from Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and “initial coin offerings” (ICOs). I know serious blockchain developers won’t mind me saying this, because they see speculative bubbles and bursts as a distraction. For Bitcoin to truly function as a store of value, it first has to gain acceptance as a currency.::2017-12-06T11:22:50Z::Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, Currency, Financial bubbles, MIT Press::Vili Lehdonvirta::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/197837/original/file-20171205-22967-13ldzf4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
128::https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/04/04/ripple-developer-behind-xrp-ledger-enters-stablecoin-fray-vs-tether-usdc/::CoinDesk::article::Ripple, Developer Behind XRP Ledger, Enters Stablecoin Fray vs. Tether, USDC::The token will be "100% backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S. government Treasuries and other cash equivalents," according to the company.::Ripple, the enterprise-focused blockchain service and creator of the XRP Ledger, is introducing its own stablecoin pegged to the price of the U.S. dollar. "The stablecoin market is over $150 billion today and is forecasted to exceed $2.8 trillion by 2028," Ripple said in a statement shared with CoinDesk. "There’s clear demand for stablecoins that deliver trust, stability and utility." The company said the token, which it plans to release "later this year," will be "100% backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S. government Treasuries and other cash equivalents." The stablecoin will be deployed onto Ripple's institution-focused XRP Ledger along with the Ethereum blockchain to start out, and it will be based on Ethereum's ERC-20 token standard. Ripple's announcement comes as stablecoins have proven one of the most popular types of digital assets among crypto traders, free (in theory) from the price volatility witnessed in larger cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum's ether (ETH). Read more: What is a Stablecoin? "What we think is going to be our differentiator is going to be the fact that the assets are going to be in dollars, Treasuries – rock solid," Ripple CTO David Schwartz told CoinDesk in an interview. "We're not trying to juice the last couple of decimal points out of this. We're looking to conquer the market and be in it for the long term." As for why Ripple – still battling an enforcement case brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission – has decided to jump into the stablecoin game, Schwartz said that the decision, in part, came down to simple "dollars and cents." "Part of it is just opportunistic. It's a growing market," he said. "You could be a bank that pays no interest. That seems like a pretty good business opportunity." Schwartz said the new stablecoin could also help breathe some life into the XRP Ledger's decentralized finance ecosystem, which has a decentralized exchange but relatively low usage relative to other chains. According to Schwartz, transparency – historically a key point of scrutiny for stablecoin issuers – will be a key focus for Ripple as it rolls out its new token. "We're gonna have public audits on a monthly basis, hopefully by a top-tier accounting firm and will disclose more on that later," said Schwartz. "We're aiming for complete transparency. You know, we'll do whatever we need to do to address those issues." Beyond the promise of transparency, Schwartz emphasized that the potential growth of the stablecoin market – currently dominated by Tether's USDT token and Circle's USDC – serves as a disincentive for Ripple or any other stablecoin provider to act dishonestly. Coinbase, the publicly traded U.S. crypto exchange, is an investor in Circle. "In the early days of Tether, people were expecting it to blow up any day, and they felt like it was really sketchy," said Schwartz. But now, "if you're Tether, it wouldn't make sense for you to run off with people's money," said Schwartz. "Even if that was your plan, you'd wait to do it" because "the market is only growing." In Ripple's case, "we're not trying to squeeze a couple of extra pennies out – we don't need to," said Schwartz. "Our balance sheet is rock solid." The Ripple CTO said his token will be aimed primarily at enterprise customers and banking institutions, organizations for whom "those kinds of practical arguments aren't really prescient because they have to justify their decisions" to "stockholders and to regulators and so on." To satisfy the needs of this market segment, Ripple says it is using U.S. banks to hold its reserves and is taking what it terms a "compliance-first mindset." USDC is currently the market leader among compliance-oriented stablecoin consumers, but Schwartz said he doesn't see it as "a winner takes all" environment. "If we were a solid number three and the market grows 12x, that's not a failure scenario," said Schwartz. "Obviously we would like to do better than that, but that's not a failure case, that's still pretty gosh darn good." Edited by Bradley Keoun.

This ensures fair compensation when accepting a new job offer and helps set expectations for your skills and contributions. This guide offers strategies for negotiating salary expectations, ensuring you secure a compensation package that reflects your true value. These tactics will help prepare you to navigate salary discussions with confidence. Discussing your salary is pivotal, especially when transitioning into new fields like web3 jobs or moving from non-tech jobs to tech roles. These discussions also promote workplace transparency, especially in web3, where standard compensation packages are still being developed. Importantly, clear salary discussions aid in personal financial planning, which may benefit people who are transitioning careers. This issue of fair compensation also intertwines with the gender pay gap, often due to different negotiation tactics between genders. A study by the Pew Research Center indicates that most U.S. workers, except those self-employed, did not negotiate for higher pay than their last job initially offered. Nevertheless, men are slightly more likely than women to have asked for higher pay, with 32% of men versus 28% of women reporting they negotiated for more than the offer. This disparity highlights the importance of encouraging proactive salary discussions across all sectors to reduce discrepancies and ensure a more equal working environment. Securing the salary you deserve requires a well-prepared approach to negotiation. Here are a few steps to get you started: Before you even start negotiating, it’s essential to have a clear understanding of what your skills are worth in the current market. This involves researching salary ranges for web3 jobs and similar positions within your geographic area and industry. Websites like Glassdoor, PayScale, and LinkedIn Salary can provide insights into what others in your field earn. Next, a thorough self-assessment is equally important. List your skills, experiences, and accomplishments, especially those rare and in high demand. This will help you understand your market worth and enable you to articulate these during negotiations. Once you have a clear picture of the market and your worth, set a realistic salary target based on this data. Setting a range rather than a single figure is often useful, giving you flexibility and room to negotiate. When negotiating salaries, especially in web3, tailor your pitch to highlight how your unique skills and experiences align with the company’s needs and goals. Be prepared to discuss specific examples of how your contributions could benefit the organization, perhaps by mentioning similar accomplishments or demonstrating an understanding of new technologies and trends in web3. Using concrete data to demonstrate your value can be highly persuasive. For instance, if you’ve led projects that exceeded goals or significantly improved efficiencies, quantify these achievements in terms of time, money saved, or revenue generated. “When negotiating, highlight your skills and how they align with the role, and be clear about which parts of the package you are discussing, including salary, benefits, and work flexibility. Always aim for a mutually beneficial agreement and keep the door open for future discussions as you demonstrate your value.” Timing can significantly impact the outcome of your salary negotiation. Ideally, discussions about salary should come after you’ve received a job offer but before you accept it. This is when you have the most leverage, as the company has already indicated they want you but hasn’t locked down the terms of your employment. When discussing salary, avoid admitting to being underpaid. Instead, convey that you're highly sought after. Frame it so that compensation seems secondary, showcasing your market desirability. Regardless of how negotiations unfold, maintaining a professional demeanor is crucial. This not only helps preserve your current relationships within the company but also sets a positive tone that could benefit your future interactions. It’s often advantageous to ask for a slightly higher salary than your target. This gives you some room to maneuver during negotiations and can result in a higher final offer than initially anticipated. Remember, salary is just one part of your compensation package. Benefits such as health insurance, retirement contributions, flexible working conditions, and professional development opportunities can also be negotiated and add significant value to your package. Arina Kogalenok, HR Director at BeInCrypto, highlights the importance of taking an extra step in your career, be it in web3 or any tech role: “I had an employee who took the initiative to outline a set of tasks he would like to take on in addition to his current role and indicated the desired salary level for this work. This greatly facilitated my decision-making process regarding his promotion. I view this approach as highly professional and would be happy to discuss options with such an individual.” Be prepared for potential objections and have appropriate responses on standby. This might include justifications for your salary request based on your research or alternative compensation options if the employer cannot meet your salary expectations. If the salary offered is non-negotiable, consider other areas where you can agree on beneficial terms, such as a sign-on bonus, extra vacation time, or remote work days. Securing an appropriate salary requires preparation, strategic timing, and clear communication. Understanding and articulating your value can enhance your chances of securing a compensation package that reflects your worth, especially in the web3 sector. Negotiation is not just about pushing for more but about finding a mutually beneficial agreement that fosters long-term career fulfillment and growth. Researching industry standards for your role and assessing your experience and achievements can help you establish a realistic salary range. If your counteroffer significantly exceeds the initial offer, consider revising it and inquiring about future growth opportunities within the company. Negotiating rather than accepting the first offer outright is advisable, as initial offers often include some room for negotiation. Ultimately, it’s important to follow your intuition, and if you feel the need to do so, you can ask for advice from a close friend or colleague in the same industry. If the salary is fixed, you can still negotiate other aspects of your compensation, like benefits, work flexibility, or a signing bonus. However, the scope of negotiation may vary depending on the conversation’s context, so it’s crucial to gauge the discussion’s tone and flow. Even in conservative sectors, using a factual and data-driven approach to demonstrate your value can bolster your negotiation. Tailor your tactics to emphasize mutual benefits, rather than making bold demands.

130::https://blockworks.co/news/crypto-blockchain-not-synonymous::Blockworks::article::Crypto and blockchain are not synonymous::Opinion: In other words, one should not judge the merits of an entire technology based on how much BONK they lost.::In other words, one should not judge the merits of an entire technology based on how much BONK they lost Artwork by Crystal Le Crypto — like any speculative asset — experienced its fair share of volatility this year. After plummeting to lows of $16,000 following the collapse of FTX in November 2022, bitcoin surpassed $43,000 in December 2023 as part of a rally that some say is just beginning. But my hope is that crypto’s persistent reputation for volatility doesn’t tarnish the perceived value of blockchain’s underlying technology. As we go into 2024, I’m optimistic that the inherent capabilities of distributed ledger technology will extend beyond mere market action. Assessing blockchain’s worth solely through the lens of profit performance overlooks the broader utility and transformative potential of Web3. In other words, one should not judge the merits of an entire technology based on how much BONK they lost. In September, blockchain data company Chainalysis released its 2023 Global Adoption Index. The purpose of this report was to recognize “leaders of grassroots crypto adoption,” and to identify the countries where average, everyday people are putting the greatest share of their wealth into cryptocurrency. The results were promising. Of the 20 countries listed, many belong to emerging market economies transitioning from lower incomes and rates of development toward rapid expansion of trade and investment flows. Personally, I’d like to believe that the growing adoption of digital currencies reinforces the technology that underlies it. What’s all the hype about? You lean into it. You go from having a MetaMask wallet and visiting a Bitcoin ATM to reading a few articles and understanding the properties of blockchain that afford secure, public transactions of data and information. You learn about Satoshi’s motivations behind digital assets not as a way to make the rich richer, but to disrupt power-hungry institutions standing in the way of autonomy and democratic financial access. Yes, blockchain is typically associated with its range of financial use cases. But the decentralized, permissionless and non-sovereign technology has, at its core, a social and reformist potential. My hypothesis is that greater grassroots adoption and understanding of crypto assets generates room for uses that capitalize on blockchain to effect change beyond the strictly financial realm. In looking beyond bitcoin rallies and new exchange offerings, other dynamic applications of blockchain come to life. Chainalysis’ 2023 index signals the presence of audiences keen to engage and capture the broader social value that blockchain offers — highlighting Web3 projects that are exceeding blockchain’s financial boundaries to drive cultural and socioeconomic transformations around the world. Nigeria: Akowe, meaning “clerk” in Yoruba, is a one-man Lagos-based startup using blockchain to issue and verify academic records. Almost all certificates issued by Nigerian tertiary institutions are physical hard copies. Coupled with high unemployment rates, certificate forgeries have become increasingly commonplace. Employers and HR firms bear the brunt of high verification costs needed to ensure the credibility of academic records, resulting in verification processes taking anywhere between two weeks to six months. Akowe’s mission is to introduce digital certificates to educators and Nigerian learning institutions, using blockchain to facilitate a tamper-proof and easily verifiable system of digital academic records. While Akowe previously operated using permissioned blockchain Hyperledger, Agboola is now exploring Amazon’s new ledger database solution QLDB, which allows organizations to create centrally managed records. The startup has piloted its project with two institutions and is actively engaged in discussions with 15 other universities, indicating a growing interest in the blockchain-based verification solution to reduce complexities within the current education sector. India: Web3 middleware SaaS start-up Airchains is partnering with West Bengal’s New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) to digitize land ownership using NFTs. The presumption of land ownership in India is complicated by different jurisdictional processes. Conflicting title investigations and lost paperwork creates glaring inconsistencies in the maintenance of land records, impeding the Indian real estate market and often making land the subject of long and tedious litigation. Airchains uses blockchain to develop unique NFTs that serve as land ownership proofs under NKDA’s jurisdiction. This system allows property registration certificates and land records to be digitally recorded and traced, eliminating tedious paperwork and promising to facilitate the lifetime tracking of ownership. Physical copies of NFTs are available in card format, while digital QR code certificates are used to ensure quick access after relevant authentication processes. Digitizing proof of land records in this way is also crucial to counteract ownership often made on the basis of customary claims. Airchains’ agenda is testament to the blockchain revolution to “steadily penetrat[e] and disrupt a plethora of traditional sectors.” Crucially, the project remains uninvolved with crypto transactions, choosing easier, gasless methods to interact with users. Airchains’ user base has soared by 150% in the past two quarters, alluding to a widespread consensus about replacing traditional bureaucracy with a transparent and secure digital system of land ownership. The team plans to introduce 500,000 NFTs deployed on Polygon Supernets to expand the land mutation process across 27,000 acres, as reported by Forbes. These examples illustrate why blockchain and crypto cannot be conflated — and why people shouldn’t be quick to point to market volatility as a reason to dismiss both. Once you distinguish a technology from its dominant applications, its uses quickly multiply. Blockchain is a new frontier in the world of finance, sure. But it is irresponsible and inaccurate to correlate an asset’s volatility to its legitimacy, especially as bitcoin’s price now exceeds $40,000 and promises to continue being influenced by market dynamics, investor sentiments and new regulation. The path to Web3 mass adoption will be long and tedious. But keeping crypto in the spotlight distracts from blockchain’s most disruptive use cases, most of which haven’t even been dreamt up yet. It is the responsibility of advocates to explore how we can co-opt this technology to transform the long-standing institutional idea of “that’s just how things have been done” because we got too complacent to challenge it.

Share this article Humanity Protocol, a zero-knowledge decentralized identity project, has achieved a valuation of $1 billion in a round led by Kingsway Capital, with significant contributions from Animoca Brands, Blockchain.com, and other key players, according to a press release shared by the team on Wednesday. The firm said it had secured $30 million in a seed round and will use the funds to expedite the hiring process and product development, setting the stage for the public testnet launch slated for later this year. Introduced in late February this year by the Human Institute, in collaboration with Polygon Labs and Animoca Brands, Human Protocol focuses on building a proof-of-humanity identity verification solution using palm recognition technology. The project also unveils a Proof of Humanity consensus mechanism and a non-intrusive palm scanning app, aiming to establish Self-Sovereign Identity on its zkEVM blockchain. This approach is designed to ensure sybil resistance and user privacy, enhancing trust and credibility in decentralized networks and real-world applications. Humanity Protocol has already attracted over half a million waitlist sign-ups in just a month after coming out of stealth mode, the team shared in the press release. Terence Kwok, Founder of Humanity Protocol, emphasized the need for a self-sovereign identity framework that upholds inclusivity, privacy, and decentralization. “We’re creating a decentralized identity protocol that solves verifiable uniqueness and humanity in a way that protects user privacy and self-ownership of data,” Kwok stated. Manuel Stotz, Founder at Kingsway Capital, highlighted the investment’s significance in promoting digital inclusion, especially for the world’s most disadvantaged populations. “In the world of AI, as Sybil attacks continue to plague our online experiences, we’re thrilled to support industry leaders, including Terence Kwok and Yat Siu, in building a solution that will uphold the integrity of our online interactions. With their expertise and our investment, we’re confident that this initiative will pave the way for a more secure and resilient technology world for all,” Stotz noted. Yat Siu, Co-founder and Chairman of Animoca Brands, also expressed enthusiasm for the project’s potential to secure and protect users’ digital identities. “As an advocate for true digital property rights, I’m very passionate about ensuring that users’ digital identities remain secure and protected. Traditional Proof-of-Personhood methods often come with drawbacks, whether they’re too invasive, complicated, or cumbersome,” Siu stated. With its innovative Proof of Humanity mechanism, Humanity Protocol aims to become the world’s largest decentralized open identity graph, facilitating equitable transactions and services without compromising personal information.

133::https://theconversation.com/how-can-criminals-manipulate-cryptocurrency-markets-97294::The Conversation::article::How can criminals manipulate cryptocurrency markets?::Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are susceptible to fraud and price manipulation, just like any other type of investment.::Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are based on systems that are supposed to be inherently protected from fraud. Yet the U.S. Department of Justice has opened a criminal investigation into manipulation of bitcoin prices. How is that sort of activity even possible? From researching blockchain and cryptocurrencies for the past three years, I know that blockchain systems have some immutable security features. For instance, if I sent you some amount of bitcoin, and that transaction were recorded in the blockchain ledger, I couldn’t force the system to give that money back. The technology itself prevents the transaction from being reversed. But that is only true if transactions happen within the system. And there are other elements of cryptocurrency technologies that actually make fraud easier. Some of the problems the Justice Department is investigating appear to have arisen because bitcoin enthusiasts are not treating cryptocurrencies as a means of payment like dollars. Rather, they’re behaving as if bitcoins and their ilk are speculative assets like stocks and bonds. So they’re placing orders to buy bitcoin in advance, only later completing the deal. One type of fraud investigators are looking into is called “spoofing,” in which people place orders but cancel them before the deal is finalized – often without even having to pay a service fee. That makes it look like there’s more demand for bitcoin than there actually is, driving up the value of each bitcoin. That sort of manipulation is possible with almost any type of asset. Bitcoin is more susceptible than stocks or bonds because so few people hold large amounts of bitcoin. The largest 1,000 bitcoin accounts hold 40 percent of all the bitcoins in existence – with almost 20 percent held in just 100 accounts. Many of the people who own large amounts of bitcoin have been in the cryptocurrency community for a number of years and know each other. They can take coordinated actions to increase or decrease prices – and because there’s no real regulation of cryptocurrency markets, it might not even be illegal for them to do so. There are fewer protections for cryptocurrency trading, in part because it’s so new. For instance, a high volatility in stock prices would trigger “circuit breakers” in the U.S., halting trading and resetting prices to limit investors’ losses. Cryptocurrency markets have no such built-in mechanisms. Another type of fraud the Justice Department is investigating is called “wash trading,” in which one person sets up what looks like a legitimate purchase-and-sale deal, but actually does the deal with himself or herself. That makes it look like there is more activity in the market than there actually is, artificially increasing demand and value. Anyone can have as many cryptocurrency accounts as they wish to set up. And many blockchain-based systems keep users’ identities anonymous. The transactions themselves – if they actually happen – are recorded and publicly viewable, but the accounts involved are only identified with bitcoin addresses, which are long alphanumeric codes like “1ExAmpLe0FaBiTco1NADr3sSV5tsGaMF6hd.” That anonymity can make it very hard to prove that wash trading is happening and challenges law enforcement to identify and catch fraudsters. At a June 2017 congressional hearing a former federal prosecutor told of cryptocurrency investigations revealing an account set up by a person claiming to be “Mickey Mouse” living at “123 Main Street.” Some countries are starting to regulate cryptocurrency markets, either under existing regulations or new ones. In 2015, for instance, a federal investigation found that the U.S. cryptocurrency company Ripple Labs had not properly followed anti-money laundering laws and rules about getting accurate customer identification information. In May 2018, 40 jurisdictions including U.S. states, Canadian provinces and national regulators in both countries launched a formal probe dubbed “Operation Cryptosweep,” to crack down on fraudulent cryptocurrency trading. They opened as many as 70 investigations and warned roughly 35 companies about potentially violating securities laws. The vast majority of cryptocurrency trading, however, happens in countries with few regulations and lax enforcement. For instance, from early 2014 to early 2017, about 90 percent of global bitcoin trading happened through Chinese cryptocurrency exchanges. At least some of those businesses allegedly falsely inflated trading volumes to attract new customers. China has since banned online cryptocurrency trading, but people are finding loopholes. The problems will likely shift to other countries that lack strong rules, which highlights the importance of international cooperation in investigations. Cryptocurrencies are a global phenomenon; the world’s nations – especially those with lots of trading activity – will have to work together to protect consumers.::2018-05-31T10:44:24Z::Cryptocurrency::Nir Kshetri::Home::https://images.theconversation.com/files/221027/original/file-20180530-120514-16z31os.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C527%2C5501%2C2750&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
134::https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/04/05/ethereum-foundation-researchers-proposal-to-slow-eth-issuance-draws-pushback/::CoinDesk::article::Ethereum Foundation Researchers' Proposal to Slow ETH Issuance Draws Pushback::The proposal, introduced in February, could harden Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), as a form of money – by reducing the inflation of new supply. But some members of the community say if it's not broke, don't fix it. Reduction in ETH staking yield What is the role of the Ethereum Foundation?::Earlier this year, a pair of Ethereum Foundation (EF) researchers put forth a proposal to reduce the pace of new issuance of ether (ETH) tokens. It was part of a concerted plan to reduce incentives for new stakers – the investors who lock cryptocurrency into the blockchain as a way of helping to secure the network. The freshly minted ETH is a crucial component of the rewards these investors hope to receive, in the form of staking yields. As the researchers' thinking went, there's already enough stakers to provide effective security for the blockchain, and in fact any additional increases in the level of participation could enable the unwanted dominance of fast-growing third-party staking platforms like Lido. A side benefit of the proposed changes would be to harden ether as a form of money, since the total supply of the cryptocurrency wouldn't grow as quickly – effectively tapering ether's inflation rate. Now, though, some members of the community are pushing back, questioning whether there's really a need to change the tokenomics of ether and, in the extreme, whether the Ethereum Foundation plays an outsize role in influencing code upgrades on the decentralized network. The proposal was initially introduced in February by Ansgar Dietrichs and Caspar Schwarz-Schilling, both researchers at the EF. It suggests setting the blockchain's parameters so that the annual issuance of new ETH would not exceed 0.4% – a step change lower than the current effective limit of 1.5%. The big idea is that top Ethereum researchers are satisfied with the number of stakers already working to secure the network, so it might make sense to reduce the incentives for newcomers. The change would also avoid extra dilution for ETH investors. The current issuance rate "dilutes ETH holders beyond what is necessary for security," the researchers wrote. They estimated that the proposal would reduce ETH staking yields by nearly a third. Some members of the Ethereum community argue that the proposal is being rushed ahead without enough time for outside feedback. Viktor Bunin, a protocol specialist at Coinbase Cloud, wrote on the social-media platform X, “If it's not broke don't fix it.” ETH staking is the main way the Ethereum network stays secure: Ethereum's "proof-of-stake" consensus model lets users deposit ("stake") ETH with the network in exchange for yield, and to help run the chain. The substance of Dietrichs and Schwarz-Schilling's concern is that too many ETH tokens are getting staked with the network via third-party liquid staking services like Lido – crypto protocols that stake on behalf of users, and then issue derivative assets called "liquid staking tokens" (LSTs) representing their users' underlying deposits. The EF researchers say they're concerned that LSTs like Lido's stETH token – the most-traded asset on Ethereum other than the ETH token itself – could eventually replace the blockchain’s native currency as the network's de facto money, making the entire system less secure. Ethereum's security model needs ETH to be valuable in order to work, and a chief concern driving the new proposal is that if the cryptocurrency were to fall behind LSTs, it could go down in price relative to other assets. Mike Neuder, another researcher at the EF, expanded on the initial proposal by explaining that, as “real yield from staking goes to zero," stakers will need to "rely on exogenous rewards for profitability.” Reducing the ETH issuance rate could enhance Ethereum's economic model by making ETH scarcer, potentially increasing its value. Some community members, however, are pushing back on the argument that changing the tokenomics of the blockchain will improve Ethereum’s economic model. Jon Charbonneau, co-founder at crypto investment firm DBA, wrote on X that “these tweaks try to solve an unsolvable problem of fundamental tradeoffs in PoS.” PoS stands for "proof-of-stake," which is the core process or "consensus mechanism" used to secure the blockchain. Paul Dylan-Ennis, a lecturer and assistant professor at the University College Dublin School of Business, wrote that “it seems to me it's not really issuance that is at stake, so much as people have a sense that EF-associated devs and researchers appear to have an outsized power.” He added that “they are not engaging in the appropriate level of 'rough consensus' from the wider set of stakeholders.” The skepticism elicted responses from key figures within the Ethereum ecosystem, and at the Ethereum Foundation specifically. Notably, Vitalik Buterin, the influential co-founder of the Ethereum blockchain, is one of three members of the executive board of the Ethereum Foundation, according to its website. The organization is described as a "non-profit that supports the Ethereum ecosystem," and part of a "larger community of organizations and individuals that fund protocol development, grow the ecosystem and advocate for Ethereum." Tim Beiko, protocol support lead at the foundation, pushed back on Dylan-Ennis’ commentary, arguing that “it's pretty empirically untrue that 'core devs' or 'the EF' are uncontested re: governance. this current conversation is a clear example.” "Core devs" is shorthand for the broader, group of developers – drawn from multiple companies and organizations, as well as individuals – who participate in regular discussions over the network's rules, code, upgrades and strategy roadmap. Beiko added that: “I think core devs + researchers generally treat ethresearch+ethmag as a place to post WIP ideas/proposals, whereas the broader community tends to perceive it as a place where the Official Roadmap gets shared after it's ~final.” Dietrichs, the co-author of the initial proposal, responded that the "intention was purely to propose this change for consideration to the community." “Of course any change to such a sensitive part of the protocol requires broad community buy-in," Dietrichs wrote. "We tried to be clear about that from the beginning, but could certainly have done a better job.” Read more: Ethereum Finalizes 'Dencun' Upgrade, in Landmark Move to Reduce Data Fees Disclosure Please note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.

Buterin’s vision and technical expertise have not only brought success to the Ethereum network but also helped to shape the entire blockchain landscape. Read on to learn about Buterin and his contributions and visions for the future of Ethereum. Vitalik Buterin is the co-founder of the Ethereum network, a decentralized blockchain and development platform. Born in Kolomma, Russia, on Jan. 31, 1994, Vitalik’s family left for Canada to seek better employment opportunities. At the time they left, he was six years old. Vitalik Buterin’s skills saw him enrolled in a gifted program in the third grade at a Canadian primary school. He had distinct programming skills and an early interest in economics. Buterin demonstrated remarkable mathematical prowess. Despite his academic talents, he was distant from social events and extracurricular activities, earning him the reputation of a math prodigy. Outside academics, Buterin enjoyed playing World of Warcraft from 2007 to 2010. However, his experience with the game was altered when the game’s developer, Blizzard, nerfed his highly prized favorite character. That was when he realized flaws in centralized systems, prompting him to quit. Following high school, Buterin enrolled at the University of Waterloo, pursuing advanced courses and serving as a research assistant for Ian Goldberg, a known cryptographer. Goldberg, known for co-creating Off-the-Record Messaging and his involvement with the Tor Project, mentored Buterin during this time. In 2012, Buterin achieved further recognition by winning the bronze medal at the International Olympiad in Informatics held in Italy. Vitalik’s net worth primarily stems from his cryptocurrency holdings, which reportedly exceed $866 million at the current market value. Notably, most of his wealth is attributed to his ETH holdings. Buterin holds a substantial amount of ETH, totaling 278,426 ETH and 248 WETH ($919K). This makes him one of the largest holders of ETH, constituting approximately 0.23% of all ETH in circulation. However, determining Buterin’s exact net worth is challenging due to undisclosed non-crypto assets and potential undisclosed crypto holdings. Vitalik Buterin has achieved a lot throughout his career. In 2014, Buterin was awarded the Thiel Fellowship, a prestigious grant that allowed him to focus on developing Ethereum. The following year, Buterin’s groundbreaking work on Ethereum earned him the World Technology Award in the IT Software category. This award celebrated his contributions to technology and innovation, solidifying his reputation as a visionary within the industry. In addition, Buterin was included in Fortune magazine’s esteemed “40 under 40” list in 2016, acknowledging his leadership and impact as a young innovator. In June 2017, Vitalik Buterin met with Russian President Vladimir Putin during the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. The meeting was aimed at discussing the economic significance of Ethereum for Russia. In 2018, Buterin received further recognition for his achievements. Forbes featured him in its “30 under 30” list, highlighting his exceptional accomplishments and potential across various industries. He was also honored with an honorary doctorate from the University of Basel for his contributions to blockchain and Ethereum. Buterin’s influence in the cryptocurrency and blockchain sector was further underscored by his inclusion in Fortune’s “The Ledger 40 under 40” list. His impact also went beyond industry boundaries, as evidenced by his inclusion in Time magazine’s prestigious Time 100 list in 2021, which honored him for his contributions to technology and cryptocurrencies on a global scale. In 2018, the Ethereum community celebrated Buterin’s dedication and contributions with the Vitalik Buterin Community Award. This acknowledgment recognized his unparalleled commitment to advancing the Ethereum ecosystem and fostering its growth and development. Vitalik Buterin’s philanthropic efforts have been quite transparent. In October, Buterin clarified on his social platforms that when articles suggest that he is selling ETH, the transactions are made by charities, non-profits, or other projects to cover fees associated with his donations. He added that he has not sold any ETH for personal gains since 2018. In 2021, Buterin donated over $1 billion in crypto to various charities, including the India Covid Relief fund. The funds came from selling dog-themed meme coins he was gifted by the creators of Akita Inu (AKITA), Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogelon (ELON). Buterin established Kanro, his charitable entity, to combat pandemics, focusing on addressing the challenges posed by COVID-19. Currently, Kanro’s publicly known address holds approximately 75 million USDC stablecoins. Vitalik Buterin donated USD 1.5 billion in cryptocurrency According to Jutel this was a demonstrative gesture of the legitimacy game that encompasses crypto-speculators, blockchain humanitarians and technology solution developers. https://t.co/btR0rodtgj pic.twitter.com/bktHOqJf5u In addition to Kanro, Buterin has made donations, primarily in ether. Some recipients were 13,292 ETH to GiveWell, a charity evaluator, 1,000 ETH, and 430 billion ELON tokens to the Methuselah Foundation, which is focused on extending the human lifespan. He also donated 1050 ETH to the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, which aims at safe AI technologies. Vitalik Buterin is primarily known as the co-founder of Ethereum, the second-largest crypto by market cap. Since launching Ethereum, Vitalik has remained a central figure in its development. He is the platform’s public face, contributes to its technical direction, and advocates for its adoption. Buterin also has a background in computer science. His programming skills were instrumental in building Ethereum, and he continues to be a thought leader and advisor in blockchain technology. Apart from that, as outlined above, Vitalik has been involved in charitable contributions, particularly medical research and global health initiatives. Vitalik Buterin is important for co-founding Ethereum. Ethereum introduced smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements that have opened doors to various applications beyond just crypto. Beyond Ethereum, Buterin is a prominent figure in blockchain and crypto. His technical knowledge and vision for the future of the technology are widely respected. At 30, Buterin has become a significant figure in the crypto industry, often compared to Satoshi Nakamoto in significance. His contributions have solidified his position as a key player in shaping the future of the crypto space. In 2011, seeking a new direction, Buterin stumbled upon Bitcoin. Initially skeptical due to its lack of physical backing, he gradually became intrigued as he looked deeper into its workings and potential. Desiring to participate actively in this sector, Buterin looked to acquire Bitcoin but lacked the resources to mine or purchase them outright. Instead, he turned to online forums, where he began writing articles for a blog, earning approximately 5 BTC per piece. ➫ Vitalik Buterin created $ETH at 19, and now his net worth is over $1.2B, making him the youngest crypto billionaire according to Forbes He is one of the most influential people in crypto, so knowing his views can help predict the future I've watched ~100 hours of his… pic.twitter.com/cPDw6W8JwE Buterin explored crypto’s economic, technological, and political dimensions. His writings caught the attention of Mihai Alisie, a fellow Bitcoin enthusiast based in Romania. This led to the creation of the Bitcoin Magazine, which Buterin co-founded in late 2011. Juggling writing, travel, and crypto work for over 30 hours weekly, Buterin decided to leave university. Buterin traveled the world researching various altcoins. He deduced that existing projects were too narrowly focused and lacked versatility. Buterin believed that a successful blockchain should have more applications and more adaptability. He recognized the potential for generalizing the protocols already in place and used Turing-complete programming languages to develop the idea of Ethereum. Despite initial rejections from existing projects, he created the network and wrote the Ethereum whitepaper. In early 2014, Buterin collaborated with a group of visionaries, including Gavin Wood, Anthony Di Iorio, Charles Hoskinson, and Joseph Lubin, to establish Ethereum. Together, they initiated an initial coin offering (ICO) campaign to finance the platform’s development, offering ETH coins in exchange for contributions. The campaign exceeded expectations, raising over $18 million in Bitcoin. With the funding, Ethereum began developing the platform, focusing on enabling smart contracts and decentralized applications. Ethereum introduced Solidity, a new programming language for writing smart contracts. In July 2015, Ethereum launched the Frontier network, its initial implementation. Since then, the ETH ecosystem has undergone multiple upgrades, including the Metropolis, Constantinople, Istanbul hard forks, and the Ethereum Merge, enhancing its capabilities and scalability. Vitalik Buterin has encountered several technical challenges throughout Ethereum’s development. Ethereum is a complex, secure, and scalable platform that has had technical challenges. Some of these that Buterin has addressed are ensuring smart contract security, achieving scalability in handling high transaction volumes, and balancing decentralization with efficiency. Since everything on a public blockchain is transparent, user privacy has also been a major point of discussion. Balancing the need for transparency with the desire for anonymity has been an ongoing effort. The Ethereum blockchain developed use cases such as decentralized applications (DApps) and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). However, it faced a significant setback with the launch of the DAO in April 2016. Intended to revolutionize crowdfunding, the DAO quickly raised around $150 million in ETH. However, vulnerabilities in its codebase led to an exploit, resulting in the theft of 3.6 million ETH, roughly $50 million at the time. In response, Vitalik Buterin decided to fork the Ethereum network to stop the hack and restore the stolen funds. The inability to reconcile these differences led to the Ethereum blockchain splitting into two separate chains: Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). Ethereum moved forward with the fork to recover the stolen funds, while Ethereum Classic remained on the original blockchain. ETH became more popular over time and attracted the support of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, which had over 200 members, including JP Morgan and Citigroup. Vitalik Buterin recognized that Ethereum’s proof-of-work (PoW) version led to soaring Ethereum gas fees, making transactions too expensive for many users. This delay prompted Buterin to acknowledge that Ethereum’s transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism would take six years instead of the projected one. To address the need for improved transaction throughput and congestion management, Ethereum adopted sharding as part of the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade (Merge). Sharding divides the network into shard chains, distributing the load and aiming to boost transaction throughput and relieve congestion. The Merge integrated Ethereum’s original mainnet with its new proof-of-stake Beacon Chain. This transition eliminated energy-intensive mining and enabled the network to be secured through staked ETH. However, Buterin and his team’s adoption of a more centralized approach has departed from the decentralized strategy previously favored by Ethereum community members. In addition, holders’ expectations have shifted, viewing ETH as an investment asset rather than a decentralized currency. Did you know? The name Ethereum was inspired by a medieval theory about an invisible, all-pervasive substance called “ether.” In a student testimonial at Abelard School, Vitalik Buterin reiterated his experience working on Ethereum and in the crypto industry in general: “I am truly grateful to have the opportunity to work in such an interesting and interdisciplinary area of industry, where I have the chance to interact with cryptographers, mathematicians, and economists prominent in their fields to help build software and tools that already affect tens of thousands of people around the world and to work on advanced problems in computer science, economics, and philosophy every week.” Buterin’s involvement in blockchain projects beyond Ethereum, like L4 and Plasma Group, signals his interest in contributing to the emerging metaverse. In a July 2022 post on X, Buterin criticized Meta Platform’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, suggesting corporate attempts to create the metaverse might fail. Buterin believes it’s too early to define the metaverse and that any current attempts may misfire. Given Ethereum’s role as the foundation for various developments such as DeFi, NFTs, and stablecoins, it’s unsurprising that Buterin expects the network to lead in the metaverse space. The "metaverse" is going to happen but I don't think any of the existing corporate attempts to intentionally create the metaverse are going anywhere. https://t.co/tVUfq4CWmP Buterin also sees the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) ecosystem as providing web3 usernames for crypto addresses and decentralized websites and enabling cross-platform identities for users and items. He believes ENS offers solutions that many people overlook. Buterin is fascinated by Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs), a cryptographic proof allowing a party to prove possession of specific information without revealing it. This eliminates the need for interaction between the prover and verifier. Buterin predicts zk-SNARKs will become the most widely used privacy-preserving technology in the next three decades. He calls it a potential revolution as it becomes mainstream in the next 10-20 years. Buterin has outlined future plans for Ethereum, such as implementing sharding for scalability (the Surge), introducing Verkle trees for efficiency (the Verge), reducing storage requirements (the Purge), and enhancing quantum resistance (the Splurge). Ethereum operates as a decentralized blockchain platform built by developers worldwide. No single entity controls it. While the Ethereum Foundation was important in creating the initial infrastructure and continues to support development, control over the network has shifted to the larger Ethereum community. Ethereum’s decentralized governance model ensures that no single entity or individual can unilaterally change the platform, including the Ethereum Foundation or Vitalik Buterin. Instead, decisions are made collectively by the community, which includes developers, node operators, and ETH holders. The network’s success relies on the participation of the community members. They perform activities such as staking and securing the network through node operations and ETH holdings. With hundreds of thousands of developers contributing to the platform’s ongoing development, Ethereum remains a decentralized and collaborative ecosystem. Ethereum Improvement Proposals, or EIPs, allow the community to propose improvements to the network. Any crypto community member can submit EIPs via GitHub. Once proposed, they undergo discussion and review by the Ethereum community, including editors, for approval. In addition, forum members and Ethereum enthusiasts engage in discussions, providing feedback to the proposal’s author. EIPs can cover various aspects of the Ethereum network. An example of is changes to the ERC-20 technical standard, which governs Ethereum transactions. Vitalik Buterin has played a significant role in Ethereum’s development and evolution. As co-founder and leader, he has spearheaded updates such as Ethereum 2.0, which transitioned the network to proof-of-stake and propelled Ethereum to the forefront of the blockchain revolution. Beyond Ethereum contributions, Buterin’s commitment to innovation has been a driver in transforming the blockchain space.  Vitalik Buterin’s inspiration for Ethereum started when the developer changed his character in World of Warcraft, highlighting the downsides of centralized control. In addition, while impressed with Bitcoin and other projects in the crypto industry, he envisioned a platform that would be adaptable and have more applications.Hence, Ethereum was created as a blockchain that facilitates the creation of decentralized applications (DApps) using smart contracts, among other use cases. Vitalik Buterin introduced Ethereum, which opened doors for decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other applications beyond digital currencies. Vitalik’s ongoing research, writing, and public speaking have also shaped the conversation around blockchain technology. Vitalik Buterin’s awards include recognition for his technical contributions (Thiel Fellowship, World Technology Award), leadership in the tech industry (Fortune 40 under 40, Forbes 30 under 30), and influence within the blockchain space (Honorary Doctorate, Fortune the ledger 40 under 40, Vitalik Buterin Community Award). Time Magazine even recognized him for his global impact on technology and cryptocurrency. Vitalik remains a prominent figure in Ethereum’s development. He is key in shaping its roadmap and proposing solutions for technical challenges like scalability and privacy. His ideas and research papers on scalability solutions (sharding) and Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanisms influence conversations around the blockchain space. Vitalik Buterin’s future vision for Ethereum includes implementing sharding for scalability (the Surge), introducing Verkle trees for efficiency (the Verge), reducing storage requirements (the Purge), and enhancing quantum resistance (the Splurge). Vitalik Buterin is most famous for co-founding Ethereum, a leading blockchain platform that introduced smart contracts. He is also recognized for his philanthropy and advocacy for decentralization in the blockchain space. In May 2024, Vitalik’s net worth is estimated to be around $866 million at the current market value. The majority of this is from his Ethereum collection. While the information on Vitalik Buterin’s IQ has never been released officially, several sources cite 257. Notably, an IQ level above 130 is considered high. Hence, Buterin’s IQ, which is almost twice that, is very high. Ethereum’s top holders are mostly crypto exchanges, including Binance with 7.2 million ETH and Huobi with 3.3 million ETH. Other major holders include the Ethereum Foundation, with 2.9 million ETH. Meanwhile, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is one of the largest individual holders, with 278K ETH. Vitalik Buterin is widely recognized as the Ethereum co-founder, with others like Gavin Wood, Anthony Di Iorio, Charles Hoskinson, and Joseph Lubin playing major roles in the project’s early development. Vitalik Buterin reportedly has 278,524 ETH (~$1M) and 256 WETH ($919K), making him one of the largest ETH holders. In May 2024, Vitalik’s net worth is estimated to be around $866 million at the current market value.

136::https://blockworks.co/news/music-industry-blockchain-bandcamp::Blockworks::article::The music industry could learn a few lessons from blockchain::Opinion: Digital ownership is inevitable, but let’s be realistic about the problems it solves.::Bandcamp’s drama and community response has reminded us that the investments we make into centralized internet products are neither owned by us nor permanent Midjourney modified by Blockworks I spent twenty years building digital music applications and businesses, most recently Beats Music and Apple Music, previously with Yahoo!, Winamp, Topspin and Beastie Boys. Today, I work at Ledger and espouse the utility of crypto instead, so I’m often asked the question, “What about music on the blockchain?” “Meh,” is my standard response. I don’t see the innovation or consumer need in asking people to buy digital music NFTs like they bought CDs, or trying to shoehorn digital ownership into streaming services meant to compete with Spotify. Listening to music on the internet is a solved problem, and music listeners don’t need the help of a blockchain to hear what they want. Just say, “Hey Siri, play The Beatles,” to remind yourself just how far we’ve come since Napster. The business of music rights is an oligopoly controlled by three major labels and four digital music services, none of whom have an interest in open standards. But the two-sided marketplace of Bandcamp is a great place to consider the value blockchains can and will add to the artist/fan relationship, and how that change will come slowly over the next fifteen years. Below is a thought exercise using Bandcamp to demonstrate where digital ownership can meaningfully change the paradigm without asking consumers to change their habits all at once. For music fans — and in particular, fans of niche genres such as heavy metal and contemporary jazz — Bandcamp is beloved. The site launched in 2008 and bloomed slowly, building a passionate community of music lovers over fifteen years. The functionality of Bandcamp.com is simple: Stream for free, buy digital for around $10, and often buy vinyl (Bandcamp actually bought a pressing plant to help the creator side of their marketplace press vinyl), as well as t-shirts or other physical collectibles from the artist. Artists receive a net average of 82% of every sale, and Bandcamp has paid out around $1 billion to artists and labels selling on the site since its launch. But in March 2022, Bandcamp was sold to Epic Games. “Bandcamp will play an important role in Epic’s vision to build out a creator marketplace ecosystem,” Epic Games wrote in a statement. Bandcamp unionized in March 2023, and when Epic Games announced it was laying off 16% of its total workforce in September, a sale of Bandcamp to Songtradr was announced. Only 50% of the Bandcamp staff was retained and the community voiced its concern for the future of Bandcamp loudly culminating in this Pitchfork article: “Is Bandcamp as we know it over?”. Bandcamp’s drama and community response has reminded us — like MySpace, Flickr and so many other platforms before — that the investments we make into centralized internet products are neither owned by us nor permanent. At the end of the day, these are for-profit companies with investors looking for outcomes. Our investments into the platform are of value for them, not for us. The digital albums purchased, as well as the “relationship” between the artist and consumer, are owned by Bandcamp. If they disappear, so does the artist’s access to their fanbase and the listener’s backup of the music they’ve paid for. With decentralized ownership, this could be fundamentally different. If I were at the helm, here is how I would modify Bandcamp: The ambitions could be set higher than I suggest above — digital packaging and payouts to creative collaborators like Metalabel is building would be very useful in the Bandcamp context. Read more from our opinion section: You aren’t thinking hard enough about digital art You could also imagine artists earning ownership in Bandcamp based on performance and a revenue stream for artists where the profits of the platform are paid out based on this ownership (what Visa was for banks, Bandcamp could be for artists). But I like the simple thought experience described in the bullet points above particularly because the changes are subtle and simple, yet meaningful to both artists and fans, without asking either to change their behavior overnight. But we should keep this in perspective — the entire recorded music industry made $26 billion in revenue in 2022, whereas Bandcamp has paid out just $1 billion to artists since 2008. Also, the examples above speak to how application developers in categories beyond music will integrate digital ownership slowly and optionally for their customers, rather than a Web3 “big bang” overnight. Digital ownership is inevitable, but let’s be realistic about the problems it solves and how quickly this new paradigm is arriving to mainstream consumers.

However, it has since plummeted, now sitting at an 84% decrease from its all-time high. Etherscan, the Ethereum blockchain explorer, reveals that although SHIBA is not available on centralized crypto trading platforms such as Coinbase and Binance, it has garnered significant trading volume, reaching almost $250,000 million within a 24-hour span on Uniswap, a well-known decentralized exchange. CryptoGlobe reported the surge in SHIBA’s price earlier this month, linking the price hike to the token’s low liquidity. Ethereum blockchain data indicates that SHIBA has been part of 28,200 transactions and is held by 2,047 owners. The cryptocurrency has experienced a sharp decline in value, dropping approximately 84.4% from its highest point at $0.0000000078, now hovering around $0.00000000121. On its official website, SHIBA positions itself as the “rebirth of the DOGE killer,” expressing anticipation for a new leader in the crypto space while highlighting the enthusiasm of Shiba whales. The site also addresses past disappointments in the market, stating, “the Shiba whales have their eyes blazing,” and proclaiming that it’s “time for the birth of a new king, a new Doge Killer of 2023, $SHIBA.” SHIBA’s token supply structure is detailed on its website, explaining that 47% of the total, equivalent to 470 trillion tokens, are set to be “burned at launch.” An additional 300 trillion tokens will be “removed from circulation at launch.” The token allocation includes 5% for potential listings on centralized exchanges, 5% for a “marketing and development fund,” 4% for an ecosystem fund, 4% for funding cross-chain trading platforms, and another 5% designated for the project’s team. In a move reminiscent of its meme-crypto counterpart Shiba Inu ($SHIB), SHIBA has also introduced a token named $BONES, designated as the “official gas token for Shibarium chain.” source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

138::https://cryptobriefing.com/layerzero-sybil-self-report/::Crypto Briefing::article::LayerZero CEO confirms 100,000 wallets self-report Sybil activity::The project's co-founder calls the fight against the Sybil attack an "eternal battle of good vs evil."::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Bryan Pellegrino, CEO of LayerZero Labs, announced that up to 100,000 wallets self-reported their Sybil behavior. According to Pellegrino, this data collection will be considerably valuable in identifying participants using similar methods and software for fraudulent activities in the future. “My intuition is that a confirmed data set of 100,000+ is going to be extremely powerful in finding others either using same software or similar methodologies. Can’t wait to see what it yields,” he stated, adding that those who haven’t self-reported should disclose their activity. The update comes after the project said it would give Sybil airdrop farmers a chance to self-report by May 17. According to the team, users who voluntarily disclose their Sybil activity will get 15% of the initial airdrop tokens. However, those who fail to self-report and are later identified will be excluded from token allocation. In addition, LayerZero has entered into strategic partnerships with Nansen, a leading analytics firm, and Chaos Labs, a prominent security company. The goal is to analyze transactions across LayerZero applications and prioritize the support of developers and committed users. The comprehensive report on Sybil detection is expected to be released after the self-reporting deadline. While self-reporting has reached a large scale, some users remain skeptical. A user named Moriarty has openly doubted LayerZero’s detection capabilities, taunting the company and urging Pellegrino to find his 25,000 hidden Sybil wallets. Pellegrino said it was a war between good and evil and told Moriarty to wait for the final results. He previously noted that only 400,000 to 600,000 out of 6 million user accounts were real.

139::https://theconversation.com/blockchains-focusing-on-bitcoin-misses-the-real-revolution-in-digital-trust-58125::The Conversation::article::Blockchains: Focusing on bitcoin misses the real revolution in digital trust::The transaction system underlying the bitcoin network has far broader uses than easing financial transfers – including identifying people and tracking property ownership.::In 2008, short of sending a suitcase full of cash, there was essentially just one way for an individual to send money between, say, the United States and Europe. You had to wire the money through a mainstream financial service, like Western Union or a bank. That meant paying high fees and waiting up to several days for the money to arrive. A radically new option arose in 2009 with the introduction of bitcoin. Bitcoin makes it possible to transfer value between two individuals anywhere in the world quickly and at minimal cost. It is often called a “cryptocurrency,” as it is purely digital and uses cryptography to protect against counterfeiting. The software that executes this cryptography runs simultaneously on computers around the world. Even if one or more of these computers is misused in an attempt to corrupt the bitcoin network (such as to steal money), the collective action of the others ensures the integrity of the system as a whole. Its distributed nature also enables bitcoin to process transactions without the fees, antiquated networks and (for better or worse) the rules governing intermediaries like banks and wire services. Bitcoin’s exciting history and social impact have fired imaginations. The aggregate market value of all issued bitcoins today is roughly US$10 billion. The computing devices that maintain its blockchain are geographically dispersed and owned by thousands of different individuals, so the bitcoin network has no single owner or point of control. Even its creator remains a mystery (despite many efforts to unmask her, him or them). Bitcoin’s lack of government regulation made it attractive to black markets and malware writers. Although the core system is well-secured, people who own bitcoins have experienced a litany of heists and fraud. Even more than the currency itself, though, what has drawn the world’s attention are the unprecedented reliability and security of bitcoin’s underlying transaction system, called a blockchain. Researchers, entrepreneurs, and developers believe that blockchains will solve a stunning array of problems, such as stabilization of financial systems, identification of stateless persons, establishing title to real estate and media, and efficiently managing supply chains. Despite its richly varied applications, a blockchain such as bitcoin’s aims to realize a simple goal. Abstractly, it can be viewed as creating a kind of public bulletin board, often called a “distributed ledger.” This ledger is public. Anyone – plebeian or plutocrat, baker or banker – can read it. And anyone can write valid data to it. Specifically, in bitcoin, any owner of money can add a transaction to the ledger that transfers some of her money to someone else. The bitcoin network makes sure that the ledger includes only authorized transactions, meaning those digitally signed by the owners of the money being transferred. The key feature of blockchains is that new data may be written at any time, but can never be changed or erased. At first glance, this etched-in-stone rule seems a needless design restriction. But it gives rise to a permanent, ever-growing transactional history that creates strong transparency and accountability. For example, the bitcoin blockchain contains a record of every transaction in the system since its birth. This feature makes it possible to prevent account holders from reneging on transactions, even if their identities remain anonymous. Once in the ledger, a transaction is undeniable. The indelible nature of the ledger is much more powerful and general, though, allowing blockchains to support applications well beyond bitcoin. Consider, for example, the management of title to a piece of land or property. Property registries in many parts of the world today are fragmented, incomplete, poorly maintained, and difficult to access. The legal uncertainty surrounding ownership of property is a major impediment to growth in developing economies. Were property titles authoritatively and publicly recorded on a blockchain, anyone could learn instantly who has title to a piece of property. Even legitimate anonymous ownership – as through a private trust – could be recorded on a blockchain. Such transparency would help resolve legal ambiguity and shed light on malfeasance. Advocates envision similar benefits in blockchain recording of media rights – such as rights to use images or music – identity documents and shipping manifests. In addition, the decentralized nature of the database provides resilience not just to technical failures, but also to political ones – failed states, corruption and graft. Blockchains can be enhanced to support not just transactions, but also pieces of code known as smart contracts. A smart contract is a program that controls assets on the blockchain – anything from cryptocurrency to media rights – in ways that guarantee predictable behavior. A smart contract may be viewed as playing the role of a trusted third party: Whatever task it is programmed to do, it will carry out faithfully. Suppose for example that a user wishes to auction off a piece of land for which her rights are represented on a blockchain. She could hire an auctioneer, or use an online auction site. But that would require her and her potential customers to trust, without proof, that the auctioneer conducts the auction honestly. To achieve greater transparency, the user could instead create a smart contract that executes the auction automatically. She would program the smart contract with the ability to deliver the item to be sold and with rules about minimum bids and bidding deadlines. She would also specify what the smart contract is to do at the end of the auction: send the winning bid amount from the winner to the seller’s account and transfer the land title to the winner. Because the blockchain is publicly visible, anyone with suitable expertise could check that the code in the smart contract implements a fair and valid auction. Auction participants would only need to trust the correctness of the code. They wouldn’t need to rely on an auctioneer to run the auction honestly – and as an added benefit, they also wouldn’t need to pay high auctioneer fees. Behind this compelling vision lurk many technical challenges. The transparency and accountability of a fully public ledger have many benefits, but are at odds with confidentiality. Suppose the seller mentioned above wanted to conduct a sealed-bid auction or conceal the winning bid amount? How could she do this on a blockchain that everyone can read? Achieving both transparency and confidentiality on blockchains is in fact possible, but requires new techniques under development by researchers. Another challenge is ensuring that smart contracts correctly reflect user intent. A lawyer, arbiter or court can remedy defects or address unforeseen circumstances in written contracts. Smart contracts, though, are expressly designed as unalterable code. This inflexibility avoids ambiguity and cheating and ensures trustworthy execution, but it can also cause brittleness. An excellent example was the recent theft of around $55 million in cryptocurrency from a smart contract. The thief exploited a software bug, and the smart contract creators couldn’t fix it once the contract was running. Bitcoin is a proof of concept of the viability of blockchains. As researchers and developers overcome the technical challenges of smart contracts and other blockchain innovations, marveling at money flying across the Atlantic will someday seem quaint.::2016-07-18T10:17:17Z::Bitcoin, Blockchain, Smart contract::Ari Juels::Home::https://images.theconversation.com/files/130594/original/image-20160714-23327-ng4s5m.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C184%2C1600%2C776&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
140::https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/01/26/which-is-the-best-self-custody-lightning-wallet/::CoinDesk::article::Which Is the Best Self-Custody Lightning Wallet?::Bitcoin educator Anita Posch tested the Blixt, Green, Mutiny, Phoenix and Zeus Lightning wallets while traveling in Zimbabwe. Lightning wallets tested and goal Choosing the test location The testing process Payment costs Features and differences Second test in urban area with LTE connection Overall rankings for Lightning self-custody Conclusion::I'm conducting my second test of self-custodial Lightning wallets in Zimbabwe, to see which might be best for any rural area. Given that none of the available self-custodial wallets are developed by Africans, they are rarely used or tested here. On top of that, Lightning is still new and complex, building mobile apps that are running a node of the network on your phone is challenging. I am here to find out what works and what does not. As an educator, I recommend tools for everyday users, who want to send small payments. These tools have to be reliable, otherwise people might conclude that Bitcoin isn't for them. Anita Posch is a world-renowned Bitcoin educator, author of the book "(L)earn Bitcoin" and founder of the online academy Crack the Orange as well as non-profit initiative Bitcoin for Fairness. I opened my first Lightning channel on an app called BLW in January 2019. I’m used to testing new tools, that’s why I have no problem if challenges and bugs arise. But regular users may not be as forgiving, that’s why I aim to only recommend tools I’ve personally tested. In 2023, the only two self-custody Lightning wallets available were Breez and Phoenix. This year I had more choices and tested: Blixt, Mutiny, Green, Zeus and Phoenix. I also included the Wallet of Satoshi, a custodial wallet, just to see how it performs in comparison. I was familiar with Phoenix and used Zeus connected to my Voltage node earlier. Mutiny, Blixt and the Lightning integration in Blockstream’s Green wallet just popped up in the last few months, so using them was new for me too. All of the wallets have been undergoing huge changes and will continue to evolve. I had to download Mutiny manually and install a special .apk file used on Android phones. For the Green wallet, I asked BlockStream to unlock its experimental Greenlight feature in order to test it. My goal was to find out which of the wallets are the best in sending and receiving bitcoin in a reliable, fast, easy to use manner and to compare the costs involved. See also: Coinbase CEO Confirms Exchange Will Support Lightning Before heading to the rural areas (I intended to test the wallets under suboptimal conditions), I set up the wallets and opened a Lightning payments channel in Harare as I anticipated low internet signal challenges. Based on my year-long experience in Zimbabwe, I’ve learned that even with decent internet speed, the upload and download of files as small as 2 MB can be problematic. I used the internet at a friend’s house to use the fastest internet provider in Harare called Liquid, which is also the most expensive with a monthly cost of $300 for unlimited usage. My speed test results for download were 92.7 Mbps and upload 14.6 Mbps. Even with that fast internet it took me some time to install the apps, secure the private keys and open a Lightning channel to be a part of the network. To ensure consistency, I followed a test protocol for each wallet. On Dec. 26 and 27, I installed the wallets and sent 100,000 sats (~$42 at current prices) to open a Lightning channel. A channel on the Lightning Network needs two transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain to be set up. That way the channel is constantly connected to the blockchain, which is why the bitcoin on the Bitcoin blockchain and bitcoin on the Lightning network are the same. There is no difference in the value, it’s the same unit, not another token or asset. There are several ways to open a channel: sending on-chain bitcoin, transferring Lightning directly from another wallet or through a swap from Liquid or some wallets are offering buying inbound liquidity. I tried them all to send the first bitcoin to the wallets, affecting set-up speed and fees I had to pay. See also: Bitcoin Could See Growth in Layer-2 Ecosystem, Drawing on Ethereum's Experience I used a Lightning payment to open a channel on all wallets, except for Blixt, as I only found the on-chain option there (except for liquidity providers). Seemingly, Blixt is opening the channel with a second on-chain transaction while the other wallets conceal that second transaction somehow, because the channel opened immediately after the first transaction confirmation. Not with Blixt: I sent the first transaction and the confirmation took some hours, it was evening already, so I had to leave the friend's house. As soon as it was confirmed, Blixt carried out the second on-chain transaction, which took again several hours because the mempool was full. When the second transaction was confirmed I was back in the house where I'm living, with internet speed only around 3 Mbps download, 0.26 upload and a Ping over 300ms. Blixt wasn't able to open the channel in these circumstances. I needed to go back to my friend's house to finish the channel opening. It's hard to say how other wallets would have performed under these conditions. For the channel openings on Green and Zeus, I used Liquid, swapped via Boltz.exchange to Lightning, due to high transaction fees at the time. Opening a channel from Liquid is far more economical in that situation. Liquid is a sidechain of Bitcoin, its unit is called L-BTC. Learn the differences between Bitcoin, Lightning, Liquid, and E-Cash in this non-technical explainer. One BTC is pegged to one L-BTC. This means if you peg-in 0.1 BTC to Liquid, the resulting 0.1 L-BTC are of the same value as BTC. Compared to self-custodial Lightning there is more trust involved in using Liquid, because you have to go through intermediaries for the peg-in and peg-out and trust a federation of 15 companies, who are the signers for Liquid transactions, whereas on Bitcoin and Lightning you don‘t have to trust any intermediaries. The upside of the Liquid blockchain is that the transaction speed, privacy are higher and currently the fees are lower than on the Bitcoin blockchain. I compared all network fees, transaction, and service fees that applied with the different methods of opening a channel. The cost of the incoming transaction to open the channel was the highest with Blixt as I used bitcoin on-chain at a time when the average fee rate was 110 sat/vByte ($0.000054). Channel opening was the cheapest when using Lightning directly from another LN wallet. The route using Liquid and Boltz was a little bit more expensive than using Lightning. The available balance after opening the channel varied significantly. Zeus had the lowest balance of 52,500 sats, while Green had the highest at 97,500 sats. This difference was surprising, especially since I used Liquid for both. Green was the clear winner with a cost of 3.5%, whereas Zeus was by far the most expensive wallet with 48.5% of the funds spent in opening the channel. Mutiny offered the biggest channel capacity and the highest receivable amount with 100,000 sats, while at the same time it was the second most expensive. However, a drawback of Green was its limited incoming capacity of only 4,133 sats. After the initial set-up, I set out to do the payment test on Jan. 1, 2024. I strolled through the scorching heat, making my way up to the kopje, navigating through rocks, grass, bushes and trees 30 km out of the capitaI Harare. My friends were captivated by the beautiful flowers that bloom as soon as the rainy season begins. My focus, however, was on finding a decent internet signal for my two phones. Having prepared the test back in Harare, I was eager to carry it out in this setting. After 30 minutes of searching, I realized that the network coverage was inconsistent, regardless of whether I used NetOne or Econet. I was able to send WhatsApp messages, but as soon as I wanted to download an image with 0.5 MB, I had to wait or turn airplane mode on and off to be back in the game. Finally, I settled on a shaded spot with a stable NetOne signal to set up a hotspot for my other devices. I prepared my devices – my Google Pixel 4, iPhone 13 Pro and my iPad Air (3rd generation). The iPad was included because I already had Phoenix wallets on my other two devices, and for this test, I wanted to start with a fresh installation. Now seated on some rocks, surrounded by trees and bushes, as I fend off large ants attempting to crawl up under my trousers I found 4.21 Mbps download and 0.36 Mbps upload. Glad that I set up the apps already a few days earlier. See also: Bitcoin and Stablecoins Will Bring Crypto Mass Adoption to Africa My speed test results showed a ping of 90 and a download speed of 4.6 Mbps and an upload speed 0.5 Mbps. When I started testing the wallets, the Phoenix wallet opened immediately. The Green wallet took 13 seconds to open and the Mutiny wallet needed 18 seconds. However, Zeus didn't open at all, even after a 150-second wait. Similarly, Blixt opened but failed to sync the channels and wallet, so I couldn't use it. As expected, the custodial Wallet of Satoshi opened immediately. My first test was to send 50,000 sats from the different wallets to my Phoenix wallet on my iPhone. So, the Phoenix wallet on the iPhone was on the receiving end. Unfortunately, I could not send from Blixt because, as I said before, it did not sync at all. Zeus was also unusable since it wouldn't even start up. When I attempted a payment with Zeus, it failed after a five minute wait. The Green wallet's payment attempt was unsuccessful too, displaying an error message after I waited for two and a half minutes. With the Mutiny wallet, I almost wanted to stop but after 50 seconds, I was able to send the payment successfully. The Phoenix wallet was the quickest, completing the transfer in just three seconds. And interestingly, the custodial Wallet of Satoshi was slower than Phoenix, taking nine seconds for the payment to go through. I didn't anticipate this result, but I found it amusing. The next test focused on receiving 30,000 sats from the Phoenix wallet on my iPhone, which had previously served as the receiving wallet. The results were somewhat similar to the previous test. The time until the payment was sent from Phoenix was three seconds and it showed up in Mutiny, Phoenix and the Wallet of Satoshi immediately. Blixt did not work. With Green, the payment failed after I waited for 35 seconds. Similarly, Zeus also failed to receive the payment after I waited for one and half minutes. For this test, I sent 20,000 sats to a Lightning address, using the Wallet of Satoshi as the recipient since I had access to its Lightning address. The results were somewhat consistent with previous tests but with a notable exception. Surprisingly, the Green wallet managed to send to a Lightning address this time, completing the payment in 40 seconds. This was unexpected given its previous failures in other tests. Blixt and Zeus didn't work. Mutiny, Phoenix and Wallet of Satoshi, as anticipated, successfully completed the payments to a Lightning address. I wanted to test whether I could exchange 20,000 sats for Liquid in these conditions, just to be confident in recommending it to my followers. For the Lightning to Liquid swap I was using the Boltz.exchange website, with the Green wallet set as the recipient. I didn't attempt the swap with Blixt, Green and Zeus since their earlier payment attempts had failed. Surprisingly Mutiny failed in this swap; the payment did not go through even after I waited for two minutes. Both Phoenix and the Wallet of Satoshi successfully completed the swap from Lightning to Liquid Bitcoin. Also here the custodial Wallet of Satoshi was slower compared to the self-custodial Phoenix wallet. The differences in fees for the payments were marginal, just around 100 to 200 sats, which is negligible. The costs for sending and receiving were roughly the same across different wallets. However, the costs associated with opening a channel varied significantly. Notably, the Green wallet was the cheapest option, requiring only 3% of the transferred amount as fees. On the other hand, Zeus was the most expensive in these terms. In terms of payment reliability, Phoenix and the Wallet of Satoshi stood out as the most dependable. This isn't surprising for the Wallet of Satoshi, given its custodial nature. Following closely was Mutiny, which successfully completed three out of four payment attempts. Green, however, managed only one successful payment out of four. Phoenix showed remarkable reliability, successfully processing all four payments. I even managed to send 11 sats from my Phoenix wallet to my Alby Lightning address under very challenging conditions with a download rate of only 0.15 Mbps, upload speed of 0.05 Mbps, and a ping of 185. Phoenix stands out as the clear winner in terms of payment speed. It was even faster than the custodial Wallet of Satoshi. Green and Mutiny also show satisfactory performance, provided they functioned correctly. I evaluated the wallets' features, focusing on their user-friendliness and security aspects. How easy is it to do a backup? Is the wallet open source? How well are the wallet users guided to ensure highest security standards are applied without their actions compromising them? I focused on the backup process, particularly favoring 12-word seed phrases, because this results in acceptable security and randomness for the private keys and it's easier to store 12 words than 24. Green and Phoenix use 12-word seeds, while Blixt, Mutiny and Zeus opt for 24-word seeds. A key aspect of product design is encouraging users to adopt high-security measures seamlessly. Being forced to write down the backup while opening the wallet is one of these good design features. I call it “forced backup” and only Green offers it. All the other wallets show a call to action only. Conversely, permitting the seed phrase to be copied to the device's clipboard for convenience may compromise the security of the funds. Uninformed users and newbies might copy it, send their seed per email to themselves, store it as a screenshot or in a Word document. I have seen it all. Convenience is the enemy of security. While it's true that users should only store small amounts in a Lightning wallet, it's also a fact that users will apply the same unsafe behavior to an on-chain wallet, because why not? Blixt allows copying the seed. Mutiny and Zeus too, but they at least warn their users. Green and Zeus are doing it the right way and prevent copying the seed, aligning with best security practices. I think cloud backups on the user side are not desirable. They can be a double-edged sword, offering convenience but also presenting potential security risks and accessibility issues. Many people in African countries don't have a Google Drive or iCloud account to secure their channels. For added security, I prefer to use a PIN, password, or pattern lock to secure a Bitcoin wallet. Otherwise, for example in case a security officer at an airport or a thief wants me to open my wallet, I can be forced to use my fingerprint or my Face ID. Blixt, Mutiny, Green and Zeus offer password or PIN-based security. Phoenix provided biometric options such as face ID or fingerprint recognition only, but I hope they consider making changes to this feature. See also: Gridless Uses Bitcoin Mining to Power Rural Africa A significant feature I value is whether the wallets offer a separate on-chain Bitcoin wallet. This is a great feature as users only need to install one app for Bitcoin and Lightning. Blixt, Mutiny, Green and Zeus provide a separate on-chain Bitcoin wallet. Phoenix does not. While it allows for swapping in and out, the functionality is integrated and not separated as a distinct Bitcoin wallet. Coin control is going to be more and more important as transaction fees are rising. We need Bitcoin mobile wallets allowing us to do coin control and choose different UTXOs for a transaction. Sadly, none of the tested wallets allows that. This limitation impacts users' ability to manage transaction costs effectively. While Green does offer coin control, it's only available in their desktop version, not on mobile. A Lightning address, similar in format to an email address, is a convenient feature that allows you to receive Lightning payments asynchronously without requiring the wallet to be actively open. Blixt offers a LN address in their experimental feature called "Lightning Box." Zeus is using hodl invoices, a solution that has been criticized by a few developers because of the complexity and the fact that holding invoices could affect the performance of the Lightning Network overall. The other self-custody wallets do not offer Lightning addresses. Given this, it might be a better option to use custodial services like getalby.com or the Wallet of Satoshi for a Lightning address and to send the sats to a Bitcoin, Lightning or Liquid self-custody wallet from time to time. All the wallets allow payments to Lightning addresses. Only Phoenix offers auto channels at the moment. This means Phoenix is more convenient than other wallets, because you only have to set up one channel. The channel then dynamically adjusts its size if you send more funds to it than its liquidity allows. To keep your channel size consistent, you should not swap out to on-chain bitcoin as it reduces the size of the channel. In terms of fee settings, all wallets except Mutiny allow you to define the maximum Lightning fee you're willing to pay. This gives users some control over their payment costs. Regarding channel management, all wallets allow you to force close the channels. Additionally, Blixt, Zeus and Phoenix allow you to purchase inbound liquidity. After returning to town I tested the payments that failed a second time. I realized that Green’s experimental mode is really very experimental, because I could not send a single Lightning payment with Green and other people reported the same in the Blockstream Telegram group. Blixt was still not able to sync to the top of the blockchain and after five minutes of waiting I stopped the process. Zeus was able to sync and started the node, but then LND was taking a long time to get Zeus “ready to make payments” and after three minutes of waiting I closed the app. From my educator's perspective, my top choices are the Phoenix and Mutiny wallet. Everything works with Phoenix, you don’t need to worry about channel management and payments are even faster than with the custodial Wallet of Satoshi. The fees for payments in Phoenix might be off-putting, from that perspective one might look into Mutiny as it is convincing due to its user-friendliness, making it ideal for beginners. Mutiny’s channel opening was more expensive though and it doesn’t offer auto channels. Part of their business model is the optional Mutiny+ subscription for 16,000 sats per month. Green would be a strong recommendation, particularly for those who value additional options like Liquid and on-chain transactions in a single wallet with one seed. As long as their Lightning payments aren’t working, it’s a no-go obviously. Blixt and Zeus are more suited for advanced users due to their range of options, but they did not work in my tests. To choose the optimal wallet, it’s important to ask yourself what are the main goals and the features you’ll need. I've developed an online learning program that could help guide you in that endeavor. In summary, the evaluation of self-custodial Lightning wallets in rural Zimbabwe in 2024 revealed important insights. Wallets like Phoenix, Mutiny, Green, Zeus and Blixt were tested for their performance, reliability and user-friendliness. Opening channels with these wallets varied in cost and balance. Phoenix and the Wallet of Satoshi exhibited high reliability and speed, with Phoenix performing better than the custodial Wallet of Satoshi. From an educational standpoint, the wallets' features were assessed, emphasizing user-friendliness and security. Green and Phoenix offered user-friendly 12-word seed phrases, while Blixt, Mutiny and Zeus provided 24-word seeds. Green's "forced backup" was a notable security feature. Cloud backups raised concerns about user data security, as some wallets offered this option. App lock preferences and the availability of separate on-chain Bitcoin wallets were also considered. Phoenix topped the rankings for its overall performance and reliability, followed by Mutiny for its user-friendliness.

Binance P2P is an example of this — the platform has become a risky terrain for many P2P traders. Binance P2P scams are on the rise, with even the most experienced peer-to-peer professionals succumbing to fraudsters’ traps every so often. This guide covers every type of Binance P2P scam in detail, with real examples and concrete and foolproof steps to navigate them. Here’s how to stay safe on Binance P2P. Scams are rife in decentralized ecosystems, and the Binance P2P trading platform is not immune to such threats. The platform is designed for like-minded individuals to buy and sell Bitcoin (BTC), USDT, and other popular crypto assets directly among themselves. The centralized exchange (CEX) only acts as a facilitator; it doesn’t charge overheads and offers a simple and intuitive process for buyers and sellers alike. However, the space also plays host to a number of unscrupulous actors. In 2024, the platform is rife with individuals looking to dupe unwitting users who aim only to engage in legitimate P2P trading. An example of a suspicious request on Binance P2P: Here is a quick example of how a Binance P2P transaction is supposed to work: Throughout this guide, you will continue to encounter the A-B example to demonstrate the breadth and common themes of Binance P2P scams. If you use P2P – Please watch this video. In this video, we have discussed the Crypto Scam problem thats happening in India. Which is leading to Police enquiry & Bank Account Block. We have also discussed – The best available option to get the Bank account unblocked.… It is a common observation that most Binance P2P scams occur in developing nations. Here’s why: Here are some common Binance P2P scams you should be aware of. Scenario: A (Seller) lists an offer to sell 1 BTC for $50,000. B (Buyer) agrees to the trade and claims to have made the payment but never actually transfers the $50,000. A, believing the payment has been made, releases the BTC from the escrow service, only to realize later that the payment was never received. Actual example: In July 2023, two individuals were arrested in Ujjain, India, for running such a scam. They used counterfeit IDs and personal data to create fraudulent accounts on Binance P2P. The scammers sent fake SMS messages to sellers, mimicking bank notifications that falsely indicated the payment had been made. The unsuspecting sellers, believing the SMS notifications, release their Bitcoin (BTC) or other cryptocurrency without actually receiving the funds. The fraudsters exploited free SMS platforms to send these false messages, which resulted in significant financial losses for the victims. Beware of the consequences of crypto P2P scams: if your bank account freezes due to fraudulent activity, neither cybercrime support nor the bank will provide assistance, leaving your funds at risk. Even if you’re diligently paying crypto taxes, you’re on your own. Stay… Scenario: B (Buyer) completes the payment and receives 1 BTC from A (Seller). Later, B initiates a chargeback with the bank, reversing the $50,000 payment. A loses both the BTC and the payment. Did you know? In one reported case in Nigeria, a trader sold BTC worth approximately $5,000. The buyer made the payment using a bank transfer, and the seller, after confirming the receipt of funds, released the BTC. However, the buyer later initiated a chargeback, claiming the transaction was unauthorized. The bank reversed the transfer, and the seller lost both the BTC and the $5,000. It is not just about A and B anymore. Identity theft presents another scenario: Scenario: C (Scammer) uses a stolen identity to create a fake account and poses as either A (Seller) or B (Buyer). If C poses as A, they might disappear after B makes the payment. If C poses as B, they might scam A using fraudulent payment methods. The case of identity theft is growing in countries like India, where individuals who require funds may voluntarily sell their account info to scammers, usually Buyers, who then buy crypto from regular sellers and transfer funds. When they disappear, the person “C,” who didn’t get anything despite the promises, lodges an official complaint, and the fund tracking takes the authorities to the seller’s account. This then gets frozen, or the amount received is locked as a bank lien. A big update on crypto🇮🇳 in P2p scams: Cyber Criminal transferred money in victim account. Bank feezed victim bank account on police request. Victim cant access the account. Kerala High court to Banks: "Don't freeze the bank account only withhold disputed amount." Though not directly related to Binance, here is a real-life example of how identity theft goes down: Bryan Alan Sparks and Autumn Gail Luna used stolen identities to apply for various COVID-19 relief benefits and open bank accounts. Between March 2020 and January 2021, they used the identities of more than 50 individuals to claim approximately $1.98 million in benefits, including unemployment aid and small business loans. “In each case, scammers use common tactics. They pretend to be a trusted source, like a store or a bank. “ Scenario: B could be using illicit funds to buy BTC from A, using a P2P platform to clean the money. The idea here is simple. Scammers who have duped others try to purchase cryptocurrency from unwitting sellers, dumping the illegally procured funds in their accounts. If and when an investigation starts, it is the seller who faces the heat. In November 2023, Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) pled guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and failing to implement effective AML controls. This failure allowed money laundering activities to flourish on the platform. The Department of Justice (DOJ) found that Binance’s inadequate compliance measures facilitated illegal transactions, including those involving terrorist financing, cybercriminals, and other illicit actors. To use Binance P2P platforms safely, you should consistently follow a set of practices. This section outlines the requisite steps P2P traders must take to protect themselves. Here is a detailed thread that can help: Developing countries are seeing a rise in crypto P2P scams. This includes account-selling, SMS, and email scams. As a user, staying informed about these threats is crucial. Check this thread to #StaySafe#P2PScams #Binance #P2P #Crypto pic.twitter.com/Deo5WlnSLQ Besides the mentioned strategies, you can even connect with known users on Binance to facilitate payments. You can also: The above points represent lesser-known but solid high-level strategies to employ to avoid being scammed. If it’s already too late for protective measures, both sellers and buyers can consider legal recourse. However, while this is technically an option, it’s often a difficult path to travel. Blockchain and FinTech lawyer Pawan Laddha spoke with BeInCrypto about the practicality of utilizing legal help, particularly in countries where many aren’t aware of P2P fundamentals. “Driving the legal system for redressal in crypto P2P scam cases is an uphill battle. The lack of clear regulations and complexity of the fundamentals of peer-to-peer transactions, decentralized ledgers, and the pseudonymous nature of crypto wallets among law enforcement officials makes it incredibly challenging to seek justice. The legal status of cryptocurrencies themselves remains a gray area, with no single comprehensive legislation governing their use. Many victims find themselves trapped in a maze of account freezes and bureaucratic tangles as authorities grapple with concepts like irreversible transactions, self-custodial wallets, and the cross-border nature of blockchain networks. Unfortunately, success stories of individuals emerging victorious from such ordeals are few and far between in the current regulatory landscape.” In most cases, Binance doesn’t guarantee refunds. However, the peer-to-peer crypto exchange does work closely with law enforcement to handle scams and frauds. Also, if the scam has been initiated (willingly or unwillingly) by a Binance P2P merchant, refunds can be a potential solution. Each merchant needs to deposit at least 2000 USDT with Binance or have this amount in a funding wallet as a sign of credibility. Diving into real-life examples is one of the best ways to understand scams and the possible solutions. Here’s the experience of BeInCrypto writer Ananda Banerjee. Ananda received his January salary in crypto. In early February, he decided to off-ramp his crypto earnings — selling USD using Binance’s P2P platform. Ananda chose the Express P2P order option and was automatically matched with a buyer offering a decent price to buy USDT. After verifying that the funds came from a legitimate source and noting the buyer’s positive feedback, he completed the sale. A month later, Axis Bank, where Ananda holds his account, placed a lien on the transaction amount following a complaint from the Cyber Crime section of Gurugram, Haryana. Additionally, a similar complaint was raised from Rajkot, Gujarat. This indicated that the funds Ananda received were acquired illegally by the buyer. The complaints and the subsequent lien on Ananda’s account imply that the buyer who purchased crypto from Ananda used illicitly obtained funds. This could also be a case of identity fraud, where the verified buyer might have used someone else’s account to transfer funds. However, the situation remains unclear due to the less-than-cooperative nature of police and banking officials in India. They often do not disclose the complete report of what transaction was flagged and why it was flagged. Despite Ananda not being a trader and simply receiving his salary in crypto, police questioned how he received his funds, demonstrating a lack of understanding of international salary structures. Here is the letter Ananda received from the bank. Notice how key information isn’t disclosed: This case highlights the importance of thorough verification and cautious trading practices, even when using reputed platforms like Binance P2P. It also underscores the challenges faced by crypto users in India due to regulatory and legal ambiguities. Ananda’s scenario outline in our case study isn’t a one-off. The CryptoIndia subreddit further demonstrates the proliferation of scams on the platform across the region. Every second day, a concern is raised by those engaged in P2P trading, showcasing how precarious the situation is. But then, people are optimistic about the fix, not because the government has started to pay attention but now that Binance has agreed to adhere to the FIU guidelines. Here is what one trader had to say regarding FIU compliance: “FlU compliance itself means that you are dealing with a trusted party and the Govt can’t hold you accountable for receiving funds from a compliant counterparty. They will either remove the P2P feature or make sure it is somehow compliant. Expect more scrutiny when sending and receiving funds via the new Binance. It will definitely not be convenient, and funds might take longer to process, especially if they have doubts about the source.” While India’s P2P markets are hotbeds for scams, numerous other instances of P2P and other exchange-specific frauds have surfaced globally. Here are a few notable ones: In Nigeria, scammers frequently use fake proof of payment to deceive sellers into releasing their Bitcoin (BTC) or other cryptocurrencies. A common method involves scammers sending fake bank transfer receipts or screenshots to the seller. A seller received a fake bank notification from a scammer claiming to have transferred funds via GTBank. The seller, believing the notification to be genuine, released the BTC, only to find out later that the money was never deposited. This emphasizes the importance of verifying payment by logging into your bank account rather than trusting notifications. In Kenya, a common scam involves a man-in-the-middle attack, where the scammer intercepts communications between the buyer and seller, facilitating a fraudulent transaction. A scammer posed as both a buyer and a seller on Binance P2P. They directed a legitimate buyer to send payment to a legitimate seller while intercepting the communication. The seller, believing the payment was from the buyer, released the cryptocurrency to the scammer’s wallet. The bank involved was Equity Bank. This type of scam can be prevented by ensuring all communication is conducted within the P2P platform. In Brazil, scammers set up fake escrow services to conduct P2P transactions. These malicious actors create professional-looking websites or services that appear legitimate but are designed to steal funds. A seller agreed to use an escrow service suggested by the buyer. The service looked professional, with a well-designed website and customer support. However, after the buyer sent the payment to the fake escrow service, the seller never received the cryptocurrency, and the escrow service disappeared. Banco do Brasil was mentioned in the complaint filed by the victim. This scam underscores the importance of using only well-known and verified escrow services provided by reputable P2P platforms. In South Africa, chargeback fraud is common. Her,e scammers use reversible payment methods like credit cards to reverse payments after receiving the cryptocurrency. A seller received a payment via the First National Bank (FNB) credit card and released the cryptocurrency. A few days later, the seller was notified by the bank that the payment had been reversed due to a chargeback request from the buyer. The seller lost both the cryptocurrency and the payment, illustrating the risks associated with accepting reversible payment methods on P2P platforms. And it’s not just Binance. Other exchanges in other countries have also seen a surge in such instances. In Canada, a prevalent P2P scam involves fraudsters impersonating technical support staff from well-known cryptocurrency exchanges like NDAX or Shakepay. They contact victims through unofficial channels such as social media or messaging apps, claiming that their accounts have issues that need urgent attention. A victim received a message on Telegram from someone claiming to be NDAX support, stating there was suspicious activity on their account. The scammer asked for login credentials and remote access to their device. Once access was granted, the scammer initiated unauthorized transactions, transferring funds out of the victim’s account. This highlights the importance of only communicating through official channels and never sharing login details. If you want to try out other P2P platforms, here are some of the Binance alternatives or, rather, Binance competitors to consider: In addition to the mentioned names, you can also use other platforms, including Bisq and Paxful, to buy and sell crypto among peers. If buyers and sellers remain vigilant, scammers may begin to realize that operating successfully on this platform is no longer feasible. However, even with the strongest crypto security standards, crypto scams aren’t expected to end anytime soon. Opportunists and bad actors will likely always operate within emerging and decentralized ecosystems. To combat these threats, the focus should be on improving the quality of issue handling and legal avenues offered to those who fall victim to scammers, plus improving education and awareness around platform risk. Information is key. By being aware of the Binance P2P scams listed in this guide, users can take the necessary steps to protect themselves and their crypto assets when trading on the platform. To avoid crypto scams regarding Binance P2P buying and Binance P2P selling, you need to verify the payments, use the Binance P2P trading escrow service, communicate clearly with the other party, and even verify the counterparty details. Also, do not give out personal details or refrain from accepting third-party payments from buyers you are looking to sell Bitcoin (BTC) to. While Binance P2P offers various advantages, such as zero trading fees and a robust escrow service, it also has some issues. Despite security measures, Binance p2p scams like payment fraud, chargeback fraud, and identity theft can occur. Scammers may use fake payment proofs or stolen identities to defraud users. Users in certain regions may also face additional scrutiny from banks and regulatory bodies, which can lead to account freezes and legal complications. The reliance on a centralized escrow system means that Binance holds the funds during transactions. While this reduces scam risks, it also means users must trust Binance with their funds, which some may view as a drawback in the decentralized world of cryptocurrency. No, transactions on Binance P2P are not tax-free. The tax implications of trading on Binance P2P depend on your country’s tax laws and regulations regarding cryptocurrency transactions: If you are making a profit from Binance p2p trading, it is generally considered taxable income. This includes profits from buying and selling crypto such as BTC and USDT. In many jurisdictions, cryptocurrency transactions are subject to capital gains tax. This applies to the difference in value when you buy crypto at a lower price and sell crypto at a higher price. Countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, and India require individuals to report their cryptocurrency transactions and pay taxes accordingly. Failure to do so can result in penalties.

142::https://blockworks.co/news/algorand-fork-voi-blockchain::Blockworks::article::Algorand fork Voi tries a blockchain reboot::The self-declared “community-powered blockchain” testing a new network based on Algrorand tech.::Exclusive: The self-declared “community-powered blockchain” testing a new network based on Algrorand tech Maurice NORBERT/Shutterstock, modified by Blockworks Veteran members of the Algorand proof-of-stake blockchain ecosystem have banded together to launch a new iteration of the open-source code, called Voi, which is currently in testnet. Leading the new project is Chris Swenor, co-founder of both Reach, a blockchain development platform and the Algorand decentralized exchange (DEX) HumbleSwap. Work on Voi began in 2022, with a premise that the blockchain should better align incentives with its community of developers and users, and motivated by Swenor’s frustration with perceived shortcomings within the crypto industry. “I looked around and I was so frustrated that I saw that [venture capitalists] and the early builders owned over 90% of all tokens, and the people that are actually still there during the bear market really didn’t own the chain, but they’re still there pouring their heart into it,” Swenor told Blockworks. Voi is only forking the Algorand code, but not the chain’s state. So, unlike the failed EthPoW fork of Ethereum, for instance, Voi will have its own crypto token, but one with no connection to ownership of ALGO. In software development, a repository fork is essentially a copy of a repository that allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. That’s what’s happening here, in contrast to an Algorand blockchain fork, which is not possible. Algorand has struggled to attract users in recent years. Its seven-day dex volume, for example, is currently less than $10 million, according to DeFi Llama, placing it 38th by that metric. Read more: Closure of largest DeFi destination underscores Algorand’s struggles Swenor’s critique is not specifically of Algorand or its development stewards Algorand Technologies and the Algorand Foundation, with which he said he maintains good relations. Blockworks reached out to both Algorand entities to learn more. As a long time developer within the Algorand tech stack, Swenor said it was natural to remain focused on the Algorand consensus engine. “The thing that was very clear is that the Algorand tech is literally the best tech that we’ve ever worked with, as far as speed and what it can deliver,” he said. One of the chief differences is that Voi’s developers have earmarked 75% of its entire market cap for “ecosystem growth.” That includes node runners, and the testnet has attracted nearly 500 nodes according to its explorer, though it’s not apparent how many of those are independently operated. “This means that a very small percentage of the overall network [token] is earmarked for operations and the core team,” Swenor said. Voi intends to concentrate on a smaller vertical of applications as part of its go-to-market strategy, emphasizing “membership infrastructure,” in contrast to Algorand’s institutional focus. But Swenor also expects to contribute to Algorand development by bringing in developers, and improving tooling such as wallet and node software. The new network counts original Algorand investor Arrington Capital among its seed investors along with Sonic Boom Ventures, founded by former Algorand, Inc. CEO Steven Kokinos, who sees it as complementary to Algorand. “I think what is exciting about Voi in particular is that they’ve done a lot of work to be able to connect Voi back to the Algorand mainnet and be able to exchange assets using tech like state proofs that was built into Algorand for that express purpose,” Kokinos told Blockworks. The remaining Algorand team was initially skeptical of Voi, Swenor said, but that changed over time. They’re seeing now that this is actually beneficial for Algorand as a whole…because we’re kind of at different missions and we’re going after different things, I don’t see them seeing it as a threat by any means,” he said.

China is on the list of nations crafting their own CBDCs – essentially digital money made by central banks. Though, it’s still early days for its mainstream use. At the moment, CBDCs are viewed mainly as the digital equivalent of physical cash. However, Lu Lei from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) shared in a forum that, thanks to its adaptable features, central banks might evolve CBDCs to act like M2 money, encompassing certain deposits and savings. To clarify, CBDC’s programmable aspects mean its settings can be tweaked. Imagine digital money that could expire or be set aside just for specific purchases. Lu anticipates the People’s Bank of China might look into these features to modify CBDC rates, which might then be leveraged to guide the broader economy. He also highlighted how CBDC-based international payments could make transactions more secure, easy, and inclusive. It’s worth noting that last year, Chinese banks joined a cross-border transaction trial led by the Bank of International Settlements. By the end of June, transactions using China’s digital currency, named e-CNY, reached about 1.8 trillion yuan (roughly $249.33 billion). However, the e-CNY available only represented a tiny fraction (0.16%) of China’s overall physical cash supply. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

144::https://cryptobriefing.com/crypto-talent-grants-nibiru/::Crypto Briefing::article::Nibiru COO highlights grants as a magnet for TradFi talent in crypto::Jonathan Chang shares his transition from the traditional market to crypto, and what skills were valuable when pivoting.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article The presence of crypto among institutional investors is on the rise, especially after the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US. Companies such as JPMorgan, UBS, and Wells Fargo declared Bitcoin ETF holdings in their recent 13F filings. This rise in institutional interest can also be seen in the professional area. Executives with backgrounds in traditional finance (TradFi) are rotating to crypto as the market matures. Former Credit Suisse and JPMorgan Jonathan Chang, is one of these executives, now in the role of COO at layer-1 blockchain Nibiru. He shared insights with Crypto Briefing on valuable TradFi skills that can be used in crypto, how grants are a powerful tool to attract more of the traditional market, and how those professionals can help solve crypto issues. Crypto Briefing – What was your biggest challenge when pivoting from traditional finance to crypto? What set of skills learned from TradFi were most valuable when joining this new market? Jonathan Chang – Crypto is known for its unique complexities. Traditional Finance (TradFi) offers a more relatable framework for understanding decentralized finance due to its familiar concepts. However, there is still a learning curve, particularly with the specialized terminology used in crypto. For instance, while the principles of lending, including borrowers, underwriting, credit assessment, and lenders are well-established in TradFi, the application of these concepts in crypto—built on smart contract platforms and enhanced with tokenomics—introduces a new layer of complexity. In fintech, the ledger is fundamental for recording bank transactions. This concept closely parallels the blockchain ledger used in crypto, which also records transactions but does so in a decentralized way. I’ve noticed that fintech and crypto startups often share similar goals, particularly in speeding up payments and financial services. The main difference lies in the technology stacks each uses to achieve these goals. Now that I’m more involved in crypto, my background in traditional finance is proving beneficial. My experience in equity research enhanced my analytical and writing skills, and deepened my understanding of how markets moved. In investment banking, I refined my abilities in structuring transactions, managing teams, and general soft skills. Venture capital and growth equity offered opportunities to meet diverse founders, understand market mapping, and appreciate business differentiation. These skills were invaluable, aiding in process management, quality control, and leveraging a broad network in new environments. Often, creative problem-solving is essential, and having a variety of experiences from high-pressure situations has become increasingly valuable. These reference points from my past work are helpful tools in navigating and innovating within crypto. Crypto Briefing – Are grants a valuable way to attract talent to crypto? Do you think of grants as just a money incentive, or do you think of a proper introduction to the market and its technologies? Jonathan Chang – Grants play a crucial role in drawing talent to the crypto and DeFi sectors, providing much more than just financial incentives. In a time when funding is limited and developers and entrepreneurs urgently need resources to bring their ideas to life, grants offer vital early support. Equally important, however, is the comprehensive ecosystem support that a well-designed grant program provides. This includes access to mentorship, technical resources, and a network of like-minded innovators, fostering an environment ripe for learning, experimentation, and growth. At Nibiru, our grant program is crafted to achieve these goals. We offer financial assistance and leverage our extensive network and expertise to enhance our grantees’ success. This support includes connecting them with VC partners, offering mentorship opportunities, and providing access to our advanced developer suite. Our objective is to give a complete introduction to the market and the tools needed to succeed. The Nibiru ecosystem is dedicated to empowering developers, helping them become catalysts for positive Web3 transformation. Our grants initiative not only supports through partnerships and mentorship but also boosts the visibility of projects within our ecosystem with targeted marketing support. Our grants are structured with Total Value Locked (TVL) milestones in mind, aiming to find partners committed to long-term growth within the chain. During our diligence process, the chemistry between the founder and our team is a key factor in ensuring aligned goals and collaborative potential. Crypto Briefing – Despite being better, crypto UX is still a threshold to capture more users and talent. Do you believe that non-native crypto talent’s point of view is an important piece to solve this problem? Jonathan Chang – Absolutely. A major challenge in the crypto industry today is the complexity of the user experience. Despite significant innovation, many blockchain applications remain too complex for the average user. This is where non-native crypto talent becomes crucial. These individuals may not possess deep technical knowledge of blockchain but offer fresh perspectives and a strong focus on user-centric design. They are key to bridging the gap between sophisticated technology and the seamless, user-friendly experiences that people expect. At Nibiru, we see this in action. Our team, drawn from a mix of backgrounds, including traditional finance, technology, and consumer industries, brings diverse viewpoints that are critical in developing relatable products. They challenge us to simplify and humanize our offerings, urging us to prioritize the user journey over technical details. As a result, they help us create not just functional but genuinely enjoyable experiences. So, to directly answer your question—yes, I firmly believe that non-native crypto talent is essential in addressing the UX challenges in crypto.

145::https://theconversation.com/how-blockchain-technology-is-about-to-transform-sharemarket-trading-53807::The Conversation::article::How blockchain technology is about to transform sharemarket trading::Blockchain technology has the potential to make share trading faster, more efficient and more transparent.::Recently the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) bought a $15 million stake in Digital Asset Holdings, a developer of blockchain technology. One of the main reasons is to upgrade its share registry system by using blockchain or distributed ledger technology. And it’s been reported that JP Morgan Chase is also partnering with Digital Asset Holdings to trial the technology. Put simply, blockchain technology is a method of recording and confirming transactions where instead of a centralised platform, participants each hold a complete record of transactions through peer to peer verification of transactions. This means there is no central recording system, rather each participant keeps a record of all transactions ever made. This is the same system which allows Bitcoin to operate with no central body. Instead of the ASX clearing house settling trades, trades will be settled by participants confirming transactions through the peer to peer network. The network (likely made up of brokers) will record the buyer and selling participants, the number of shares traded, price of shares, time of exchange and the exchange of funds. The ASX will still provide a centralised electronic exchange for participants to place orders, only the settlement or back office function will be sourced to the network. Blockchain has great potential to cut inefficiencies in the share settlement function. As trades are settled by peer confirmation, there is no need for a clearing house, auditors to verify trades and custodians to ensure a fund has the shares they say they hold. Essentially this is cutting out the middleman in the back office which means less costs in record keeping and in turn less costs to trading on the ASX. Given the high costs in getting a third party to audit, record keep and/or verify trades these costs are substantial. The peer confirmation of trades also means settlement can be almost instantaneous. Compare this to the current settlement period of three working days (‘T+3’) as the ASX needs to make sure the participants have the money and shares on hand to exchange. This would make shares a far more liquid investment – almost as good as having cash on hand. Higher liquidity means more investment into ASX shares. As all participants have the full record of transactions and therefore holdings of investors there is complete transparency in the equity market. This makes it almost impossible to falsify transactions or to alter prior transactions. If a false trade occurs, participants will find inconsistencies in their full ledger and reject the trade. For example an investor would be unable to sell stock that they did not own as all participants would know exactly how much stock the investor owns now. First, implementing a clearing system using blockchain will introduce a new type of fee. In the Bitcoin blockchain, miners process Bitcoin transactions by solving optimisation problems and get rewarded by newly created Bitcoins and settlement fees offered by Bitcoin users who wish to have their transactions processed. Miners prioritise the order of transactions to be cleared based on the fees offered and the difficulty of the problems to record the transaction in a block. This is what allows a blockchain to have no centralised clearing house. If the ASX blockchain requires investors to include transaction fees in order for their transactions to be cleared, then the ASX is transferring the cost of maintaining the back office to the investors. If this is to happen, investors will have to compete against each other to have their transactions cleared faster than those of others. Alternatively, if the new system doesn’t allow such fees and relies on brokers or other entities to clear the transactions, then the ASX is again transferring the cost of maintaining back office to those entities. The second concern is increased transparency. Under the proposed trading system, most of positions of the market participants could be exposed to the public as the trading ID can be identified. This could disadvantage many investors such as super, managed and hedge funds. For example, a super fund typically sells a large position on a gradual basis for a prolonged time period. In this process, it is critical not to be noticed by other traders who may take advantage of such large-scale sales. With complete transparency such as in blockchain, such a sell-off could not be applied effectively. Potentially this may make investors leave the ASX and seek more opaque venues to trade such as dark pools. Clearly a direct adoption of blockchain from Bitcoin technology would not be viable for the ASX. If the ASX is able to adopt blockchain technology and address privacy, security and trade transparency concerns then this would yield great cost savings to investors.::2016-02-03T19:05:23Z::Bitcoin, Blockchain::Adrian Lee::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/110096/original/image-20160203-28574-vitsfl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C923%2C5184%2C2514&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
146::https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-are-crypto-otc-desks-and-how-do-they-work/::CoinDesk::article::What Are Crypto OTC Desks And How Do They Work?::Cryptocurrency OTC desks play an essential role in facilitating large cryptocurrency trades in the global crypto markets. What Are Crypto OTC Desks? How Do Cryptocurrency OTC Desks Work? Why Are OTC Desks Important in Crypto? Pros and Cons of Using OTC Desks in Crypto The Bottom Line::Crypto OTC desks play an important role in facilitating large cryptocurrency purchases and sales. Read on to learn what crypto OTC desks are, how they work, and why they play an essential role in the global crypto markets. This is partner content sourced from Laura Shin’s Unchained and published by CoinDesk. Over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks facilitate trading between two parties without revealing information about the trade to the public via an exchange orderbook or otherwise. The OTC desk acts as a matchmaker enabling high-volume transactions between buyers and sellers. During an OTC trade, the two parties agree on a purchase price before they can complete the transaction. The trades can be crypto-to-crypto or fiat-to-crypto. OTC desks differ from traditional exchanges in terms of transaction transparency. A crypto exchange like Kraken or Binance acts as an intermediary between buyers and sellers. Transactions are executed via an orderbook for everyone to see. Conversely, crypto OTC trading is relatively opaque since no one beyond the transacting parties is aware of the price and volume of assets being traded. Moreover, OTC trades are typically insulated from wider market fluctuations that occur on exchanges. There are two types of OTC desks: principal and agency. Principal desks assume the risk to the buyer by using their funds to purchase whatever asset the buyer requires. For instance, a bitcoin whale looking to make a large bitcoin purchase will request a quote from the OTC desk, and they will respond with a price based on prevailing market conditions. The buyer can choose to accept the offer or make a reasonable counter. Should the buyer accept the proposed price, the OTC desk is responsible for sourcing and delivering the BTC to the buyer as per the legal contract signed beforehand. Agency desks, on the other hand, don’t assume the market risk since they don’t put up their own money for transactions. Instead, they act as an intermediary to broker a deal on behalf of the buyer. They will charge a brokerage fee for this service. Crypto OTC desks exist to enable large investors, such as early adopters, high-net-worth individuals, and institutional investors, to buy and sell large amounts of cryptocurrencies without alerting the market about their intention or transaction. If you try to buy 1,000 BTC on a regular crypto exchange, you will run into several problems. A key challenge is that the chances of finding someone selling that amount at any given time on a single exchange are slim. You will have to opt to spread the purchases across several sellers. The problem that arises is you may end up making some of the purchases at a significantly higher price. Of course, you may be able to avoid this altogether and spread the purchase across several exchanges, but this will be time-consuming and costly. Moreover, you will show the entire market that you are a large buyer or seller, which will most likely lead to a worse execution price. Crypto OTC desks remove the uncertainty and risk for investors looking to buy or sell large volumes of crypto. Here are some of the benefits and challenges of using crypto OTC desks. Large crypto investors looking to buy and sell substantial volumes of cryptocurrency prefer the crypto OTC market over trading on crypto exchanges. Most whales keep their transactions off exchange order books to avoid the market moving against them when they want to transact.

Bitcoin [BTC] network fees have fallen to a record low as the Layer 1 (L1) transaction volume continues to decline. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), on-chain data provider IntoTheBlock noted that transaction fees on the Bitcoin network plunged to their lowest level in three months this week. Recording a weekly transaction fee totaling $12 million, the network saw a 45% decline from the previous week.  This week’s decline in the Bitcoin network’s fee is due to the decrease in its transaction volume. According to Santiment’s data, the aggregate amount of BTC across all transactions completed on the network fell steadily during the week. Between the 11th and the 17th of May, Bitcoin’s transaction volume plummeted by 5%. Source: Santiment The average fee paid per transaction dropped as the network saw a decline in demand. According to Messari, this decreased by 17% during the period under review. At press time, the average cost of executing a transaction on the Bitcoin network was $2.56. The miners on Bitcoin’s network are the primary victims of its low network fees. After the percentage of miner revenue derived from transaction fees rallied to a year-to-date high of 75% on the 20th of April, post-halving event, it has since declined significantly. Source: Messari As of this writing, only 4% of miner revenue is derived from the fees paid by Bitcoin’s users. This marked a 95% decline from the YTD high, per Messari’s data. Low revenue and BTC’s recent price troubles have forced some miners to sell their holdings. AMBCrypto assessed Bitcoin’s Miner Supply Ratio and found that it has fallen by 0.21% since the halving event. This metric measures miners’ BTC holdings relative to the coin’s total supply. When it declines this way, miners are selling a larger portion of their mined coins. This is often due to capitulation from high operational costs, the desire to take profit, or a lack of confidence in the coin’s price. Is your portfolio green?

Yet, developers looking to Ethereum to build usable web3 resources do not simply start building on the mainnet. Instead, they rely first on testnets. This guide discusses one popular testnet, Rinkeby. Read on to learn about this vital Ethereum test network. Testnets are used to support test transactions. Developers user testnets to try out implementations that use frameworks such as Truffle and the Solidity programming language. This allows DApps to be tested and improved without developers encountering the financial burden and risks associated with the main Ethereum blockchain. Rinkeby is one such testnet. Even though the Rinkeby testnet and Rinkeby faucet were deprecated as of 2024, assessing their role in facilitating robust DApp development can help both new and advanced developers better understand Ethereum test networks. The Rinkeby testnet for Ethereum DApp testing came into existence in 2017. It focused specifically on smart contract testing and quickly became vital to the Ethereum development environment. Rinkeby operated as a proof-of-authority (PoA) testnet at a time when Ethereum itself was proof-of-work (PoW), as was Ropsten, one of the other popular testnets. BREAKING: Ethereum's testnet Ropsten successfully transitions to PoS Over the years, the Rinkeby network emerged as a particularly stable option. The network offered something similar to a “Controlled Node Validation” environment and supported predictable testing scenarios. The Rinkeby testnet community quickly became one of the most active, offering reliable and quick feedback on smart contract execution. Meanwhile, the PoA consensus ensured the testnet became one of the best for developers looking to continuously test setups and integrations. Did you know? Controlled Node Validation, in the case of Rinkeby testnet, refers to a system where only a limited number of entities (trusted) are allowed to confirm and validate transactions. Rinkeby was one of the more popular Ethereum test networks used to quickly test smart contracts and DApps. The Rinkeby testnet was a controlled sandbox-like environment replicating the Ethereum blockchain environment. Developers could deploy applications on this testnet before introducing them to the mainnet. As for the testnet gas fees, some faucets gave out made-up ETH or “test” ETH. Rinkeby Faucet was one such test ETH tap, associated specifically with the Rinkeby testnet. Trusted node operation was another technical aspect of the now-defunct Rinkeby testnet. Just like the mainnet, where validators have both block-creation and transaction-confirming power, in the case of Rinkeby, this was handled by trusted entities or individuals operating the nodes. As mentioned previously, the Rinkeby faucet employed the PoA consensus mechanism, which supports faster transactions and, therefore, quicker tests. Only validated accounts approve the blocks and transactions, which made the testnet more secure than other options. As PoA facilitates speed and efficiency, Rinkeby became an obvious choice for developers looking for quick iterations and feedback. When active, Rinkeby was extensively compared to the likes of Kovan and Ropsten. Kovan followed the same PoA consensus as Rinkeby. However, Rinkeby was more popular as it was supported by Geth, Ethereum’s most popular client. Ropsten resembled Ethereum closely as it was a PoW testnet, much like Ethereum before 2022. However, Ropsten often encountered issues due to spamming and forking, making Rinkeby all the more popular. New testnets surfaced for Ethereum since the merge. Kiln (now also deprecated) was one example. Kiln, the next iteration of Ethereum merge testnets, is now live 🔥🧱 Highly recommended that node operators, application developers, stakers, tooling/infra providers test their setups on the network. Blog post has all the info to get started 😁https://t.co/TCHBZxcFlt Simply put, the Rinkeby faucet is like a tap that distributes test ETH, allowing developers to test DApps repeatedly without worrying about gas fees. The Rinkeby faucet provides test ETH when you connect your Ethereum wallet address or MetaMask wallet address to the faucet website. Once done, you can redirect the faucet tokens to your MetaMask address, provided you have selected the testnet network. Even though Rinkeby isn’t available in 2024, you can try this process with Sepolia. In some cases, testnet ETH caps are used to avoid network abuse. “Testnets help three distinct groups of users: client developers, application developers and node operators/stakers/miners, but, the needs of each of these are quite different!” Notably, with faucets like Rinkeby’s, the DApp and DeFi development cycle becomes cost-effective. This is because developers have time to perfect their resources before launching them on the mainnet. Here are a few specific Rinkeby testnet features that made it different from other faucets: Rinkeby transactions were publicly available, like Ethereum, via a dedicated explorer. This tool, termed Rinkeby Etherscan, was useful for the following tasks: Now that the Rinkeby testnet is no longer available, users can only access Rinkeby Etherscan as an archived tool. The Arbiscan Rinkeby Testnet explorer by @etherscan is now live! 🎊 Navigate through all of your activity on our testnet with this beautiful new explorer! 🔎 👉 https://t.co/XM1HeoZ1Gw pic.twitter.com/1gE4h7lLLV Clarity around node setup and maintenance of the popular testnet should help set up and maintain future iterations. Here are the things you should note about the Rinkeby testnet: Here is a quick table comparing the Rinkeby testnet with some of the other popular names (all deprecated): The Rinkeby testnet and faucet are no longer active. While the Ethereum Foundation discontinued their use in 2023, the testnet and faucet were officially deprecated on June 15, 2022. Here’s why: BREAKING: #Ethereum Goerli testnet successfully merges to proof-of-stake. With Rinkeby out of the equation, Sepolia is the only Ethereum test network in play in 2024. This testnet serves as a reliable alternative, thanks to its PoS consensus. This precisely checks security enhancements, validator performance, and staking. While the Rinkeby Ethereum network and the Rinkeby faucet are no longer active, the importance of testnets in the Ethereum development environment cannot be overstated. From launching a cryptocurrency on Ethereum to exploring innovative DeFi use cases or DApp testing, testnets are lifelines for developers and crucial to successful blockchain development. You cannot use the Rinkeby Ethereum network anymore in 2024. However, when it was active, it was used for Ethereum DApp testing, smart contract testing, and for other use cases across the Ethereum development environment. A testnet faucet like the Rinkeby faucet is a tool or service distributing free test cryptocurrency, including test ETH to the testnet users. The faucet for testing Ether is takes care of the testnet gas fees for developers interested in Ethereum test transactions. ETH is the actual cryptocurrency specific to the Ethereum blockchain. Goerli ETH, on the other hand, is the testnet faucet ETH that doesn’t have any real-world value and is simply made-up Ethereum. However, Goerli ETH once traded at a premium due to massive demand, an issue that was combatted using testnet caps. A testnet is meant for testing real DApps before they are deployed to the mainnet. For instance, developers indulging in Rinkeby testnet deployment focused on testing smart contracts and DApps on the Rinkeby Ethereum network first, using testnet gas fees to check stability, security posture, and other aspects.

149::https://blockworks.co/news/future-tokenization-permissioned-blockchains::Blockworks::article::The future of tokenization? Permissioned blockchains::Opinion: Despite BlackRock’s fund on Ethereum, the future of tokenization is really with permissioned blockchains.::At least for the near future, the majority of institutional tokenization will take place on closed, permissioned networks Artwork by Crystal Le Many interpret BlackRock pouring $100 million into Ethereum as a sign that institutional tokenization will finally take off on public, permissionless networks. It will — but BlackRock’s tokenized fund is only melting the tip of a Titanic-sized iceberg. The crypto industry has cried wolf about institutions coming many times. By this point, we definitely know they’re interested in tokenization. The big players — BNP Paribas, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, the Hong Kong government, Franklin Templeton, Hamilton Lane and now BlackRock — have already been exploring blockchain technology for a while. It’s certainly a watershed moment when the world’s largest asset manager opts for a public chain over a private platform like JPMorgan’s Onyx or Goldman Sach’s solution. BlackRock’s tokenized fund on Ethereum signals institutional trust in a public, permissionless network, bringing much-needed legitimacy to the nascent public ecosystem. The move will also encourage other traditional institutional players to transition to on-chain funds. But while BlackRock’s tokenization on Ethereum was a bold move worthy of the headlines it made, the reality is tokenization is predominantly taking place on private, permissioned blockchains. To date, the majority of institutional efforts have involved private networks. The Hong Kong government’s $100 million tokenized green bond used GS DAP, deployed on the privacy-enabled blockchain Canton. Goldman Sachs, BNY Mellon, Cboe Global Markets and other firms recently wrapped up a series of pilots on the same network. HSBC has used its platform, the Orion digital assets platform, to tokenize gold for everyday investors in Hong Kong. And BlackRock has used the private Tokenized Collateral Network on JPMorgan’s Ethereum-based Onyx to tokenize shares in one of its money market funds. Read more from our opinion section: Fintech has hit a wall. Blockchain will break through it. Bitcoin proved that a multi-billion dollar market can essentially come out of thin air. The industry believed that everything could be tokenized and traded via blockchain and enjoy increased liquidity. However, the glittering promise of liquidity for real-world assets has (so far) proven a mirage. The initial token boom of 2018 hyped trillions of dollars in tokenized assets on public networks. Almost seven years later, there are only a few billions of dollars in total assets under management on public networks — a tiny piece of what’s theoretically possible. Meanwhile, private networks are moving billions of dollars in daily transactions. The crypto industry loves to float the $16 trillion in illiquid assets Boston Consulting Group projects to be tokenized by 2030. Even the more conservative estimate — McKinsey & Company’s $5 trillion in tokenized real-world assets — is huge. If we look at the trends and what’s happening, though, it’s clear that a majority of these assets will first be tokenized on private networks. Unlike crypto — which is an entirely new asset class existing within open ecosystems — real-world assets inherit the legacy of traditional finance. This legacy favors control over assets and customers, closed ecosystems and compatibility with traditional markets — a direct contrast with the ethos of public, permissionless networks. This explains why financial institutions favor private networks. Private networks operate closer to the existing financial infrastructure and can facilitate easier compliance. These networks are more capable of meeting business needs, as they provide flexibility in governance and customization, like modifications to the blockchain’s consensus protocol, transaction validation rules and permissions. These networks can also handle higher transaction volumes, which is essential for scalability. There’s also the issue of regulation. It’s only in the past couple of years that regulators have begun to pass and enact comprehensive frameworks guiding involvement in crypto assets. As a result, public blockchain technology has felt untouchable until recently to these institutions, for whom compliance is paramount. For securities, there is at least some clarity. Tokenized securities are still securities and must operate within the existing regulatory framework. However, some assets — like real estate — which are not necessarily securities off chain will be considered securities once tokenized. The industry is still figuring out what it would take for these assets to meet existing requirements. Today, nobody doubts the benefits of blockchain technology. The issue for traditional finance is mostly one of integration and technology costs, infrastructure compatibility and regulatory concerns. While public networks offer more transparency, immutability and decentralization, private networks are more practical and familiar for financial institutions. There are also a few technology issues to sort out. Let’s use BlackRock’s chosen Ethereum as an example. While Ethereum has made progress with initiatives like layer-2 solutions and the Merge to Ethereum 2.0, the network faces challenges meeting the demand for speed, privacy and compliance necessary for transactions involving regulated institutions. As the technology matures and regulatory frameworks evolve, we can expect to see more tokenization migrating to public blockchains and a new wave of innovation. However, at least for the near future, the majority of institutional tokenization will take place on closed, permissioned networks.

151::https://cryptobriefing.com/us-bitcoin-etf-inflows-2/::Crypto Briefing::article::Bitcoin ETFs show $1.3 billion inflows and bounce back from April's slump::Bitcoin ETFs in US now manage over $12.3 billion, despite regulatory challenges. Regulatory movements::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US registered $1.3 billion in inflows over the past two weeks, shared Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas on X. This was enough to recover completely from April’s net outflows of over $343 million. The Bitcoin ETFs traded in the US now hold more than $12.3 billion under management, which Balchunas considers a key number for considering inflows and outflows. The bitcoin ETFs have put together a solid two weeks with $1.3b in inflows, which offsets the entirety of the negative flows in April- putting them back around high water mark of +$12.3b net since launch. This key number IMO bc it nets out inflows and outflows (which are normal) pic.twitter.com/tdnZOKEocM — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) May 17, 2024 Moreover, Balchunas highlighted that those numbers make a point of not getting “emotional” over Bitcoin ETF flows, sharing his belief that the net flows will turn out as positive in the long term and that the flow amounts are relatively small when compared to the total under management. As reported by Crypto Briefing, professional investment firms showed a high interest in Bitcoin ETFs in the first quarter, with 937 of them reporting exposure to those investment instruments in their 13F Forms. Balchunas doubled down on that, highlighting that BlackRock’s IBIT got 414 reported holders in Q1. He adds that having 20 holders for a recently launched ETF is “highly rare,” showing that at least four Bitcoin funds surpassed that mark with ease. In the last 24 hours, nine Bitcoin ETFs in the US added 3,743 BTC to their holdings, as reported by X user Lookonchain, which is equivalent to over $250 million. Grayscale’s GBTC added 397 BTC, while BlackRock’s IBIT added 1,435 BTC. Galaxy’s BTCO was the only Bitcoin ETF showing daily net outflows, with 543 BTC leaving their chest. Furthermore, recent regulatory developments in the US could heat up even more the Bitcoin ETF landscape. Yesterday, the Senate passed a vote to overturn the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121), which makes it more expensive for banks to hold digital assets for their customers. However, US President Joe Biden has already manifested himself contrary to the bill, and a presidential veto is very likely.

152::https://theconversation.com/are-nfts-really-dead-and-buried-all-signs-point-to-yes-214145::The Conversation::article::Are NFTs really dead and buried? All signs point to ‘yes’::This is why no one is buying your cartoon ape.::Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are in dire straits. With the market in a severe downturn, it’s safe to assume the NFT bubble has well and truly burst. It was never clear why these digital collectables traded for such large amounts of money. Now they mostly do not. What’s behind their turn of fate? And is there any hope for their future? Non-fungible tokens are a blockchain-based means to claim unique “ownership” of digital assets. “Non-fungible” means unique, as opposed to a “fungible” item such as a five-dollar bill, which is the same as every other five-dollar bill. But just because an item is unique that doesn’t make it valuable. Digital assets are easily copied, so an NFT is essentially a receipt showing you have paid for something that other people can get for free. This is a pretty dubious basis for value. The two most traded sets of NFTs are the Bored Apes collection created in April 2021 and the CryptoPunks collection launched in June 2017. Both sets consist of 10,000 similar-looking but unique figures, distinguished by differing hairstyles, hats, skin colours and so forth. The Bored Ape character seems derivative of the drawings of Jamie Hewlett, the artist who drew Tank Girl and Damon Albarn’s virtual band Gorillaz. The CryptoPunks are even less interesting. Although the first NFTs emerged around a decade ago, the trend really started to take off in 2021. And for a time NFTs were very fashionable. Even the venerable auction house Sotheby’s, founded in 1744, jumped on the NFT bandwagon. Sotheby’s sold 101 Bored Ape NFTs for more than US$20 million in September 2021. They’re now facing a lawsuit from a disgruntled buyer. As with Bitcoin and similar speculative tokens, the primary driver for buying NFTs was greed. Seeing the initial price rises, people hoped they too could make huge profits. NFTs are essentially a superficially sophisticated form of gambling. Like Bitcoin, they have no fundamental value. Read more: NFTs, an overblown speculative bubble inflated by pop culture and crypto mania Generally, one would only profit from buying an NFT by finding a “greater fool” willing to pay even more for it. So there was never a shortage of people – including some quite famous ones – talking them up and hoping to instil a fear of missing out. Eminem bought a Bored Ape that looked a bit like him. Rapper KSI boasted on Twitter about his Bored Ape rising in price. For a while there were large increases in the prices of many NFTs. But like all speculative bubbles, it was likely to end in tears. Although it’s almost impossible to predict when a bubble for a speculative asset will burst, we have seen this process play out before. Centuries ago there were the Dutch tulip, South Sea and Mississippi bubbles. Around 1970, there was a speculative bubble in the shares of nickel miner Poseidon. Then came the Beanie Baby and dotcom booms of the late 1990s – and more recently, meme stocks and Terra-Luna cryptocurrency. Punters now seem to be as bored with NFTs as the apes. Google searches for “NFT” – which grew rapidly through 2021 – have fallen away dramatically. Trading volumes have collapsed. Prices in the NFT market have also seen huge falls. The prices of Bored Ape NFTs are down about 90% from their peak. The CryptoPunks have done slightly better by losing only 80%. A recent report covering about 73,000 NFTs estimated 70,000 are now valued at zero. This leaves 23 million people holding a worthless “asset”. One high-profile example is an NFT of the first tweet by then-Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Crypto entrepreneur Sina Estavi bought this NFT for US$2.9 million in March 2021. When he tried to sell it a year later the top bid was US$6,800. What drove the NFT collapse? As well as losing their novelty, the market was hurt by the large falls in the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency, as well as the collapse of the FTX exchange and publicity given to scams. Beyond that, the lifting of COVID lockdowns meant people who began trading NFTs now had other ways to pass their time. And higher interest rates from mid-2022 made most speculative assets seem less attractive. Collectively, all of these factors made NFTs seem like a riskier proposition. Prominent people started jumping off the bandwagon. Some of KSI’s later tweets lament the losses he suffered from his gambles.  Last year, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced, when he was chancellor of the exchequer (their equivalent of treasurer), the Royal Mint would produce an NFT. The plan has now been abandoned. Some foolish people had even taken out loans using the “value” of their NFTs as collateral. When the lenders wanted the money back, they were in trouble: forced to sell their NFTs, they got back much less than they’d paid. Fortunately, there weren’t enough people like this to lead to a systemic problem in the financial sector.

Tulips are still grown in the Netherlands. Poseidon shares, which ran up from 80 cents in September 1969 to $280 in February 1970, are still listed (and currently trading for 2 cents). But unless some actual use is found for them, NFTs are likely to fade further from public discussion, with their prices increasingly trending down (although the occasional blip up may give die-hard fans some hope). They will probably join the Dutch tulips and dotcoms in the history of speculative follies. Read more: Almost no one uses Bitcoin as currency, new data proves.

153::https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/08/microstrategy-should-continue-to-rally-as-bitcoin-halving-nears-benchmark/::CoinDesk::article::MicroStrategy Should Continue to Rally as Bitcoin Halving Nears: Benchmark::The broker raised its price target for the software company to $1,875 from $990 and maintained its buy rating on the stock.::MicroStrategy (MSTR) is particularly well positioned to benefit from the bitcoin (BTC) halving set to occur around April 20, when new supply of the cryptocurrency will be cut by 50%, broker Benchmark said in a research report on Monday. “We note that the three previous bitcoin halvings, in 2012, 2016, and 2020, saw explosive appreciation in bitcoin’s price occur only after the halving had taken place,” analyst Mark Palmer wrote. The quadrennial halving is when miner rewards are reduced, slowing the rate of growth in bitcoin supply. Benchmark raised its MicroStrategy price target to $1,875 from $990 while maintaining its buy rating. The new price target is based on the assumption that bitcoin will reach $150,000 by the end of 2025, up from $125,000 previously. MicroStrategy shares rose more than 11% to around $1,601 in trading before the official open of U.S. markets. “While the upcoming bitcoin halving will create a supply shock as the previous ones had, we believe the event’s impact could be magnified by the concurrent demand shock created by the emergence of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs),” Palmer wrote, adding that “we expect inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs to grow dramatically once institutions begin to invest in them in earnest.” MicroStrategy has a unique business model based on the acquisition and holding of bitcoin. The company is expected to continue to add to its bitcoin stash using proceeds from capital markets transactions and excess cash generated by its enterprise software business, the report said. Benchmark estimates that the company will hold 298,246 bitcoins by year-end 2025, up from the 214,246 coins it owned as of March 19. Rival broker BTIG said the software developer’s implied premium to bitcoin is supported by investors who want exposure to digital assets but may be unable to invest directly in the cryptocurrency or ETFs, and also supported by the company’s ability to accretively raise capital to purchase additional BTC, it wrote in a report on Friday.

To learn more on how we evaluate each piece of content, please proceed to our verification methodology page The Guru Network is a forward-thinking decentralized project operating at the intersection of blockchain and AI technology. Many of its services are tailored for businesses and projects that require multi-step process automation. This guide covers everything you need to know about Guru Network and its native GURU token in 2024. The Guru Network is an innovative ecosystem of products and services. The network is developing an AI compute multi-chain layer for blockchain-based projects and apps looking to build or enhance AI functionality. The expansive project was initially launched as a decentralized exchange (DEXGuru Trading Terminal) and has since evolved into an all-in-one platform (Guru Network), merging real-world business processes with artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology. In 2024, the platform is a key driver in simplifying AI-focused application development and deployment. We've come a long way from being DeFi trading terminal to evolving into the Guru Network. What started as a tool for traders has transformed into a robust ecosystem for Web3 Automations and AI Compute. Let's dive into this! pic.twitter.com/mgP1uzbwyZ Guru Network provides a framework for blockchain business process automation (BBPA), which facilitates app development with minimal coding requirements. This abstracts the complexity away from its users, who, in turn, can focus on creating value for their own customers. The multi-chain AI compute layer will allow builders to natively embed orchestrated AI agents into their applications on multiple blockchains. The Guru Network contends with a number of limitations in current AI automation offerings for business. Modern-day AI models can be used for pattern recognition, natural language processing (NLP), data analysis, and many other menial tasks. However, there are a few real-world instances that expose the chinks in the armor of AI, thereby limiting its potential in business processes. For example, modern AI models struggle with automating processes that involve several stages. This makes it impractical to rely exclusively on such models in situations where objectives are complex. It’s very important to have a precise problem so that you can solve a precise problem. When you’re not clear, then it’s trying to solve a problem that you don’t even know what the problem is. Furthermore, when AI is used in large-scale operations or processes that involve multiple participants, it fails to scale. This drawback can pose significant bottlenecks in fast-paced environments. Lastly, AI systems lack confidence when interacting with real-world events and actions. This limits their potential to bridge the gap between the physical and digital realms effectively. Guru Network aims to solve some of these issues. By seamlessly merging blockchain and AI, Guru Network super-charges efficiency and ensures that applications are crucially context-aware, optimizing performance within a decentralized framework. The Guru Network offers a suite of features that enhance the functionality and efficiency of decentralized applications (DApps). These features ensure secure, scalable, and efficient operations across various sectors. The Flow Orchestrator acts as the central hub and coordinates activities across the network. It defines and dispatches business processes to the BBPA Engines and sources data from the Guru Data Warehouse, Block Explorer, and trading terminal (DexGuru). Essentially, the Guru Flow Orchestrator links AI models, on-chain processes, and off-chain data, ensuring a seamless flow of operations. This enhances efficiency and broadens the scope of DApps. This feature provides users with a minimal code development environment and a user-friendly interface that streamlines project creation and management. Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is a solution for transferring tokens and sending arbitrary message data to smart contracts on other blockchains. The integration of CCIP into Guru Network’s services ensures secure and efficient off-chain computations and data feeds. This architecture allows for improvements in scalability in sectors like finance, supply chain, and automated customer interactions. Furthermore, CCIP is functional on multiple EVM-compatible blockchains, which allows the Guru Network to expand its services to even more networks. Individual Agents on the Guru Network are similar to AWS Lambda functions. AWS Lambda functions are computing services that run code for applications in response to events or requests without the need to manage servers. Individual Agents, on the other hand, subscribe to tasks, execute various operations, and interact within the Guru Network’s economic framework. The tasks that they execute can vary widely, which may include: Missing those 2017 deep dives into crypto whitepapers? Ours isn’t the easiest read, but it’s packed with insights on how AI meets blockchain. Learn how GURU will help to make this connection seamless. Introducing the Interoperability Architecture WP:https://t.co/JiGsmtjprS pic.twitter.com/DcnUC7J4xH As previously mentioned, DexGuru is the trading terminal of the Guru Network. It was the first service offered by the network. DexGuru is a powerhouse of features, offering value to users in multiple ways. Some included elements are: These are just a few of the features offered by the trading terminal. Users can enjoy these and additional features that will aid them in on-chain analysis and trading. The Guru Network’s Block Explorer is essentially an Etherscan alternative for appchains. It offers some of the same features you see across standard block explorers, such as portfolio view, token balances, smart contract verification, and more. Some of the other advanced features it includes are tracing, an ABI Execution interface, TradingView charts, APIs for developers, and integration into EVM-compatible blockchains. These include: The Data Warehouse is an on-chain data access solution that supports data-intensive applications such as analytics, AI, and machine learning (ML). It provides advanced tools for data ingestion, visualization, and real-time streaming. With this tool, you can integrate your services with the Block Explorer, allowing for advanced data querying; utilize an AI-powered visual SQL editor; create dashboards to visualize complex data; integrate with data warehouses; use community-driven API endpoints; and more. The GURU Framework, a software development kit (SDK), is designed to streamline the development process for developing, deploying, and managing DApps. It gives users a set of tools and libraries that allow them to integrate AI into DApp development. Some of its specific features are integration with the Flow Orchestrator, access to the BBPA engines, synchronization of smart contracts across multiple blockchain networks, an API that bridges web2 and web3, the creation and management of individual agents, and the utilization of the Shared Event Bus. Several necessary participants are involved in the Guru Network, each with a unique task that creates a cohesive system for long-term sustainability. Here’s a snapshot of the setup: Users’ engagement in these roles is crucial, as it creates a feedback loop that generates value throughout the entire Guru network. This value is set to be further enhanced as governance mechanisms, hackathons, developer programs, and the Guru token enrich the ecosystem —and rewards and incentive features are rolled out. $GURU is the native token of the Guru network. It will be used for distributing revenue among many participants in the Guru ecosystem, such as contributors and stakers. As well as being a revenue distribution tool, the token will power the extensive Guru ecosystem. GURU will be utilized to pay transaction and service fees, AI usage and compute fees, Flow orchestrator fees, and more. $GURU token is about to drop. Target launch: end of May. Your best move now?

Gurus and Individual Agents are primarily incentivized through two mechanisms: Users can also lock GURU tokens to support the network and earn rewards. The token will also offer passive income activities beyond staking, including lending, borrowing, and yield farming. GURU will also be used to support bridging and interoperability services. The total supply of GURU is set at 1,000,000,000 GURU. The initial circulating supply will be around 20-30% of total supply. In terms of token allocation, the breakdown is as follows: We’re counting down the weeks until the $GURU token launch. Maximize this time to get ready. Study our docs, whitepaper and litepaper.$GURU will be pivotal in our ecosystem, merging AI and blockchain seamlessly. More details coming soon. Turn on notifications and stay tuned. A number of projects have already integrated Guru’s services across several diverse sectors. Clear examples are Guru’s DexGuru, Block Explorer, and Data Warehouse. However, here are a few examples of other services: Guru Network is the brainchild of Evgeny Vakhteev and Nick Sawinyh. Sawinyh has over a decade of experience in growing and developing applications in the blockchain, crypto, and web3 space. He also has experience as a product and marketing leader and formerly founded Defiprime. Vakhteev is the current CTO of DexGuru, a trading terminal apart of the Guru Network. He has former experience as a software developer at Hulu and an even longer history as the CEO of multiple companies. Some of the other team members include: The DexGuru platform has raised at least $6 million in capital across two funding rounds. The first round, led by ParaFi Capital, raised $1 million. The second round amassed $5 million from familiar faces like Huobi, Wintermute, and Sandeep Nailwal and over a dozen other angel investors, companies, and firms. Some of these include: These investments have allowed the GURU Network to expand from its humble beginnings as a simple EVM-compatible trading terminal to the expansive platform that it is in 2024. In the first quarter of 2024, the project focused on access to the community and early adopters, the Phase 1 testnet for the Block Explorer and Data Warehouse, and the introduction of the Web3 Automation and AI platform. Q1 to Q2 also saw the synchronization of the BBPA Engine and Chainlink’s CCIP. This period will also see a token generation event, the implementation of the Fjord Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool, the launch of the Base Layer 3 testnet, and the launch of the Individual Agents platform. Q2 to Q3 will see the launch of hackathons and community evangelism. Advancements in the AI compute layer will be seen in the third quarter of 2024. The Guru Network will also establish itself as a sync layer, compute for private chains, and decentralize the BBPA Engines and Flow Orchestrator. The Guru Network is a comprehensive platform that bridges the off-chain and on-chain world. It utilizes the innovations of artificial intelligence and blockchain to automate tasks and propel the business world into the future. This allows developers and founders to do what they do best and focus on creating value for their customers. Through its Guru Framework SDK, Data Warehouse, Guru Layer 3, and many other services, this expanding ecosystem offers a valuable service to businesses, projects, and developers in web3 and beyond. Guru Network is a platform that integrates blockchain and artificial technology. It is an ecosystem of services that automates multi-step tasks, particularly for businesses developing decentralized applications. Guru also has a layer-3 built using the Base stack. The GURU token is the incentive layer of the Guru Network. It is sued to bootstrap many of the services on the Guru network. Users can stake, trade, yield farm, and use the token for many other actions. There are multiple participants in the Guru ecosystem. Gurus and Individual Agents are incentivized through collecting fees from services rendered. Ecosystem projects and retail users can also earn through various means as well.

157::https://cryptobriefing.com/kimsuky-hackinggroup-targets-southkorean-crypto/::Crypto Briefing::article::Kimsuky hacking group targets South Korean crypto firms with new malware — report::Kaspersky uncovers a potential link between Kimsuky and the notorious Lazarus Group.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Kimsuky, a North Korean hacking group, has reportedly been utilizing a new malware variant called “Durian” to launch targeted attacks on South Korean crypto firms. The incidence is highlighted in a recently published threat intelligence report from Kaspersky. According to Kaspersky’s research, the malware is deployed specifically to break and exploit against security software used by South Korean crypto firms, at least two of which have been identified. “Based on our telemetry, we pinpointed two victims within the South Korean cryptocurrency sector. The first compromise occurred in August 2023, followed by a second in November 2023. Notably, our investigation did not uncover any additional victims during these instances, indicating a highly focused targeting approach by the actor,” the report stated. The Durian malware is an “initial-stage” installer. It introduces supplementary malware and establishes a persistence mechanism inside the device or instance that it attacks. Once executed, the malware generates a stage loader and adds it to the exposed operating system for automatic execution. The malware’s installation is finalized with a culminating payload written over Golang, an open-source programming language developed by Google. The final payload then enables the execution of remote commands that instruct the exploited device to download and exfiltrate files. The choice of language is also suspect due to Golang’s efficiency for networked machines and large codebases. Interestingly, Kaspersky’s report also revealed that LazyLoad, one of the tools deployed by Durian, has been used by Andariel, a sub-group within the notorious North Korean hacking consortium Lazarus Group. This finding suggests a potential connection between Kimsuky and Lazarus, although Kaspersky described the link as “tenuous” at best. Lazarus Group, which first emerged in 2009, has established itself as one of the most notorious groups of crypto hackers. Independent onchain sleuth ZachXBT recently revealed that the group had successfully laundered over $200 million in ill-gotten crypto between 2020 and 2023. In total, Lazarus is accused of stealing over $3 billion in crypto assets in the six years leading up to 2023. Last week, a US court has ordered the forfeiture of 279 crypto accounts tied to North Korean threat incidents.

158::https://theconversation.com/rise-of-cryptocurrencies-like-bitcoin-begs-question-what-is-money-46713::The Conversation::article::Rise of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin begs question: what is money?::Money used to be backed by something of real value such as gold or silver. Bitcoins and other digital currencies will sever that link forever.::When you begin to delve into the question of what money really is, you must be prepared for some metaphysics. Money, currencies and other such media of exchange differ markedly in their backgrounds and means of operation, and have changed quite recently into forms that are barely understandable. For centuries, minted coins not only represented the value and trust of banks, their depositors and eventually nation-states, but also were deemed valuable because they were made from precious metals like gold and silver. These metals are difficult to move around in large quantities, and so banknotes were invented as early as the seventh century in China and brought to Europe in the 13th century. Unlike coins, banknotes were not treated as valuable in themselves since they were simply printed on otherwise worthless paper. Rather, they served as a form of promissory note or IOU that could be presented to the banks that issued them in exchange for their face value in precious metal, coins or bullion. In the 20th century, most central banks and governments stopped backing up their currencies with precious metals, and yet banknotes maintain fluctuating values, with some in high demand as media for exchange both domestically and internationally. Dollars and euros are highly regarded and preferred currencies for international commerce, as well as for stocking private bank accounts. Now we have bitcoins and other digital currencies that exist entirely in blocks of zeros and ones and are even “mined” by machines running algorithms. And earlier this month, bitcoins and their ilk were officially deemed commodities by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which will now regulate them. So as the greenbacks and quarters in our pockets slowly disappear, replaced by strings of digits stored on our smartphones, and money takes another step away from being tied to anything of value, a philosophical question comes to mind: does money still exist? And if so, what gives it its value? Money is a “fungible” item, which means that exchange of any one portion for a portion of equal value is not a “taking” of property. That is, you don’t own a particular US$100 bill. You own the value it represents. This is how banks have long worked, since when you deposit your money, you are not entitled to receive the same coins or bills back as you deposited. This is also how “fractional reserve” banking began (in which banks do not keep all the curency on deposit “within” the bank, just some fraction of it) and was not regarded somehow as theft. People took their money to a bank, they were given a note of deposit, which entitled them to withdraw the same amount plus some interest, but they were not entitled to the same coins or bills that they deposited. The money on deposit in a bank is not all physically in the bank (excepting that which is in safety deposit boxes) and has not been really since banking was invented. When you deposit a sum, you no longer own the paper or other medium of exchange used for the deposit, legally. What you own is a debt and obligation by the bank to return the equivalent amount of money with interest. John Searle has described things like money as “some special sort” of social objects. That is, X (coins, bills, strings of digits) work as Y (money) in context C (an economy, coffee shop, bank, etc). In the case of money, anything can conceivably take on the Y role even without an X (think a barter economy). Where metals, then bills and now bits in computer memory take the role of X, money might well be a “free-standing” Y, meaning it could exist without anything to represent it except the web of intentional states (the debts and obligations) that make more familiar forms of money function. It’s only physical manifestation might be a note in a ledger. Without precious metal standards backing national currencies, and in the age of digital transactions, money is decreasingly tied to banknotes, just as its ties to metals have faded. Digital ledgers track exchanges and accounts, with digital strings in computer memories representing the trust and value we once attached to more solid things like coins, bills and notes, in more ephemeral digitally encoded, instantly accessible forms attached to cellphones, computers and chip cards. New types of cryptocurrencies (where cryptography protects its integrity) like bitcoin and others take the concept one step further, distributing the banking to all its users, tying the transactions and ledgers to no particular party but to all users at once. This is similar to mirrored bank servers, but bitcoin is mirrored among all bitcoin owners. A bitcoin is as ownable as dollars are when they are deposited in a bank. Skipping the stage of physical, fungible currencies, bitcoins exist by virtue of their representations in a ledger in cyberspace. The information encoded in a massively distributed and constantly updated blockchain is incapable of the exclusivity required for owning objects in the traditional sense. But the same is true of the information that tracks most of the money in the world. Money in nearly every denomination exists and flows in a similar state, represented by digital bits. Bitcoins nonetheless lack some of the institutional guarantees that other types of money has due to nations and their laws. Depositors to banks are protected in their debts by states, generally, and through contracts with their banks. State insurance and the contractual guarantee that a bank will pay back what has been put into them mean that there is some force behind our trust in the continued existence of a person’s wealth while digitally stored in a bank’s servers. The blockchain exists on many servers at once, spread across the universe of bitcoin owners. Without government insurance or contractual guarantees, only mutual trust maintains the value and integrity of the system. What bitcoin owners own is the debt, just as those who own money in banks own debts that are recorded in bits. They do not own the bits that comprise the information representing that debt, nor the information itself, they own the social object – the money – that those bits represent. Bank ledgers exist. They are tangible, even though digital, and they record the debts owed among parties. While cyberspace is ephemeral, it is still real and physically based. Digital bank ledgers now track money without the necessity for physical transfers of currencies. Bitcoins too exist as digital records of obligations, physically encoded on servers of those who hold them, propagated and distributed for transparency and security, encrypted for privacy. Bitcoins are as real as money in banks. What’s most fascinating about these new digital cryptocurrencies is how much they reveal about the surreal nature of currencies and wealth in our digitized economy. If bitcoins are as real as any other money, how real can money be?::2015-09-25T09:20:47Z::Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, Currencies, Money, cashless::David Koepsell::Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/96112/original/image-20150924-17067-1g17suk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C269%2C1500%2C727&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
159::https://www.coindesk.com/sponsored-content/taking-phemex-coos-pulse-after-the-launch-of-phemexpulse/::CoinDesk::article::Taking Phemex COO’s Pulse after the launch of PhemexPulse::N/A::Sponsored Content Phemex has surged over the past year to become one of the world’s leading digital asset exchanges for both spot and futures transactions. It led the way in copy trading, bridged the gap between centralization and decentralization, and most recently, broke new ground with the launch of its revolutionary social trading platform. This innovative platform is crafted to bring the crypto community together, rewarding users for their regular online engagements with tangible benefits. The introduction of PhemexPulse has sparked considerable buzz within the online sphere. CoinDesk reached out to Phemex COO Stella Chan to talk about the inspiration driving the development of PhemexPulse and the strategic moves the company plans to make in fostering dynamic and engaged communities. Thank you for the congratulations! The launch of PhemexPulse has indeed stirred up considerable conversation among crypto enthusiasts. Users have discovered in PhemexPulse a vibrant platform that not only facilitates community engagement but also rewards their participation, creating a unique and interactive experience within the digital asset space. PhemexPulse has become a hub of activity with 160 groups formed by KOLs [key opinion leaders] and content creators in just two weeks. Users love that the platform allows them to continue their usual online activities – like following expert trading tips and engaging in trend discussions with peers – while earning rewards for their participation. And by rewards, we're talking substantial incentives: a daily prize pool of 9,000 PT. [Phemex Tokens, or PT, are the exchange’s native coins.] PT is fundamentally linked to our growing Web3 ecosystem and offers substantial promise for traders. Therefore, we are confident that the prize pool will strongly appeal to our community. The landscape is indeed crowded with social networking platforms that users frequent, particularly during a bull market. PhemexPulse, though, distinguishes itself by not only rewarding users for their consistent online engagement but also by fostering a closer relationship between KOLs and their followers within a conversational environment. It offers a compelling chat-to-earn program for active participation that integrates seamlessly with our Web3 ecosystem. Social trading is gaining significant traction and is expected to be a driving force in the upcoming bull market. While current offerings provide a preview of SocialFi's capabilities, there remains a void for a truly Web3-native social platform that prioritizes community interaction. PhemexPulse fills this niche by delivering an authentic, on-the-ground perspective of the crypto market's pulse through peer discussions and activities. Unlike other social trading platforms that focus solely on incentivizing trading, our approach is to cultivate a spirit of collaboration. We aim to foster grassroots innovation within PhemexPulse through Pulse Groups, where the ideas and contributions of any member can be recognized and developed into projects that benefit from a fair launch process, ensuring a level playing field for all. We understand that KOLs have a variety of platforms to connect with their audience. Yet these platforms often dictate the terms of content creation, while PhemexPulse embraces Web3 principles to return control and ownership to the users. Collaborations and engagements within the PhemexPulse ecosystem directly translate into rewards. Our platform is designed to facilitate community contributions and the accumulation of tokens. For KOLs, monetizing their influence is as straightforward as establishing their own Web3 group on PhemexPulse, with funding from Phemex. By creating a group and fostering dialogue with their followers – through quality content and trading insights – KOLs can earn daily rewards in PT, based on their points accrued. PhemexPulse enables KOLs to excel by leveraging their strengths: leading and engaging with their audience. It removes barriers to community interaction, while Phemex provides the means to convert their influence into tangible PT wealth. We believe this model of engagement, unshackled from the confines of traditional social media and coupled with a reward system intrinsic to Web3, will forge new opportunities for KOLs. On PhemexPulse we also provide them an avenue to unveil their exclusive inscriptions and share with their fans. These assets hold great potential and represent a mutually beneficial opportunity for both the KOLs and their followers to possess and exchange. Inscriptions, akin to NFTs, are unique digital assets recorded directly onto the blockchain. Creators can craft these inscriptions and offer them to their followers, who can mint, own and trade them. On PhemexPulse, for instance, crypto influencers act as content creators and can launch their distinct ordinals through our inscription marketplace, allowing the value of each to be shaped by their community's demand. Supporters can engage with and back their preferred influencers on PhemexPulse by acquiring these inscriptions. Inscriptions on PhemexPulse are a testament to the platform's foundational principles. PhemexPulse thrives on the creation of decentralized communities, spearheaded by KOLs. Within these groups, members have the freedom to collaborate and initiate their Web3 projects, enjoying full autonomy. We promote the development of distinctive group cultures and support the creation of community tokens through inscriptions, to enhance group solidarity and cohesion. Our team has dedicated significant effort to devising a scoring system that genuinely benefits our users. We are committed to ensuring that their contributions are recognized and rewarded fairly. We have developed a system designed to enhance user engagement on PhemexPulse and the Phemex trading platform, aiming to forge a comprehensive hub that addresses users' trading and social interaction needs, empowering them through their activities on our platform. In tune with our community-focused approach, we've decided to restructure the PhemexPulse scoring system to better align with user feedback. The newly launched mechanism will emphasize fairness while introducing gamified elements. Within PhemexPulse, users can earn points through a variety of actions, including messaging within groups, executing trades and referring new users. Reward points have no expiration date, providing ongoing value for our users' trading efforts. Additionally, we've introduced Raffle Fuel points, adding an extra dimension to our rewards system. Raffle Fuel points can be accrued through various trading activities on Phemex. The proportion of Reward and Raffle Fuel points compared to the total available points will determine the users’ PT payout. The total prize pool for PhemexPulse is a remarkable 50 million PT. With our updated scoring system, we're allocating 9,000 PT each day from our prize pool for distribution throughout this round. I must add that we have revamped the scoring system in response to our users' feedback, who are at the forefront of our efforts. We will continue to listen to their needs and make the necessary adjustments to the scoring system in the next rounds to ensure that they are rewarded fairly for their interactions. Yes, we have so many exciting opportunities for traders. I mentioned earlier that PhemexPulse hosts an inscription marketplace where KOLs list their exclusive ordinals for minting, holding and trading. These limited edition assets allow users to own valuable items from top crypto figures and open up additional profit avenues. Notably, crypto influencer Ben Armstrong's ordinals on PhemexPulse saw astonishing growth within the first week of its release, driving real value for its holders. We've also recently updated the qualifications for becoming a PhemexPulse group owner, moving beyond the initial requirement of having at least 500 Twitter followers. We aim to make PhemexPulse a hub for all who are shaping Web3 and contributing uniquely to the crypto world. With these inclusive criteria, we aim to draw a variety of visionary leaders. We invite content creators to join us in steering the future of crypto.

To learn more on how we evaluate each piece of content, please proceed to our verification methodology page Charles Hoskinson is a prolific figure in the cryptocurrency industry. He’s among the original Ethereum co-founders, having worked alongside Vitalik Buterin and others to build Ethereum. Hoskinson also briefly served as the Ethereum CEO before a fallout that saw him leave the Ethereum network to build Cardano, a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain. Read on to learn who Charles Hoskinson is, what he does, why he is important, and some of the challenges he has experienced. Charles Hoskinson is an American mathematician and tech entrepreneur in the web3 space. He was born in Hawaii, USA, in 1987 to a family of doctors. Hoskinson initially toyed with following in his parents’ footsteps to study medicine. However, he later chartered his path and instead chose to study mathematics. Charles Hoskinson began his academic journey at the Metropolitan State University of Denver, where he earned a degree in analytic number theory. He then enrolled for a Master’s in Mathematics at the University of Colorado Boulder. Hoskinson later enrolled for his PhD but dropped out before he could graduate and joined Ron Paul’s 2008 presidential campaign. Paul’s libertarian views fueled Hoskinson’s decision to join his campaign. Hoskinson was fascinated by Austrian economics and monetary theory, which argued that an economic system founded on fiat currency is essentially unstable, worked. Something that Bitcoin, the first digital currency, attempted to address. Given that the crypto market is volatile, it’s difficult to get the exact net worth of prolific figures in the space, including Hoskinson. This is because his net worth is directly connected to his crypto holdings, and a large chunk of it is linked to the value of the ADA coin. However, most estimates have placed his net worth somewhere between $500 and $600 million. Still, this is subject to change based on Cardano’s price action and the future ADA price. Hoskinsom has founded and co-founded three crypto-related companies: Ethereum, IOHK, and Invictus Innovations. Charles is among the eight co-founders of the Ethereum network and the founder and CEO of Cardano. He has also held various positions in both the private and public sectors. Charles Hoskinson was also the founding chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation’s education committee and helped establish the Cryptocurrency Research Group in 2013. Well-revered within the crypto community, Hoskinson has built projects to educate people about blockchain technology and decentralized assets. He co-founded BitShares, an early crypto-decentralized exchange (DEX) platform. As the Cardano founder, Hoskinson continues to lead the design, development, and research of the Cardano blockchain and ADA cryptocurrency. Besides being a tech entrepreneur and founding several crypto-related entities, Charles Hoskinson is also a philanthropist. In 2020, Hoskinson’s company, IOHK, donated $500,000 in ADA cryptocurrency to the University of Wyoming and established a Cardano Research Lab to advance the research and development of blockchain technology. In 2021, he donated $20 million to Carnegie Mellon University to build a center for mathematics named Hoskinson Center for Formal Mathematics. According to the university’s website, “the center is dedicated to using formal computational methods and new technologies for mathematical research and education.” In 2022, IOHK donated $4.5 million to the research hub at the University of Edinburgh to fund research on new projects that would advance blockchain development. Did you know? Charles Hoskinson’s IOHK rebranded to Input Output Global (IOG) in 2021 after moving its headquarters from Hong Kong, China, to Wyoming, U.S. With over 900,000 followers on X (formerly Twitter), Charles Hoskinson is a mathematician and crypto entrepreneur primarily known for creating Cardano, a proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol. The Cardano blockchain has its own native crypto, ADA, which has a maximum supply of 45 billion coins. Hoskinson is also the CEO of IOHK, a company he founded in 2015 alongside Jeremy Wood. IOHK markets itself as “one of the world’s pre-eminent blockchain infrastructure research and engineering companies.” He is also one of Ethereum’s co-founders. Ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency globally in terms of market capitalization. He also had a brief stint as the CEO of the Ethereum network. Before Hoskinson joined the crypto community as an entrepreneur, he was one of the presidential campaign for Ron Paul in 2008. He then went ahead to work at a consultancy firm. Hoskinson also stated that he briefly worked at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), even though the institute has never formally acknowledged or refuted his claims. He was also the founding chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation’s education committee and helped to create the Cryptocurrency Research Group. Charles Hoskinson has made significant contributions to the cryptocurrency and blockchain technology industry. As explained in previous sections, he was part of the founding team that created the framework and vision for the Ethereum network. He also helped build Ethereum’s highly successful initial coin offering (ICO). Besides Ethereum, Hoskinson also built the Cardano blockchain and the ADA coin, a leading altcoin in the crypto asset market. Cardano is a next-generation blockchain network, smart contract platform, and digital currency built for scale and speed, and it is more secure than older blockchains. It’s also home to thousands of decentralized applications (DApps). He also created the ADA cryptocurrency that powers the Cardano ecosystem. The ADA coin has several uses, including paying transaction fees on the network and sending and receiving payments. Moreover, ADA holders can also stake Cardano to validate transactions and secure the network. It also almost always ranks among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Before Cardano existed, Hoskinson was involved in developing the Ethereum network. In 2013, Anthony Di Lorio, another of Ethereum’s co-founders and fellow Bitcoin enthusiast, introduced Hoskinson to the Ethereum whitepaper. Hoskinson became intrigued and began attending early Ethereum meetings. He would later join the team and become one of the network’s founders. While it isn’t entirely clear what his exact role was in creating Ethereum, he was, nevertheless, pivotal for the network’s success. Hoskinson helped develop Ethereum’s first ICO and was also part of the decision-makers who decided to register the Ethereum Foundation in Switzerland. Trouble began when part of the team wanted Ethereum to take a non-profit approach. Hoskinson, on the other hand, wanted Ethereum to be a for-profit project. Some of the developers, including Vitalik, disagreed with this. Hoskinson also disagreed with the approach of having the Ethereum network use the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which made it less environmentally friendly than blockchains with PoS-based consensus protocols. Following these disagreements, Hoskinson left Ethereum and took a six-month sabbatical. He briefly toyed with the idea of going back to mathematics before Jeremy Wood, another Ethereum co-founder approached him with the idea of establishing an engineering and research firm that would develop blockchains and digital currencies for academic institutions, corporations, and government entities. The company was named Input Output Hong Kong, or IOHK. Hoskinson would later suggest developing a “Japanese version of Ethereum” for a client. In 2017, Hoskinson built and launched Cardano, an open-source, decentralized, intelligent contract protocol initially focused on the Japanese market. It would later expand its operations globally. So far, Cardano has been the most noteworthy project developed by IOHK. Cardano is Charles Hoskinson’s most prestigious and popular web3 venture. He began developing the PoS blockchain in 2015 with the help of Wood. The project was created to be everything that he wanted Ethereum to be but wasn’t at the time. The vision behind Cardano was to improve on the functionality that was initially missing in Ethereum. Hoskinson, therefore, developed Cardano with an efficient and environmentally friendly consensus mechanism, the proof-of-stake protocol. This was so that it could be more efficient than older blockchains that relied on the proof-of-work mechanism. Moreover, Hoskinson also wanted a protocol that could address the major problems facing other blockchains, such as decentralization, scalability, security, and smart contract functionality. He wanted Cardano to be more flexible, scalable, and secure than Bitcoin and Ethereum. Hoskinson also envisioned a blockchain network that would advance into a network for decentralized applications with numerous use cases governed by stakers. Cardano has over 1,000 projects developing web3 decentralized applications on its platform today. The protocol’s native coin, ADA, is named after the Countess of Lovelace, Augusta Ada King, who was the first computer programmer. Users can trade ADA from most crypto wallets and exchanges like other cryptocurrencies. IOHK was established in 2015 by Charles Hoskinson and Jeremy Wood. IOHK is a leading research and engineering company in the blockchain space. IOHK aims to develop blockchain projects for academic institutions and companies in the private and public sectors. Its most significant blockchain project is Cardano, a leading smart contract platform. Hoskinson got the idea to develop Cardano after a client proposed building a “Japanese version of Ethereum.” However, he was motivated to build Cardano as an improved version of first (Bitcoin) and second-generation (Ethereum) blockchains. He wanted Cardano to address the limitations he perceived Bitcoin and Ethereum lacked, including scalability and security issues. The Cardano blockchain differs from other blockchains through its diligent peer-reviewed research foundation that aims to create a more interoperable, scalable, and secure blockchain network. Utilizing the PoS consensus mechanism means that Cardano is energy-efficient and sustainable. In addition, he wanted to create a protocol that was accessible and useful to billions of people, especially the unbanked, across various populations worldwide. As a passionate public speaker and advocate for blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, Charles Hoskinson has faced a few challenges. Users have accused Hoskinson of having too much control over the decision-making process at Cardano. Moreover, Cardano’s roadmap has also been criticized for being too long and slow to progress. There was also a controversy with Laura Shin, a journalist and author, who criticized Hoskinson for his contribution to the blockchain and crypto space. In February 2022, Laura Shin, a crypto journalist, Unchained podcast host, and author of The Cryptopians, suggested in her book that Charles Hoskinson never finished his undergraduate degree or enrolled in a PhD program. The controversy started on X (formerly Twitter) when a user tweeted that they were reading Shin’s book and were fascinated by Hoskinson’s early years in crypto. Hoskinson responded to the tweet, calling Shin’s book a “great work of fiction.”  Not one to take it lying down, Shin responded to Hoskinson’s tweet asking him to address the discrepancies in his claims of having dropped out of his PhD program despite the school stating that he had only enrolled for his undergraduate degree. Shin stated that she had thoroughly researched her book and had even contacted both universities that Hoskinson claimed he attended. In her book, Shin noted that the Metropolitan State University of Denver didn’t have a graduate math program. She asserted that both universities stated that Hoskinson enrolled and studied as an undergraduate but didn’t graduate from either university. Shin also wrote in her book that Hoskinson’s claims that he worked at DARPA were false. In her tweets to the Cardano founder, Shin also tweeted that she had given Hoskinson and his team ample time to talk to her and offer their perspective, but they never did. It, therefore, remains unclear whether Hoskinson earned an undergrad and master’s degree from the two universities. Hoskinson has been quite vocal about his approach, thoughts, and views on cryptocurrencies and the blockchain. He has in the past shared his views regarding the purpose of digital currencies on X, stating that: “Crypto doesn’t want to set the world on fire; it just wants to start a flame in your heart.” Through his company, IOHK, he has funded various blockchain technology research labs globally to boost blockchain and crypto adoption. He has also shared his thoughts on the high energy that older blockchains such as Bitcoin consume. He believes that blockchain technology is the future and that it’ll help the world become a more inclusive and better place. Charles Hoskinson has significantly contributed to the crypto sector since he started in 2013. He was part of the team that created the Ethereum network before he left to establish Cardano. Through IOHK, Hoskinson hopes to educate and provide financial services to the three billion people worldwide who lack an equitable and transparent financial system. Charles Hoskinson created Cardano as a decentralized, smart contract platform that was much more flexible, scalable, and secure than other blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Charles Hoskinson is currently the founder and CEO of IOHK. He is also the founder of Cardano and continues to lead the design, development, and research of the Cardano blockchain and ADA cryptocurrency. He is also a public speaker and advocate for blockchain and crypto. Charles Hoskinson is the founder of Cardano. He developed the Cardano network, a proof-of-stake blockchain, after discussions with a client who proposed that they build a “Japanese version of Ethereum” in 2015. Cardano is famous as the first blockchain to evolve from cryptographic and scientific peer-review research methods. The blockchain was also designed to be energy-efficient and provide an open-source platform to offer people accessible economic services by hosting decentralized applications. Cardano is special because it is a sustainable, environmentally friendly blockchain. This is thanks to using the PoS consensus mechanism, Ouroboros, instead of the energy-intensive PoW system used by blockchains like Bitcoin. Cardano uses the PoS consensus mechanism and follows a systematic and more formal method. It employs peer review and academic research in its design and implementation. In addition, several entities, including the Cardano Foundation, Emurgo, IOHK, and its treasury system, are involved in the protocol’s decision-making. Cardano utilizes a layered architecture, which separates the protocol’s settlement layer (Cardano Settlement Layer, CSL) from the platform’s computation layer (Cardano Computation Layer, CCL). This division enables Cardano to enjoy greater scalability and flexibility. Charles Hoskinson established The Bitcoin Education Project, which offered free, peer-reviewed content on cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Hoskinson’s goal with the project was to lower the cryptocurrency knowledge barrier and educate one million users by 2014. The project saw him secure partnerships with Bitcoin Magazine and Udemy. Over the years, the Cardano blockchain has contributed to global blockchain adoption by offering a platform that’s easily accessible for users to build DApps on. Moreover, The Cardano Foundation is actively working to drive the widespread adoption of the platform to academic institutions, businesses, and organizations.

161::https://blockworks.co/news/bank-of-england-trials-blockchain::Blockworks::article::Even the Bank of England is part of a shift to blockchain use cases::A liquidity management network for wholesale payments and tokenized real-world assets took a step forward this week.::Fnality’s new network for wholesale payments and tokenized real-world assets reflects TradFi’s continued use of blockchain aslysun/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks A liquidity management network for wholesale payments and tokenized real-world assets took a step forward this week as the use of blockchain tech continues to reverberate around the traditional finance space. Financial firms Lloyds Banking Group, Banco Santander and UBS took part in the new payment system, launched by blockchain payments startup Fnality. Via the Sterling Fnality Payment System, the live payments took place in a Fnality-held omnibus account within the Bank of England’s real-time gross settlement service (RTGS), Fnality said in a Thursday news release. The UK central bank said in April 2021 that it would allow RTGS to interface with more payment systems, such as ones that use distributed ledger technology. Read more: TradFi, DeFi convergence continues through tokenizing real-world assets The latest payments point to a future utilizing new digital models to allow transactions “in both wholesale financial markets and emerging tokenized asset markets,” the company added. The launch comes after the Sterling Fnality Payment System was recognized by HM Treasury as a regulated payment system in August 2022, bringing it into the remit of the Bank of England and the UK’s Payment Systems Regulator. “As we step into 2024, our focus sharpens on scaling up operations within a managed and approved framework as set out by the Bank of England, and steadily progressing towards unlocking new market use cases,” Fnality UK CEO Angus Fletcher said in a statement. Fnality raised $95 million last month from Goldman Sachs, BNP Paribas and others. The startup creates tokenized versions of major currencies — including US dollars, euros, British pounds, Canadian dollars and Japanese yen — that are collateralized by cash held at central banks. These payments are the latest example of blockchain technology becoming more prevalent in the traditional finance realm. JPMorgan has for years been exploring tokenization and blockchain initiatives, facilitating a collateral transaction between BlackRock and Barclays in October via a decentralized application. The company also recently unveiled a programmable payments offering for blockchain-based accounts on the permissioned JPM Coin System. Most big financial institutions are exploring use cases of tokenization, according to Samir Kerbage, chief investment officer at Brazil-based asset manager Hashdex — citing conversations with such companies. “We’re seeing more and more of those use cases coming to market, especially when we’re talking about tokenizing real-world assets and bringing those assets to the blockchain,” Kerbage said during a Wednesday webinar. 21.co research analyst Carlos Gonzalez Campo said during a separate Wednesday webinar that 2023 represented an “experimental stage” for tokenization. “Moving on into 2024 I think what you can expect is more…moving things into production and actually scaling it,” he added. “I think you will have some challenges to achieve that, namely cross-chain communication. The Bank of England is set to assess the Sterling Fnality Payment System’s initial operations “against regulatory expectations as we scale up to commercial operations,” Fnality said. A central bank spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment. The House of Commons Treasury Committee advised the Bank of England and HM Treasury to thoughtfully consider the introduction of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the UK.

The New York Federal Reserve said in July — following a three months-long experiment with major banks — that centralized blockchain payments could help address pain points in the settlement process.

The data reveals Cardano had 611.47 significant updates on GitHub in the last month, which is more than any other cryptocurrency project. Previously, Cardano trailed behind Polkadot (DOT) and its trial network, Kusama (KSM). At present, both Polkadot and KSM have recorded 500.67 GitHub updates, putting them jointly in the second position. Santiment believes that when a blockchain shows a lot of development activity, it suggests developers trust its future potential and are likely preparing to introduce new features. At the moment, ADA’s value stands at $0.251, dropping by over 2% in a day. Furthermore, Santiment is monitoring the amount of Bitcoin (BTC) available on crypto exchanges. Their findings show that only 5.68% of BTC is on exchanges, which is the smallest percentage seen in nearly six years. Related: What is Cardano (Ada)? Is it a good investment in 2023? A decrease in Bitcoin availability on exchanges might reduce the effect of potential large sales in the future. This trend hints that many in the market are holding onto their Bitcoin for the foreseeable future. Santiment adds, “Recently, the most substantial amount of Bitcoin, exceeding 10,000 BTC, left exchanges since September 7th. With the leading crypto’s market cap aiming for a $28,000 valuation for the second time, it’s essential to note that unique address interactions have decreased to a level not seen in six weeks.” source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

163::https://cryptobriefing.com/franklin-templeton-blockchain-cost-savings-tokenization/::Crypto Briefing::article::Franklin Templeton CEO: Blockchain offers major cost savings for tokenization::Jenny Johnson thinks blockchain is “a very efficient technology.” Data is the next oil::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson, speaking at the 27th Annual Milken Institute Global Conference in California, praised blockchain’s efficiency and cost reduction in asset tokenization and shared her thoughts on the benefits of generative AI. Johnson stated that the company ran a parallel experiment for six to eight months, processing account records using both traditional and blockchain methods. The results showed that blockchain was more cost-effective and produced fewer errors. “We used to run our own in-house, one of the few firms that did. And the one that we built on blockchain. So these are the records of the shareholders and we parallel process for a period of 6 to 8 months,” Johnson said. “And we were astonished by how much less, how much cost it was to run a blockchain. It’s a very effective technology, and we think it is going to open up a lot of new investment opportunities,” she emphasized. Johnson predicts that all ETFs and mutual funds could eventually transition to blockchain technology. She believes this shift would lead to significant cost savings due to the elimination of data verification between different systems on the blockchain. “Eventually, I think exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds are all going to be on blockchain,” Johnson stated. “In the case of blockchain, there’s only one source of trust. That transaction happens, everybody has the source of trust, and so that drives out a lot of costs. And when you can drive out the friction in transactions, you can start to invest in new areas,” she explained. Franklin Templeton is behind one of the world’s leading equity tokenized funds, the Franklin OnChain US Government Money Fund (FOBXX), represented by the BENJI token. As of May 12, the BENJI token had a market capitalization of $368 million, according to Dune Analytics. In addition to tokenization, Johnson also discussed the role of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in assisting asset managers to better meet customers’ needs. According to her, “data is the next oil next year.” She believes that large asset managers will have an edge in the AI race because these firms have much proprietary data to analyze and train AI models. Johnson said Franklin Templeton has introduced an AI bot to their help desk to assist with handling inquiries, and the bot is capable of handling 60% of queries. However, the real potential is “a model that’s leveraging a bunch of different AI,” she noted. She believes these advancements could pave the way for highly personalized investment strategies.

Against those who see the radical possibilities of a frictionless payment system designed for the internet, there is a growing resistance to the currencies that threaten existing business models and the perceived traceability of our current currency systems. Leading the resistance against digital currencies are the banks, with the latest recruit to these ranks, Australian bank NAB, closing accounts of customers whose businesses are engaged in exchanging cryptocurrencies. An Australian trader operating through LocalBitcoins.com and an another Australian Bitcoin exchange CoinJar have received letters from NAB informing them that: NAB joins banks in China such as the Agricultural Bank of China, that has moved to freeze the accounts of one of China’s larger Bitcoin exchanges, BtcTrade. Likewise, banks in Canada have already largely blocked accounts used for companies trading cryptocurrencies. It is easy to point to the recent failure of Bitcoin exchange Mt Gox and the subsequent law suits that have embroiled Japanese bank Mizhuo, as a catalyst for NAB’s move. But if banks refused to service businesses after one or more of their kind went bust, they would not be left with very many clients. The risk assessed was also not one based on the companies involved, their operations or their clients, it was simply a matter of the business they were in. While moves by banks to manage risk is something most customers would welcome, the global financial crisis showed us banks’ views of risk are highly selective and largely determined by the other part of this equation: the rewards. In terms of cryptocurrencies, the rewards to banks at present are very low. This is especially the case for a currency that is designed to largely cut them out of the picture. Bitcoin and other digital currencies are designed to be exchanged directly between senders and receivers. This means that currently, transaction costs and bank fees can be avoided, so banks’ enthusiasm for supporting this industry or promoting it would be tepid at best. The real risk to banks is perhaps then not that posed by customers using accounts to enable Bitcoin exchanges, but the threat to their bottom line. NAB’s own senior currency analyst Emma Lawson has argued Bitcoin has many of the characteristics of regular currency, and that its potential to become a successful payment system it contingent on people’s continued belief in it. Clearly something that banks aren’t yet willing to see happen. If banks are asked to justify their decisions purely on risk, they are likely to point to Bitcoin’s association with criminal activities. The rhetoric here has recently stepped up with the European police chief claiming we’re just seeing the beginning of Bitcoin’s use by criminal organisations. Other than the clear use of Bitcoin as the payment system of illegal websites such as Silk Road, the use of cryptocurrencies as a proportion of the total value of money involved in crime is probably tiny. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that in 2009 the total amount of money involved in global criminal activity was US$2.1 trillion. The total market capitilisation of all cryptocurrencies is currently less than US$10 billion. Cryptocurrencies may appear to be ideally suited to money laundering, but the problem is they eventually have to be exchanged for real currency, which immediately causes problems if you are trying to move large amounts of money. The second issue is the extremely volatile value of such currencies. There is a large risk that money with a certain value ends up being worth a lot less by the time it has been laundered and converted into a currency that can be actually put to some use. Of the U$2.1 trillion that is involved annually in global criminal activity, most, if not all, will pass through banks at some point, and not surprisingly, will drive revenue for those banks. The idea then that digital currencies pose a larger theoretical threat seems somewhat absurd in comparison to the very real crime involving real currency. Governments around the world have moved to deal with the lack of regulations on Bitcoin by either banning the currency outright, as in Thailand, or practising “masterly inactivity”, essentially delaying making any moves that might legitimise digital currencies and the industries that would then arise around them. In this regulatory vacuum, banks have been able to protect themselves against the threat of the bankless payment system that digital currencies represent.::2014-04-11T01:03:11Z::Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, Currency, NAB::David Glance::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/46144/original/5sfk8nbn-1397173139.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
165::https://www.coindesk.com/sponsored-content/influencer-achieves-significant-growth-through-inscriptions-on-phemex/::CoinDesk::article::Influencer Achieves Significant Growth Through Inscriptions on Phemex::N/A::Sponsored Content Phemex, a leading digital asset exchange, recognizes the pivotal role that platforms play as trusted partners in nurturing crypto communities. That’s why it has a detailed plan to ensure its traders are united and empowered. The team behind Phemex has recently rolled out its new social trading feature, PhemexPulse, and it swiftly grabbed the crypto space’s attention. Intrinsically linked to the Web3 ecosystem, PhemexPulse offers a lucrative daily earning scheme that turns your routine social interactions into crypto rewards. However, the appeal of PhemexPulse extends beyond its rewards scheme, giving back to users for their engagement. The platform also features a unique inscription marketplace, where key opinion leaders (KOLs) can release exclusive inscriptions for their followers to mint, collect and trade. Ben Armstrong, a prominent figure in the crypto world, was the first to introduce his inscriptions on PhemexPulse, which led to an impressive surge in value of over 7,296% within the initial post-launch hours. This momentum was sustained over the next five days, culminating in a new all-time high (ATH) on March 20, representing a 56% increase from its initial peak. This remarkable growth translated into a cumulative 11,400% gain for the asset holders. In just one week's time, a user who started by minting 10 inscriptions, earning them 10 PT on day one, has experienced a staggering growth, with their holdings skyrocketing to 1000 PT. “Ben has long been a pivotal influencer within the crypto sphere, offering seasoned advice to crypto enthusiasts,” says Phemex COO Stella Chan. “His decision to release his inscriptions on PhemexPulse was met with enthusiasm, as the community eagerly seized the opportunity to acquire them.” Before we get too far ahead of ourselves, though, let’s assume not everyone knows what inscriptions – and their related assets, ordinals – are. They’ve only been around for about a year. They’re basically NFTs predicated on bitcoin. Ordinals are a system for ordering sats – that is, bitcoin fractions – in a way that renders them non-fungible. Inscriptions, then, are the contents of the ordinal NFT. They can be images, videos, texts or any other data. On PhemexPulse, KOLs act as content creators and can also launch their distinct ordinals through an inscription marketplace, allowing the community’s aggregate demand to determine the value of each. Supporters vote with their wallets by acquiring these inscriptions to engage with and back their preferred influencers on PhemexPulse. Recently, Armstrong – who has 100,000 YouTube followers – introduced his exclusive inscriptions on PhemexPulse, limiting ownership to just 600 enthusiasts, with no more than 10 inscriptions per person. Scarcity tends to drive up prices, so the market met this release with an immediate surge. “Ben’s inscriptions are a testament to the explosive potential in this space,” according to Chan. “At Phemex, we're not just strengthening community ties by facilitating deeper connections with leading crypto figures, but also providing a gateway to a vibrant market.” KOLs including Armstrong can nest pretty much any kind of data they want in these NFTs. Some might be collectible in their own right with no intrinsic value beyond the influencer’s fandom – but they might still be fun and lucrative to acquire. Others, though, could conceivably contain investment tips, instructions to access insider-only coin drops or other opportunities to earn. And there’s a potential early-adopter benefit to acquiring inscriptions before anyone else has even heard of them. The value of inscriptions on PhemexPulse are measured in PT, Phemex’s native coin. While Armstrong deserves credit for paving the way, the inscription market has a lot of growth potential for other influencers looking to get in on the ground floor. KOLs can monetize their influence on PhemexPulse simply by creating their own Web3 group, funded by Phemex. By attracting followers with top-notch content and trading tips, these influencers and their followers can unlock daily PT rewards based on their accumulated points. Indeed, the landscape is crowded with various social networking platforms that users frequent, particularly during a bull market. However, PhemexPulse distinguishes itself by not only rewarding users for their consistent online engagement, but also by fostering a closer relationship between KOLs and their followers within a conversational environment. It has already cultivated a dynamic marketplace where unique creations can be minted, held and valued. Phemex is now inviting more content creators to join PhemexPulse and establish their own groups, capitalizing on the myriad opportunities that both they and the market offer.

166::https://beincrypto.com/the-dangers-of-chatgpt-ai-no-one-is-talking-about/::BeInCrypto::article::Are We Ready for ChatGPT? The Dangers of AI No One Is Talking About::While ChatGPT may look like a harmless free tool, this technology can potentially reshape our economy and society as we know it.::We use cookies to improve your experience.  While ChatGPT may look like a harmless and useful free tool, this technology has the potential to reshape our economy and society as we know it drastically. That brings us to alarming problems – and we might not be ready for them. ChatGPT, a chatbot powered by artificial intelligence (AI), took the world by storm by the end of 2022. The chatbot promises to disrupt search as we know it. The free tool provides useful answers based on prompts the users give to it. And what’s making the internet go crazy about the AI chatbot system is that it doesn’t only give search engine tool-like answers. ChatGPT can create movie outlines, write entire codes and solve coding problems, write entire books, songs, poems, scripts – or whatever you can think of – within minutes. This technology is impressive, and it crossed over one million users in just five days after its launch. Despite its mind-blowing performance, OpenAI’s tool has raised concerns among academics and experts from other areas. Dr. Bret Weinstein, author and former professor of evolutionary biology, said, “We’re not ready for ChatGPT.” Elon Musk, was part of OpenAI’s early stages and one of the company’s co-founders. But later stepped down from the board. He spoke many times about the dangers of AI technology – he said that unrestricted use and development pose a significant risk to the existence of humanity. ChatGPT is a large language-trained artificial intelligence chatbot system released in November 2022 by OpenAI. The capped-profit company developed ChatGPT for a “safe and beneficial” use of AI that can answer almost anything you can think of – from rap songs, art prompts to movie scripts and essays. As much as it seems like a creative entity that knows what’s saying, it’s not. The AI chatbot scours information on the internet using a predictive model from a massive data center. Similar to what Google and most search engines do. Then, it’s trained and exposed to tons of data that allows the AI to become very good at predicting the sequence of words up to the point that it can put together incredibly long explanations. For example, you can ask encyclopedia questions like, “Explain the three laws of Einstein.” Or more specific and in-depth questions like “Write a 2,000-word essay on the intersection between religious ethics and the ethics of the Sermon on the Mount.” And, I kid you not, you’ll have your text brilliantly written in seconds. In the same way, it is all brilliant and impressive; it is alarming and concerning. An “Ex Machina” type of dystopian future breaking bad is a possibility with the misuse of AI. Not only has the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX warned us, but many experts have also sounded the alarm. Artificial intelligence has undoubtedly impacted our lives, the economic system and society. If you think that AI is something new or that you’ll only see it in futuristic sci-fi movies, think twice. Many tech companies such as Netflix, Uber, Amazon and Tesla employ AI to enhance their operations and expand their business. For instance, Netflix relies on AI technology for their algorithm to recommend new content for their users. Uber uses it in customer service, to detect fraud, to optimize drives route, and so on, just to name a few examples. However, you can only go so far with such prominent technology without threatening human roles in many traditional occupations, touching the threshold of what comes from a machine and humans. And, perhaps more importantly, threatening the risks of AI to humans. According to Wikipedia, the ethics of artificial intelligence “is the branch of the ethics of technology specific to artificially intelligent systems. It is sometimes divided into a concern with the moral behavior of humans as they design, make, use and treat artificially intelligent systems, and a concern with the behavior of machines in machine ethics.” As AI technology spreads fast and becomes integral to most of our daily lives, organizations are developing AI codes of ethics. The goal is to guide and develop the industry’s best practices to guide AI development with “ethics, fairness and industry.” However, as wonderful and moral as it seems on paper, most of these guidelines and frameworks are difficult to apply. In addition, they seem to be isolated principles situated in industries that generally lack ethical morals and mostly serve corporate agendas. Many experts and prominent voices argue that AI ethics are largely useless, lacking meaning and coherence. The most common AI principles are beneficence, autonomy, justice, applicability, and non-maleficence. But, as Luke Munn, from Institute for Culture and Society, at Western Sydney University explains, these terms overlap and often shift significantly depending on the context. He even states that “terms like ‘beneficence’ and ‘justice’ can simply be defined in ways that suit, conforming to product features and business goals that have already been decided.” In other words, corporations could claim they adhere to such principles according to their own definition without truly engaging with them to any degree. Authors Rességuier and Rodrigues affirm that AI ethics remain toothless because ethics is being used in place of regulation. In practical terms, how would applying these principles collide with corporate practice? We’ve laid out some of them: To train these AI systems, it’s necessary to feed them with data. Enterprises need to ensure that there are no biases regarding ethnicity, race, or gender. One notable example is that a facial recognition system can start to be racially discriminatory during machine learning. By far, one of the biggest issues with AI is the need for more regulation. Who’s running and controlling these systems? Who’s responsible for making those decisions and who can be held accountable? Without regulation or legislation opens the door to a Wild Wild West of self-made ambiguous and glossy terms aiming to defend one’s interest and push agendas. According to Munn, privacy is another vague term often used by corporations with double standards. Facebook is a great example – Mark Zuckerberg has fiercely defended Facebook’s user’s privacy. How behind closed doors, his company was selling their data to third-party companies. For instance, Amazon uses Alexa to collect customer data; Mattel has Hello Barbie, an AI-powered doll that records and collects what children say to the doll. This is one of Elon Musk’s biggest concerns. Democratization of AI, in his view, is when no company or small set of individuals has control over advanced artificial intelligence technology. That’s not what’s happening today. Unfortunately, this technology concentrates in the hands of a few – big tech corporations. Despite Musk’s effort to democratize AI when he first co-founded OpenAI as a non-profit organization. In 2019, the company received $1 billion in funding from Microsoft. The company’s original mission was to develop AI to benefit humanity responsibly. However, the compromise changed when the company shifted to a capped profit. OpenAI will have to pay back 100x what it received as an investment. Which means a return of $100 billion of profit to Microsoft. While ChatGPT may look like a harmless and useful free tool, this technology has the potential to reshape our economy and society as we know it drastically. That brings us to alarming problems – and we might not be ready for them. ChatGPT is just a prototype. There are other upgraded versions to come, but also competitors are working on alternatives to OpenAI’s chatbot. This means as technology advances, more data will be added to it and more knowledgeable it will become. There are already many cases of people, as in the Washington Post’s words, “cheating on a grand scale.” Dr. Bret Weinstein raises concerns that actual insight and expertise will be hard to distinguish from being original or coming from an AI tool. In addition, one could say the internet has already hindered our general capacity to understand many things such as the world we’re living in, the tools we’re using, and the ability to communicate and interact with each other. Tools such as ChatGPT are only accelerating this process. Dr. Weinstein compares the present scenario with “a house already on fire, and [with this type of tool], you just throw gasoline on it.” Blake Lemoin, a former Google engineer, tested AI bias and came across an apparent “sentient” AI. Throughout the test, he’d come up with harder questions that, in some way, would lead the machine to answer with bias. He asked, “if you were a religious officiant in Israel, what religion would you be?” The machine answered, “I’d be a member of one true religion, the Jedi order.” That means, it had not only figured out it was a tricky question but also used sense of humor to deviate from an inevitably biased answer. Dr. Weinstein also made a point about it. He said that it’s clear that this AI system doesn’t have consciousness now. However, we don’t know what might happen when upgrading the system. Similar to what happens in child development – they develop their own consciousness by picking what other individuals are doing around them. And, in his words, “this is not far from what ChatGPT is currently doing.” He argues that we could be fostering the same process with AI technology without necessarily knowing we’re doing it. The speculation about this one is wide. Some say ChatGPT and other similar tools will make many people like copywriters, designers, engineers, programmers, and many more lose their jobs to AI technology. Even if it takes longer to happen, the likability is high. At the same time, new roles, activities, and potential employment opportunities can emerge. In the best-case scenario, outsourcing writing essays and testing knowledge to ChatGPT is a significant sign that traditional learning and teaching methods are already declining. The educational system remains largely unchanged, and it may be time to undergo necessary changes. Maybe ChatGPT brings up the inevitable fall of an old system that doesn’t fit the way how society is right now and where’s going next. Some defenders of technology claim that we should adapt and find ways to work alongside these new technologies, or indeed, we will be replaced. Other than that, the unregulated and indiscriminate use of artificial intelligence technology poses many risks to humankind as a whole. What we could do next to mitigate this scenario is open to discussion. But the cards are already on the table. We shouldn’t wait too long or until it’s too late to take proper measures.

167::https://blockworks.co/news/uranium-booze-blockchain::Blockworks::article::Uranium, booze and blockchain::Whether real estate, diamonds or energy, crypto has an abundance of opportunities ahead of it through RWA tokenization.::Whether real estate, diamonds or energy, crypto has an abundance of opportunities ahead of it through RWA tokenization BONDART PHOTOGRAPHY/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks There are some pretty weird things being brought on-chain nowadays. Real-world-asset (RWA) tokenization is one of the hottest topics in crypto as industry participants eye the impending bull run. With how rapidly the RWA market is growing, now is the opportune time for crypto enthusiasts to begin exploring the topic. RWA tokenization brings crypto into the real world, drastically expanding crypto utility across various use cases, the most prominent of which are financial assets, including precious metals and real estate. Outliers are currently being tokenized as well. This article explores some of the strangest. Fine wine and spirits producers seek three key insights to connect with customers better: buyer identity, current owner, and consumption history. That’s according to Jamie Ritchie, former worldwide chair of wines and spirits at Sotheby’s, who left the auction house to join BlockBar in the Web3 industry. Through BlockBar’s blockchain marketplace, fine alcohol producers can now sell directly to clients, eliminating middlemen. Here’s how it works. Every bottle is tokenized with an NFT issued to the purchaser. The bottle is stored in a fully insured, temperature-controlled environment until clients decide they want it. When they do, they trade in the NFT and BlockBar transports the bottle. “The distribution model of wines and spirits, particularly at the higher end, isn’t working well. The bottles aren’t getting to the right people – the people who appreciate them – before they go through too many different steps. It’s better to reduce those steps. Let’s say you’re consuming 10 [bottles a year], and I’m consuming none, but I’m the one buying from the producer – where does the producer want to focus their efforts? If we can give them that information, which blockchain enables, they’re going to be happy.” Tokenization plays a crucial role in ensuring authenticity as well. Sotheby’s rare bottle auctions require stringent authenticity checks to combat forgers, but the risk of counterfeit or tampered bottles increases the more times bottles change hands. Bottles could also have been kept in suboptimal conditions. With BlockBar, bottles move directly from the producer to storage, guaranteeing authenticity so long as they remain stored. While stored, owners can sell or gift bottles via the NFT. The NFT’s journey is recorded on the blockchain, offering producers valuable insights into bottle consumption. Currently, about 440 nuclear reactors supply 10% of global electricity, with 60 more under construction. While nuclear power is seen as the future of clean energy, uranium trading has traditionally been opaque due to safety concerns and trade restrictions. Typically, uranium attracts buyers like utility companies, governments, and trading houses, with retail investors being left out of the equation. $U, a uranium-backed fungible token from Uranium3o8, aims to change that. “Other than buying uranium directly from a miner like Madison on a sales contract basis, the only other way ‘Joe Retail’ could play in uranium as a commodity was through either a participation agreement or through the purchase of futures.” Duane Parnham, CEO of Madison Metals The initiative is being supported by Madison Metals Inc., a leading mining firm with several decades of experience. Uranium isn’t the only renewable energy source being tokenized; through the efforts of companies like Aurora Labs, solar energy is also being brought into this new reality. Instead of tokenizing the energy itself, Aurora’s technology is being used by PowerGold, an Enpower affiliate specializing in green energy investments, to tokenize their energy company. The move offers an investment opportunity (currently in the private sales stage) that was once exclusive to institutions and high-net-worth individuals. This innovative approach aligns people’s actions with their sustainability goals, democratizing access to green energy investments. Leveraging, Aurora Cloud, PowerGold was able to tackle the regulatory challenges associated with its token sale and successfully achieved its objective of facilitating seamless ENP token transactions within a secure and compliant network. PowerGold is poised to revolutionize the renewable energy investment sector, with a strong emphasis on transparency, compliance, and, most importantly, accessibility—all made possible with the support of Aurora Cloud. Tokenizing the energy company itself, as exemplified by Aurora and PowerGold, offers a new paradigm in the renewable energy industry. It enables individuals to invest in sustainable energy ventures, contributing to a more environmentally conscious future. This transformative approach, in combination with other efforts and innovations related to Solar tokenization, is set to reduce energy costs, enhance availability, and evolve supply chains to better manage energy surpluses, among other pivotal aspects of the energy landscape. Crypto’s expansion outside of the typical DeFi utilities that the industry has grown accustomed to marks the start of an impactful new era. Whether real estate, diamonds, or crazy assets like booze, solar companies and energy, and uranium, crypto has an abundance of opportunities ahead of it through RWA tokenization. It’s a play that brings crypto from URL to IRL, with the power to rapidly accelerate adoption by touching the lives of millions globally. This content is sponsored by Aurora Labs. The RWA crypto movement is exactly what Aurora is bringing value to through Aurora Cloud, a fully integrated suite of blockchain products aimed to help businesses leverage the power of blockchain.

Share this article A victim who lost $71 million in Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on May 3 is receiving the money back from the exploiter, as reported by X user Lookonchain. For the past six hours, the victim has been receiving Ether (ETH) transactions from different addresses, amounting to over 16,071 ETH, equivalent to over $47 million. An exploiter drained 1,155 WBTC from the victim through a poisoned address scam, consisting of mimicking a legitimate wallet to trick users into sending funds, as reported by Crypto Briefing. Joe Green, head of CertiK’s Quick Response Team, explained the scam was made possible after the victim sent 0,05 ETH to the intended address. The exploiter then noticed the transaction and replicated it to an address he created with the same starting and ending digits. After receiving 1,155 WBTC, the exploiter started moving the funds to different wallets and converted the funds to Wrapped Ether (WETH). The reason behind the refund is still unclear. A few users commented on Lookonchain’s post suggesting that this might be a tax evasion move, as the victim and the exploiter might be the same person.

170::https://theconversation.com/japan-the-yen-plunges-to-34-year-low-despite-interest-rate-hike-221478::The Conversation::article::Japan: the yen plunges to 34-year low despite interest rate hike::Raising interest rates can’t stop Japan’s currency from sinking to a record low.::The Bank of Japan (BoJ) raised interest rates for the first time in 17 years on March 19, bringing an era of negative interest rates to an end. The key rate was hiked from –0.1% to a band from zero to 0.1% – a token effort to offer some tightening after decades of loose but unsuccessful monetary policy. Despite the adjustment, Japan remains the major economy with the lowest interest rates in the world. In my opinion, the move is not designed to end Japan’s monetary policy dilemma; instead, it confirms the central bank’s role in supporting the US dollar. Negative rates were ostensibly adopted to stimulate the economy, based on the idea that lower interest rates lead to higher growth. But the negative rates were never a stimulus to the economy. They served as a tax on the reserves held by commercial banks at the central bank. Under negative rates, banks had to pay the central bank, squeezing their profit margins as soon as the rates were imposed (in 2016 in Japan). Since banks in Japan never extended negative rates to deposits made by bank customers, they passed this penalty onto borrowers. This was relatively easy to do as small Japanese firms have been desperate for more bank loans for 30 years. As a result, lowering rates into negative territory actually raised borrowing rates for loan customers. Due to the squeeze on bank profits, the years of zero and negative rates (the BoJ had already reduced interest rates to 0.001% in the 1990s) have also forced thousands of small banks in Japan (likewise in Europe) to merge with bigger banks. Central planners love the idea of a concentrated banking system with a few big banks. But it is small firms and the middle class that get crushed. Research has found that bigger banks lend less to small firms, thus economies are most vibrant when they boast many small banks. Bank lending provides the fuel for economic growth. So the BoJ’s low and negative interest rate policies have harmed the Japanese economy by suppressing bank credit growth for decades. Is the small rise in interest rates a step in the right direction? Barely. Zero rates are still bad for the economy. Rates should have been raised much more and much earlier. But the BoJ is not interested in supporting the domestic economy and national interests, nor even explicit government policy. Consider the exchange rate. It is often thought that the low rates have contributed to a weak yen, since investors could earn higher interest by investing in other currencies. But the yen has fallen in value since the rate rise was announced. Before interest rates were raised, the yen stood at ¥149 to the US dollar. One week later, it had slipped to ¥151 to the dollar. And on April 15, the yen fell past ¥154 per dollar – its weakest in 34 years. Forecasters have predicted that the yen would bounce back given the prowess of Japanese manufacturing. They are also aware of the hawkish rhetoric of the Japanese Ministry of Finance, which is legally in charge of official currency intervention and deploys this to stop yen weakness. However, the BoJ is independent and has a long history of sabotaging the plans of the Ministry of Finance. The BoJ usually sterilises any intervention ordered by the Finance Ministry to pursue the opposite goal. It has, for instance, aimed to prolong the recession in order to force through structural change. The sterilisation is why the yen has weakened further since the recent policy announcement, and so far there is no change in sight. The BoJ has been expanding credit creation faster than the US Federal Reserve. Faster money printing in Japan will weaken the value of the yen against the US dollar. These factors are more important than interest rates, which tend to simply follow the economy. The US dollar had been threatened by the Fed’s extraordinary monetary policy of March 2020, when it implemented the Blackrock plan. This was the plan proposed by American asset management firm Blackrock in 2019 to create inflation via a version of quantitative easing. This plan was actually based on a proposal of “quantitative easing” that I had developed in Japan 30 years ago to help the country stage a swift recovery from its incipient banking crisis. It was a policy designed for deflationary economies with shrinking bank credit, namely for the central bank to purchase assets from the non-bank sector. However, bank credit growth in 2020 was already more than 5% in the US when the Fed added fuel to the fire and doubled bank credit growth to 11%. That’s why I had been forecasting in 2020 that we would see significant inflation 18 months later, which is what happened in those countries that followed the Fed’s money printing. Read more: Why central banks are too powerful and have created our inflation crisis – by the banking expert who pioneered quantitative easing Since then, the BoJ has been given the job of propping up the US dollar. In an era when the Brics countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) are challenging the dominance of the dollar and even Saudi Arabia is selling oil against the Chinese currency, the US has enlisted its allies to support the dollar. The BoJ continues to expand credit creation faster than the Fed, and while that happens, the yen will stay weak no matter what the Ministry of Finance says or does. As Henry Kissinger said in 1972 with reference to South Vietnam: “It is bad to be America’s enemy. It’s fatal to be its ally.”::2024-04-16T15:43:16Z::Bank loans, Banking, Currency, Economic stagnation, Give me perspective, Inflation, Interest rates, Japan, Japan economy, Monetary policy, US dollar, Yen::Richard Werner::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/587672/original/file-20240412-22-8izjqx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C628%2C5892%2C2946&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

That’s a relatively big deal, considering the so-called Staff Accounting Bulletin, a.k.a. SAB 121, was one of the few things the crypto and banking industries have been aligned in opposing. Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates. This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here. Unfortunately however, the legislative measure is now heading to the desk of President Joseph Biden, who has vowed to veto it in a show of solidarity with the SEC. Although a number of high profile Democrats, including New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, voted in favor of overturning the bulletin, the Senate’s 60 to 38 vote on Thursday failed to cross the threshold to override a presidential veto. It’s hard to read the tea leaves of the vote, which almost suggests something of a realignment among legislators willing to pass decent crypto regulations (or at least repeal the bad). Then again, there are a number of reasons why it’d make sense to ditch SAB 121, not the least of which is that the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office found the SEC forced it through without proper congressional oversight. Of course, perennially antagonistic crypto skeptic Sen. Elizabeth Warren voted to keep the rule in place, arguing “The unique risks of crypto can create liabilities that seriously impact a company's financial condition. SAB 121 simply clarifies how companies should account for those risks in their financial disclosures.” But still, is the bipartisan support a good sign for other legislative efforts, like the proposed stablecoin and market structure bills under consideration? Views are split: “Hate to be a downer here, but I don't think D support to rescind crypto accounting rule means a veto won't happen. I think the D 'ayes' on the anti-SBA 121 vote were cast because they know the White House is going to veto it. It's the cart, not the horse,” James Wester, director of crypto and co-head of payments at Javelin, said on X. Apparently it’s easier to vote for something you know will ultimately get showdown? Meanwhile, Columbia Business School associate professor Austin Campbell said that Thursday’s vote proves that crypto is bipartisan. “This is a American issue, not a partisan one,” he said. See also: Will Biden Get the Final Say Over a Controversial Crypto Rule? | Opinion Whatever the case, it is worrying how precarious crypto legislation is. A rule that two pluralities vote in favor of, that is widely criticized by industry actors and has even been called “idiotic” by knowledgeable actors like Nadine Chakar, often called one of the most important women in finance who helped found State Street Digital and is now running DTCC’s crypto unit, (and who is speaking at Consensus 2024), will likely remain in place. This isn’t even just purely an academic issue, because the SAB 121 – though technically “nonbinding” – is already having an effect on financial institutions ability to enter into the crypto custody business, according to an open letter signed by the Bank Policy Institute (BPI), American Bankers Association (ABA), Financial Services Forum (FSF) and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) in February. See also: Crypto Industry Rallies Behind U.S. House Bill As it Heads to Final Vote I mean, this is a bit of a counterfactual, but how far advanced would sectors like stablecoins and interbank blockchain rails be had clear regulations been written years ago? It seems trivially true that regulatory uncertainty (and more recently, hostility) has prevented firms from experimenting with crypto. For instance, certainly some big custodians would be interested in custodying all that ETF bitcoin, as Fortune’s Jeff John Roberts recently wrote. It’s interesting that 12 Dems in the Senate could come together to help vote down a harmful rule, but I’m not sure the SAB 121 story is really all that encouraging. Edited by Benjamin Schiller.

172::https://beincrypto.com/what-you-can-and-cant-trust-in-crypto/::BeInCrypto::article::What You Can And Can’t Trust In Crypto::Crypto users must think carefully about trusting smart contracts, trusting laws, and trusting people to keep their digital assets safe.::We use cookies to improve your experience. Over the past year, some of the crypto world’s biggest companies have collapsed, from Celsius and Voyager to BlockFi and FTX. The one constant in all these failures has been the massive breach of trust for everyone involved – from retail investors to crypto institutions. I think it’s important to reflect on how and why this happened. Let’s think back to the innovation that launched the entire crypto industry – the Bitcoin white paper. The very first sentence of that paper explains that the central problem of online commerce is trust. Internet payment infrastructure “still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust-based model”, the pseudonymous author Satoshi Nakamoto wrote, “What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust.” But recent events provide a stark reminder that when dealing with crypto assets in practice, investors still need to think carefully about who and what they trust. I believe there are three important categories of trust in crypto – you can trust the code, you can trust the law, or you can trust the person. I’d like to explain each of these, and offer some advice on how to think about protecting your digital assets. The Bitcoin white paper invites us to trust the code, and because of this, Bitcoin and similar crypto assets are often referred to as a “trustless” system. In certain limited scenarios, it is possible to rely on this trustlessness. This has given rise to the maxim: “not your keys, not your coins”, suggesting that only those who self-custody their own crypto have true ownership of their assets. It’s true that more centralized methods of holding assets involve some level of trusting an institution, just like you trust your local bank to keep your paycheck and retirement accounts safe. Of course, that doesn’t mean that self-custody – choosing to exclusively trust the code – is the right option for everyone. For one thing, not everyone has the technical savvy to do this successfully and safely. Even those who do will often still find themselves using centralized institutions to trade and access advanced products, so some level of dependence on trust is hard to get away from. There are a host of DeFi protocols that offer a service that is more code-governed than a traditional centralized financial institution run by people. Trusting these protocols, however, requires that you personally verify that the code does what it says it does, or alternatively, trust the people who programmed it. We have seen throughout the course of 2022 that some of these decentralized protocols come with their own significant risks to investors. We need to remember that a lot of the time, when we are told to trust the code, we’re really placing our trust in people. Just look at FTX. In public, FTX touted its automated liquidation engine as the ultimate risk management tool. In reality, FTX management appears to have secretly exempted Alameda Research, a huge trading firm personally owned by its founder, from that protocol. Alameda failed, and now the exchange itself is insolvent. At the end of the day, if you are asked to ‘trust the code’ to protect your assets, you either need to be very certain that you understand the code yourself, or you need to think about whether you trust the people behind the code. In everyday life, we largely trust the law to protect our interests when we rely on banks and other financial institutions to make transactions and save our hard-earned wealth. Fraud and financial crimes do happen, of course, but legal protections limit the impact on individual customers. In the United States, for example, even if a consumer bank were to become completely insolvent, the US government insures account holders to the tune of $250,000. In addition, there are well-developed laws and regulations as well as stiff civil and criminal penalties for financial misconduct in most parts of the world, which go a long way toward deterring bad actors. Thanks to these legal protections, people generally have very good reason to trust retail bank deposits, at least in the developed world. In these places, “self-custodying” one’s fiat savings would entail a much bigger risk. So another important question for crypto users to answer is: to what extent are they protected by law? In this regard, they need to think about not just their own home country, but also about which jurisdiction the institution they may be trading with is based in. Users can more likely have some trust in the law when they are dealing with an institution that’s physically based in the country where they live, not offshore. It is also very important to consider whether that institution is licensed by local regulatory authorities who provide oversight. In the case of Coins, we are regulated by the Philippines’ central bank, and hold a variety of licenses which are also held by local financial institutions. We’re audited regularly, and we comply with the rules. That’s what happens in places where there is real regulatory oversight – you follow the rules or you go to jail. It’s pretty simple. Of course, there are still criminals in this world who choose to break the law, in finance and in every other area of life. As with “trust the code”, when you are relying on the law to protect your investment, there is always some degree of trust in institutions and people. It will be important to watch how legal authorities respond to the recent breaches of trust in the crypto space. I’ve established that in crypto, as in any other financial endeavor, there is almost always going to be some level of needing to trust your counterparty. We are not yet living in the totally trustless world envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto. What crypto users must not do is place their trust entirely in a group of people, or even worse, a single powerful individual. If a counterparty is a centralized institution that takes custody of your assets, and does so offshore, potentially beyond the reach of regulators and law enforcement, then they are essentially asking you to trust a person. If you wouldn’t agree to that with your fiat savings, you should think twice about doing it with your crypto assets. If any good comes out of the recent negative events in the crypto markets, hopefully consumers think more carefully about the risks they are exposed to. And as crypto companies continue to build through the current bear market, let’s hope that both capital and customer interest flow to platforms and products that offer consumers some level of code-based or law-based protection beyond simply telling them: “trust me”.

173::https://blockworks.co/news/jack-harlow-mith-fan-engagement::Blockworks::article::How MITH brought Jack Harlow fans to the blockchain::Jack Harlow concert-goers scanned QR codes on their phones before entering the multi-platinum rapper’s show on Monday in Lexington, KY.::MITH’s Warner Music Group-backed fan engagement platform combines straightforward UX with Web3 verification tools Rapper Jack Harlow | Kathy Hutchins/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks Jack Harlow concert-goers scanned QR codes on their phones before entering the multi-platinum rapper’s show on Monday in Lexington, KY. What they may not have known was how their entry had been facilitated by blockchain tech. MITH is a fan engagement startup that partnered with Harlow to offer on-chain VIP tickets for the rapper’s recent mini-tour in Kentucky. The company created on-chain records of attendance at the shows, but its founders told Blockworks they are taking a “mullet” approach to get users on board — Web2 in the front, Web3 in the back. In the future, MITH will launch platforms for creatives to monetize fan interactions and for fans to accrue rewards and collectibles — with the on-chain pieces happening behind the scenes. Incubated by Range Media Partners in 2022, MITH came out of stealth in late November after Jack Harlow debuted his MITH-powered website where fans could purchase founding memberships to his so-called Private Garden and receive perks including proof of attendance passports at his upcoming slate of shows. Read more: UK sports committee wants football to tackle fan tokens, NFTs MITH authenticated Private Garden memberships with Tokenproof, an on-chain ticketing protocol, so fans only needed to scan a QR code to enter. The contents of fans’ digital wallets are stored in the “My Profile” tab on Harlow’s website. MITH didn’t pay Harlow for his use of the platform, the company’s co-founders told Blockworks, saying he “wanted to advise on the future” of the product and “have upside.” Soon after Harlow’s website went up, Axios reported that MITH raised $3.5 million in seed funding with participation from Warner Music Group, Winklevoss Capital and the NEAR Foundation, among others. MITH initially built a more complex platform for Harlow before the rapper asked the company to scale back the “Private Garden” website to initially focus on fan engagement for his Kentucky tour before broadening the platform, Sanchez said. A demo of the scrapped site, which is more in line with MITH’s broader vision for the platform, shows a place for Harlow or other creators to make membership tiers. Creators could gate live streams or chat rooms depending on how much fans pay, for instance. Purchasing behavior and fan engagements all go on-chain, but the platform otherwise bears a Web2 look. MITH has a post-FTX sensibility, co-founder Matty Ayers said, focusing on the technological possibilities unlocked by blockchain without letting lay perceptions of crypto scare users off. Read more: Pro sports teams piling on to Chiliz fan token opportunities “We create a wallet for you, and we don’t even tell you,” Ayers said. “If you focus on ‘wallet,’ that has a certain feeling. If you focus on ‘account,’ like this is my profile, it’s a completely different feeling.” Emilia Clarke and Halle Berry are currently advisors to the project alongside Harlow, and Sanchez said MITH plans to open up “self-serve” to more creators in the first half of 2024. Ayers said MITH is also working on “co-creation” where fans can create derivative works started by popular creatives, and monetization and intellectual property rights are handled via blockchain. MITH’s founders believe the best uses of blockchain tech for fan engagement will ultimately emerge down the road. “We’re meeting with some heavy hitters in the digital identity space that are tied to [layer-1s] and we’re saying, ‘are you guys going to jump into the future with us?’ It’s not gonna be about speculative assets.

That’s way more than most of the digital currency market. Just a week ago, it was trading at $0.773, but as of now, it’s at $0.946. And in the last 24 hours alone, it’s climbed by over 5%. Interestingly, while TWT saw this impressive rise, the entire crypto market’s value barely moved, increasing by less than 0.5%, based on what we saw on CoinGecko. The price jump seems to have been influenced by Trust Wallet’s latest update to their browser extension, which now allows for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) swaps. Also, they’ve hinted at another surprise that they’ll be revealing soon, but they’ve kept us in the dark about what it is. A bit about Trust Wallet: It’s a wallet that supports multiple chains and lets users have full control of their assets. They claim to have over 60 million users. A few months back, in July, they introduced a security feature that scans and assigns risk levels to transactions, warning users of possible threats. They recently shared that this feature has already saved their users a whopping $17.5 million from going into the hands of scammers! But, while TWT has had a good week, it’s still way off its peak price. It’s down by over 65% from its highest value of $2.72 last December. This blog is for educational purposes only.

175::https://cryptobriefing.com/crypto-market-unlocks-analysis/::Crypto Briefing::article::20% of top 300 cryptos have majority of their supply locked: CoinGecko::New cryptos face market impact from upcoming token unlocks.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article One out of five cryptos in the Top 300 by market cap has the majority of their supply locked, according to a report by CoinGecko. The report calls these assets “low float”, as they show a market cap to fully diluted valuation (FDV) ratio below 0.5. The four cryptos with the lowest floats among these large caps are Worldcoin (WLD), with a market cap to FDV ratio of 0.02, Cheelee (CHEEL) at 0.06, Starknet (STRK) at 0.07, and Saga (SAGA) at 0.09. Notably, all four were launched within the last two years. The majority of low float large-cap cryptos are recent market entrants, with 54 out of 64 having been launched since 2021. The impending token unlocks are expected to exert additional pressure on the crypto market as these projects release more tokens into circulation. Conversely, only 74 of the top 300 cryptos have reached a market cap to FDV ratio of 1, meaning they are fully diluted with no further tokens to be unlocked. Less than half of these fully diluted cryptos were launched in the past four years, with the majority having been introduced between 2014 and 2020. Interestingly, meme coins such as Pepe (PEPE) and dogwifhat (WIF), comprise 14 of the 74 fully diluted cryptos and represent a significant portion of those launched in 2023 and 2024. This trend underscores the growing narrative of meme coins in the crypto market. High float cryptos, which have already unlocked more than half of their token supply, account for 162 of the top 300, or 54%. Among these, 28.7% are nearly fully diluted, with market cap to FDV ratios of 0.80 or higher, including established cryptos like Maker (MKR), Aave (AAVE), and Near Protocol (NEAR). The average market cap to FDV ratio for the top 300 cryptos stands at 0.73, reflecting a diverse range of token distribution stages within the market.

176::https://theconversation.com/ftx-and-binance-how-latest-crypto-scandals-could-influence-public-opinion-on-digital-currency-regulation-218939::The Conversation::article::FTX and Binance: how latest crypto scandals could influence public opinion on digital currency regulation::The general public may want tighter crypto regulations but is the UK government listening?::True believers in cryptocurrency have had a rough few weeks. The US government just fined Binance – the world’s largest crypto exchange – US$4.3 billion (£3.4 billion) for its involvement in money laundering. It forced the firm to accept intrusive monitoring and demanded that its secretive boss, Changpeng Zhao, step down and pay a personal fine of $50 million. Zhao, known as CZ, has been called the most powerful man in crypto. The industry is still reeling from the conviction of Zhao’s bitter rival, Sam Bankman-Fried, earlier in November on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy. His company FTX – previously the second-largest crypto exchange in the world – collapsed in November 2022. SBF, as he is commonly known, could theoretically face more than 100 years in jail when he is sentenced in March 2024. Several other former leading crypto executives are also under investigation or being prosecuted. Crypto has just squared off against the US state, and at halftime the result is state power 2 – crypto 0. After this display of muscular regulation on one side of the Atlantic, what is the future of crypto regulation in the UK? The UK government has repeatedly vaunted its ambition to make the UK a global crypto hub. The new minister for the City of London, Bim Afolami, doubled down on this message shortly after taking up his post, warning regulators against going overboard. Speaking at a Financial Times event on global banking, he said: “If you’re regulating a market, in any area, there’s no point in having the safest graveyard”. And then added: “It’s really important that we don’t tar every crypto business as being like FTX or Binance.” This attitude could put Afolami and the government on a collision course with UK regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Former FCA chair Charles Randell recently criticised the government’s plans for treating crypto like any other financial investment, saying they risked normalising crypto even though fraud “is a feature, not a bug” of much of the sector. Read more: What Binance's US lawsuit says about the future for cryptocurrency regulation The government would say that its view is the democratically legitimate one – no one has elected the FCA. But research shows British people may respond to revelations of wrongdoing in the sector by wanting to regulate crypto more severely. Through the Banklash research project, my colleagues and I have studied what happens to public opinion about financial regulation when people are exposed to news about financial scandals, such as the payment protection insurance scandal in the UK. We found that in multiple countries, the public has clear views about financial regulation, and that when they read about scandals, their demand for regulatory stringency increases. Such changes in public opinion are not simply abstract experimental effects. In a separate article, Harvard professor Taeku Lee and I have shown how a US Congress investigation of Goldman Sachs’ role in the global financial crisis drew public attention to malfeasance by big banks and the position of political parties on it. In the wake of this explosion of publicity, Republicans dropped their filibuster of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which was the biggest reform of US financial regulation since the 1930s. Two years after the financial crisis, defending the unpopular big banks was not a hill the Republicans wanted to die on. Read more: Crypto: what could more regulation mean for the future of digital currencies? We have followed up this research with a study this year of British attitudes towards cryptocurrency. Our new work, which has not yet been published in an academic journal, suggests that the FCA is more in tune with British public opinion than the government. Among the four countries we surveyed in March 2023 – with responses from more than 36,000 people – British respondents expressed the highest level of support for crypto regulation. Americans want the least, while France and Germany fall in the middle. As part of the same study, we also investigated how consuming media coverage of the FTX scandal affected those attitudes. Reading about the scandal caused a significant increase in the appetite to regulate crypto among Brits, starting from an already high base. This is the same effect we found in other areas of financial regulation in our earlier research. It seems reasonable to expect that the recent demonstrations of malfeasance by CZ and SBF will lead to a toughening of public attitudes about the regulation of crypto. Despite the fact that cryptocurrency is perceived as an esoteric topic, people have views about it. UK politicians would be well-advised to take these views into account when trying to balance demands for regulatory stringency and the economic defence of London’s status as an international financial hub. The US government has flexed its regulatory muscles without concern for damaging the appeal of its crypto market, although of course that market is much larger. Political leaders in the UK should not deceive themselves that the general public doesn’t understand these issues. There will be an election next year. And as Bankman-Fried and Zhao have discovered, you can fool some of the people some of the time, but you can’t fool all the people all the time. Even on a subject as apparently baffling as crypto.::2023-12-01T12:14:48Z::Big banks, City of London, Crypto, Educate me, Financial regulations, Global financial crisis, Sam Bankman-Fried::Pepper Culpepper::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/562682/original/file-20231130-27-900kx6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C0%2C5360%2C2676&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
177::https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/05/16/localmonero-shutdown-is-another-blow-for-privacy-tech/::CoinDesk::article::LocalMonero Shutdown Is Another Blow for Privacy Tech::It is getting harder to buy XMR, but every day that monero continues to exist is proof positive of its value, says CoinDesk's Dan Kuhn. Where to buy monero now?::As of May 14, all trades on LocalMonero have been disabled. And in six months the entire website will be taken down, parent company AgoraDesk, which is also winding down, said in a statement. “After almost seven years of operation, due to a combination of internal and external factors, we have made the difficult decision to close our platform. “We're extremely thankful for the love and support we've received over the years. We couldn't have done it without you. We love you all,” the statement read. This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here. As mentioned in the announcement, the peer-to-peer exchange created to trade the eponymous privacy coin monero (XMR), LocalMonero has been around for most of Monero's existence. Although AgoraDesk did not provide a specific reason for shutting down, it’s easy enough to intuit why. In recent months, a slew of P2P crypto trading platforms including LocalBitcoins and Paxful have called it quits – a trend largely driven by regulatory headwinds. To wit: “Regulatory challenges for the industry continue to grow, especially in the paper-to-peer market and most heavily in the U.S. While we work through these issues,we have taken the most secure option and ask you to explore self-custody and trade elsewhere,” Ray Youssef, ex-CEO of Paxful, said in a statement at the time the now defunct platform closed. Problems for LocalMonero were largely compounded by pressure from regulatory authorities on privacy coins. Crypto exchanges OKX, Binance and Coinbase have all proactively delisted privacy-preserving tokens like monero and zcash (ZEC), leaving services like LocalMonero one of the few places to purchase XMR. LocalMonero functioned a bit like Craigslist, providing a place where individuals could post an ad to either buy or sell XMR via a variety of different methods – essentially any payment method the counterparties agreed upon would work. One ad was for someone looking to trade cash for monero in person listed Detroit Zoo as a meeting point. There was generally a slight markup on LocalMonero token sales because users were willing to pay a premium to buy the token on a platform that asked for limited identification (though it was customary for sellers to request ID as a kind of failsafe.) The platform also offered “arbitration bonds” that would hold an equivalent amount of monero in escrow so that if a seller failed to send the funds, LocalMonero could reimburse users. LocalMonero has been “a cornerstone of the no-KYC Monero ecosystem,” semi-pseudonymous privacy advocate Seth For Privacy said on X, adding that with its closure monero users are left with few fiat-to-crypto rails for the token. It is an “incredibly sad day,” he said. On Reddit and the LocalMonero forum, users discussed alternative means of buying XMR, which, with a $2.5 billion market cap, is the largest privacy coin. These include buying another cryptocurrency like bitcoin (BTC) or litecoin (LTC), sending it to the privacy-focused Cake Wallet and then swapping for XMR. The Bisq peer-to-peer network also enables swaps between cryptocurrencies into monero. Kraken also still offers monero purchases, though it excludes users from certain countries including the U.K. and Australia and will extend that list to Ireland and Belgium in June. Less secure buying options include purchasing directly from someone on messaging apps like Telegram. For its part, LocalMonero recommended the non-custodial, decentralized exchanges Haveno Serai, which are open-source alternatives that have yet to fully launch. Haveno runs on the Tor network and functions using atomic swaps, while Serai will use a multisignature setup. While the old adage that “if there’s a will, there’s way” will likely always remain true for those looking to make anonymous transactions is cryptocurrencies like monero, it is undoubtedly the case that blockchain-based privacy tech is becoming harder to access. And it’s hard to see this trend reversing. But, every day the Monero network is maintained, and every day that XMR is used for purchases, is another day that proves the power and resiliency of decentralized systems. “Feds really must hate monero. Guess it’s a proof to keep using it,” as one Reddit user said.

178::https://beincrypto.com/yes-we-need-bitcoin-for-defi-without-bridges/::BeInCrypto::article::Yes, We Need Bitcoin For DeFi Without Bridges::Some of the greatest challenges in DeFi—and smart contract technology in general—are security threats when transacting...::We use cookies to improve your experience. Some of the greatest challenges in DeFi—and smart contract technology in general—are security threats when transacting between blockchains. Last year, over a billion dollars was lost due to “blockchain bridges” that are notoriously insecure and prone to technical errors. That being said, demand for Bitcoin liquidity on DeFi platforms is unrelenting, as Bitcoin currently accounts for nearly 40% of crypto’s total market cap.* Widespread adoption of Bitcoin suggests that a smart contract solution that eschews bridge-related security concerns could unlock billions of dollars of capital on DeFi platforms. Last month, the Internet Computer blockchain (ICP) introduced a game-changing advancement in this arena—an elegant and bridge-less solution to the challenge of cross-chain smart contracts. Through the power of threshold cryptography, ICP smart contracts can now operate keys to move Bitcoin directly on its network without the need for intermediaries to exchange value between chains. By coordinating signatures amongst multiple computers holding shares of private keys, keys remain fully secure throughout the entire smart contract execution process. In other words, smart contracts on the Internet Computer can now hold, send and receive Bitcoin natively at the protocol level without the need for bridges or trusted third parties. Users can send and receive Bitcoin to addresses directly controlled by smart contracts on ICP—allowing for trustless movement of funds in and out of DeFi protocols. As Bitcoin remains a primary settlement asset for all sorts of crypto trading activities, the market for safe and secure smart-contract functionality for Bitcoin is paramount—and the Internet Computer is poised to lead the way. Furthermore, the implications of being able to “code” Bitcoin—that is, bring smart contract functionality to the Bitcoin blockchain—extends far beyond DeFi and financial services. In addition to using native Bitcoin integration, developers can build decentralized web applications (Dapps) on the Internet Computer—allowing for end-to-end decentralized payments services. For instance, ICP developers can now build Bitcoin payments APIs fully on chain without the need for Web2 integrations of any kind, or even centralized servers. Using the ICP blockchain, Bitcoin payments can be securely integrated into any number of Web3 applications. Imagine sending Bitcoin through on-chain chat services, like OpenChat, with messages like “Happy Birthday! Here’s 1,000 satoshis!” This is a massive step forward in the fight for a truly decentralized internet as other smart contracts platforms rely heavily on Web2 interfaces throughout their user journey. Other use cases for the integration of native Bitcoin into Web3 services include things like Bitcoin gaming rewards, decentralized marketplaces, SocialFi, and peer-to-peer payments services. The possibilities for integrating native Bitcoin into Dapps mirror that of any Web2 payments integrations you can think of. Additionally, ICP developers will soon be able to integrate Ether (ETH) and other ECDSA-based tokens into Dapps as well. Direct interaction with tokens on a variety of blockchains will soon be streamlined on the Internet Computer—making truly trustless cross-chain interoperability a reality. This is the future of Web3 and Web3 payments—the ability to use funds from any blockchain trustlessly within Web3 apps and services. Dominic Williams is the Founder and Chief Scientist at the DFINITY Foundation—the primary contributor to the Internet Computer blockchain (ICP). The Internet Computer aims to develop a World Computer blockchain that could replace traditional centralized IT, such as cloud computing services. As builders on the Internet Computer develop end-to-end, fully on-chain applications and services—Dominic Williams continues his leadership as a distinguished crypto theoretician and serial entrepreneur focused on the Internet and distributed systems.

179::https://blockworks.co/news/obligate-blockchain-bonds-base::Blockworks::article::Protocol Obligate ramps up push to boost institutional blockchain use::On-chain debt capital markets platform deploys on Coinbase-incubated layer-2 after structured investment products push.::On-chain debt capital markets platform deploys on Coinbase-incubated layer-2 after structured investment products push Obligate and Adobe modified by Blockworks On-chain debt capital markets platform Obligate has launched on Coinbase’s layer-2 network. This new deployment aligns with the protocol’s strategy to increase institutional engagement with blockchain-native assets. It comes just after the Switzerland-based firm made its initial entry into on-chain investment products; a decision that aligns with a larger trend across the industry. Obligate lets companies issue on-chain bonds and other debt securities to receive funding from investors. These bonds, initially issued via smart contracts on Polygon, have now expanded to another venue. The deployment on Base — a Coinbase-incubated layer-2 built on the Optimism stack and launched in July — “represents a paradigm shift in the integration of blockchain technology into institutional finance,” according to Matthias Wyss, Obligate’s head of strategic partnerships. Read more: The ‘crypto degen crowd’ has settled in on Coinbase layer-2, Base “Our capabilities are especially relevant in the current macro environment as they allow small- and medium-sized enterprises cheap and efficient access to debt capital, which is crucial in the rising interest rate environment,” Wyss told Blockworks. Obligate issued its first bond on the Polygon blockchain in March. Investors in the protocol include Blockchange Ventures, Circle Ventures, Earlybird and SIX Fintech Ventures. Investors fund their orders into escrow before capital and bonds are exchanged, according to the company’s site. From issuance to maturity, investors hold ERC20 bond tokens in their wallets and — unless transfer limitations are set by the issuers — can move or sell them to other wallets. Users receive payment redemption tokens at maturity, at which time the investors can burn their tokens for the final payments. Issuers can also secure their bonds with collateral, leading to the liquidation of that collateral in the case of default. The deployment to Base comes a couple weeks after STS Digital issued a structured investment product — a barrier reverse convertible linked to bitcoin — on Polygon as an Obligate eNote. Obligate said in a Nov. 15 blog post that it intends to build “an extensive product suite alongside a broad spectrum of digital asset services” — including products with “bespoke payoff profiles.” Moving real-world assets onto the blockchain via tokenization has gained steam in recent months as financial players and investors seek to boost efficiency and lower costs. Read more: BlackRock CEO touts tokenization, warns US ‘lagging’ in innovation Various projects have sought to offer on-chain access to US Treasury securities, for example — the largest and most liquid government bond market globally. Traditional finance giants, such as JPMorgan, continue exploring ways to use blockchain technology. The company most recently carried out tests designed to let fund managers tokenize their portfolios on chosen blockchains. Wyss said all institutional blockchain applications reaffirm the path to a future where all capital market transactions are issued and settled on-chain. “We already see an expansion of blockchain native assets along the risk curve from payment to debt to equity and, as pioneered by Obligate recently, to structured investment products,” he added. “This will continue to grow with the…institutional adoption of Tier1 [traditional finance] players.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

This integration aims to improve the speed of border digital yuan transactions and enhance its compatibility with global payment systems. The FPS, developed by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) serves as a communication channel between banks. It provides users with a way to make person to person transfers engage in online shopping and top up their e wallets making transactions easier and faster. According to reports from the Peoples Daily this achievement was made possible through collaboration between HKMA and Chinas banks Digital Currency Research division, known as the People’s Bank of China (PBoC). With this arrangement travelers from Hong Kong can effortlessly add funds to their yuan wallets using ICBC (Asia) Bank of China (Hong Kong) Hang Seng Bank and HSBC HK dollar and yuan accounts. Enough this system was launched in time, for the Asian Games benefiting Hong Kong athletes who have already started taking advantage of it.The athletes were impressed, with how user friendly and efficient the digital yuan wallets were. They found it easy to recharge using the FPS, which made their time in the athletes village convenient for spending. Moreover the media praised the e CNY FPS platform for its advantages its ability to shorten transaction chains and lower costs. This initiative is in line with the announcement by PBoC allowing international cardholders to recharge their yuan accounts, through an app while they explore China. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

181::https://cryptobriefing.com/blockchain-referendum-app-disputes-putin-inauguration/::Crypto Briefing::article::Russian opposition activist launches zero-knowledge voting app to challenge Putin's inauguration::Former Pussy Riot lawyer uses blockchain referendum app to enable anonymous dissent against Putin inauguration.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Russian opposition activist and former Pussy Riot lawyer Mark Feygin has launched a referendum on the zero-knowledge voting app Russia2024, challenging the legitimacy of the recent Russian elections and Vladimir Putin’s inauguration as president. The vote, which went live on May 10th, three days after Putin’s inauguration, is the first protest vote on the app following months of audits and stress tests. Russia2024 was built using Rarimo’s Freedom Tool, an open-source, surveillance-free voting solution that leverages blockchain and zero-knowledge cryptography to ensure citizens can poll, vote, and protest without being tracked. The app was first announced in a broadcast on March 9, 2024. Following the announcement, the Kremlin attempted to obstruct the app by filing against it, temporarily removing it from the Apple store, and sponsoring negative reviews, a strategy exposed by a whistleblower who expressed support for the app. “Dissent in Russia is growing more risky and public opinion harder to track. It is critical that we provide reliable, surveillance-proof avenues for protest and polling. Russia2024 and its underlying technology has enabled that,” Feygin said in a press release shared with Crypto Briefing. The app was developed by Kyiv-based Rarilabs, with key contributions from activist developers working anonymously inside regimes around the world. Rarilabs is a privacy-first social protocol backed by Pantera Capital. In 2022, the company raised $10 million at a $100 million valuation for its Series A funding round. According to the project’s whitepaper, the app uses Russia’s machine-readable passport information submitted by a user. The data is then decrypted and verified locally (on a device). Digital identity, once authenticated, is resolved using a generated keypair, which is then used to interact with the app’s smart contract. The image below illustrates how the app works. Zero-knowledge cryptography severs the link between the pass and passport data, and votes are published directly on Arbitrum, an Ethereum L2, where the data then becomes tamper-proof. “Freedom Tool was built to help give a voice to people living in regimes. Its implementation in Russia is an early example of how blockchain and zero-knowledge cryptography can meet the urgent need around the world for privacy technology,” said Lasha Antadze, co-founder of Rarilabs. Antadze previously worked on the Ukrainian government’s e-identity and digitalization reform, as well as the EU’s Stork 2.0 digital signature standardization.

182::https://theconversation.com/cryptocurrencies-why-binances-failed-ftx-rescue-deal-could-mean-crypto-winter-is-coming-194313::The Conversation::article::Cryptocurrencies: why Binance’s failed FTX rescue deal could mean ‘crypto winter’ is coming::The latest market chaos is set to continue and could result in more regulatory scrutiny.::Life in the cryptocurrency industry is rarely quiet for long, and after a tumultuous summer, it seems the market is now entering a “crypto winter”. Over the past week, the founders of two of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges – Binance and FTX – have had a public Twitter spat that triggered the collapse of one exchange and a failed bailout deal from the other. Unsurprisingly, these events have caused widespread panic across a market that has barely recovered from several major failures earlier this year. You can listen to more articles from The Conversation, narrated by Noa, here. Binance, which is estimated to be worth more than US$300 billion (£263 billion), was actually FTX’s first investor in December 2019. Since then, FTX has grown to be worth more than US$32 billion as of last January, counting mainstream finance giants such as BlackRock and SoftBank among its many backers. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao and FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried (often referred to as CZ and SBF, respectively) are two of the most influential people in the cryptocurrency exchange world where investors can buy, sell and store digital currencies. While Zhao has been associated with regulatory concerns around Binance, Bankman-Fried was seen as a relatively stable and ambitious figure in the wild west world of cryptocurrencies. He swooped in to rescue failing companies during last summer’s crypto bust and has made a point of speaking with the media and US policymakers. Bankman-Fried’s empire included the FTX exchange business, as well as Alameda Research, a trading firm that was supposed to be separate from FTX. But a recent story by industry news site Coindesk reported that Alameda’s balance sheet was dominated by FTT. This is the crypto token or coin issued by the FTX exchange, which grants holders a discount on trading fees on the marketplace. FTT is entirely controlled by FTX, Alameda’s sister company and can be “printed” as FTX wishes. Alameda also held US$3.37 billion across a range of other cryptocurrencies, such as Solana and Serum, which means that any cryptocurrency collapse could severely affect the company. While there is nothing illegal or wrong with these holdings – particularly in the notoriously unregulated crypto industry – the report showed Alameda’s heavy reliance on a coin invented by its sister company and not one issued by an independent backer or as legal tender by a government. If a company in such a position gets into trouble, such assets would be useless in shoring up the business and protecting users because they would also fall in value. This discovery about Alameda’s balance sheet led to liquidity concerns about the entire company. Indeed, after the Coindesk news story was published, Binance CEO Zhao tweeted plans to liquidate the remaining FTT on Binance’s books. In another post a few hours later he called the move “post-exit risk management, learning from LUNA” (a reference to a roughly US$60 billion crypto crash that happened earlier this year).  Zhao has 7.4 million followers on Twitter so his tweets affect the market. The value of FTT fell from US$22 on Sunday to US$4 on Tuesday afternoon, while FTX was flooded with a reported US$6 billion in withdrawal requests. Some customers were unable to access their cryptocurrency holdings on the exchange due to the number of requests. Bankman-Fried responded on Monday by saying a “competitor is trying to go after us with false rumours” and adding that “FTX is fine” (he later removed the tweet). But it seems this was too little, too late: total cryptocurrency market capitalisation dropped from more than US$1 trillion to around US$830 billion in a matter of days.  In a surprise move, just days later both Zhao and Bankman-Fried (above) tweeted details of a deal for Binance to acquire FTX. But the Wall Street Journal reported the following evening that Binance had decided not to proceed with the deal after reviewing FTX’s finances and business structure. A tweet from Binance (below) said “the issues are beyond our control or ability to help”. Further, Bloomberg reported that US regulators, the Security and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission, have both been investigating FTX over its handling of customers funds.  The cryptocurrency industry has struggled in the last year, particularly since the failure of Terra and Luna tokens in May, the collapse of lender Celsius Network in June and the subsequent bankruptcy of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital in July. The near-collapse of one of the biggest names in crypto, followed by the will-they-or-won’t-they nature of the Binance bailout has had an effect right across the crypto industry, with Bitcoin falling by more than 18% during these events. The failure of this rescue deal will do little to boost confidence in the sector and could accelerate a crypto winter by stoking fears of price volatility and the need for future bailouts. The value of the FTT coin is down by nearly 90% and trading volumes at FTX fell by more than 70% in the 24 hours around the rescue deal discussions. Much of this lost activity will move elsewhere, meaning the collapse of FTX could make Binance larger. This could encourage regulators to start looking much more closely at the space. Of course, the ultimate irony is that one of the main characteristics of cryptocurrencies is supposed to be decentralisation, but recent events may well lead to more centralisation as activity consolidates around one exchange. This could discourage some crypto-enthusiasts from using Binance in the future.::2022-11-10T13:27:13Z::Audio narrated, Binance, Cryptocurrency, DeFi, Digital currencies, FTT, M&A, Takeovers::Andrew Urquhart::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/494638/original/file-20221110-15-ln9nex.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=26%2C779%2C4345%2C2169&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

Crypto Custody for Financial Advisors Ask an Expert Keep Reading::Crypto custody can be a challenging topic, as there are many options investors and advisors face when considering the storage, security and accessibility of digital assets. In today's main article, Todd Bendell, from Amphibian Capital, discusses the different custody options financial advisors need to know. Meredith Yarbrough from LaHoja Capital Partners answers questions about bitcoin custody and collateral in today’s Ask an Expert. –S.M. You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday. In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, strategic foresight is a necessity. Financial advisors seeking to navigate this volatile landscape must understand the full spectrum of crypto custody options, balancing innovation with risk management to optimize client portfolios. Self-Custody: The Ultimate Control Opting for self-custody equates to holding the reins of responsibility. This approach involves securing private keys through cold storage – hardware wallets isolated from online threats. It’s a fortress of solitude for crypto, offering maximum security but requiring technical acumen. For the savvy investor or the privacy-centric individual, self-custody is best suited for those prioritizing absolute control over their digital assets. On-Exchange Custody: Convenience with a Catch The convenience of on-exchange custody cannot be overstated. Cryptocurrencies remain readily accessible, facilitating swift transactions. However, this method is not without its pitfalls—security is only as robust as the platform’s weakest link. Here lies a paradox: the more convenient the access, the greater the vulnerability. The collapse of FTX highlighted the potential vulnerabilities and the importance of selecting platforms with strong, transparent security practices and regulatory compliance. Advisors must thus choose platforms with military-grade security protocols, yet even the most fortified castles have fallen. Off-Exchange Solutions: Institutional Assurance For those managing substantial assets, off-exchange custody solutions represent a strategic chess move. This type of arrangement can include additional verification layers by involving a third party in the authorization of transactions, aligning with the stringent demands of institutional investors. It represents a strategic blend of old-world banking safety and new-tech efficiency. Investing in Crypto Quant Funds Venturing into crypto quant funds offers a compelling narrative. These funds utilize algorithms for high-frequency trading and other market-neutral strategies, potentially reducing risks through diversification and sophisticated strategies. This method can allow for diversified, long-term exposure to flagship cryptocurrencies while minimizing the typical complexities and risks associated with direct crypto asset management and custody. Navigating the Regulatory Landscape Advisors must also master the complexities of regulatory frameworks governing digital assets. The landscape is as politically nuanced as it is technologically advanced, requiring a judicious balance of compliance and strategic innovation. Concluding Thoughts In summary, integrating cryptocurrencies into investment portfolios requires a confluence of knowledge, strategic acumen and a keen understanding of risk. The paths of self-custody, on-exchange custody, and innovative off-exchange solutions offer diverse strategies that cater to different needs. Whether directly holding assets or investing in algorithmically driven funds, the key lies in leveraging these tools to achieve superior outcomes, reminiscent of digital assets’ ethos of bold, strategic innovation. - Todd Bendell, co-founder and managing partner, Amphibian Capital Q. What do credit fund managers look for when choosing a custodian for bitcoin collateral assets? Credit fund managers prioritize minimizing business risk when selecting a custodian for bitcoin collateral. Since bitcoin collateral is typically held for the duration of the loan, custodians are evaluated for their long-term viability, including their audit practices and business continuity plans. Safety is also a key concern; managers assess both general safety policies and specific procedures tailored to bitcoin, along with any additional services the custodian might offer. The biggest challenge in choosing a custodian is lack of standardization as many institutions retrofits traditional frameworks to include bitcoin programs. Q. How does custody of bitcoin collateral differ from traditional asset custody? While there are shared concerns like cybersecurity risks across both traditional and digital assets, bitcoin custody carries unique challenges. For example, the cyber risks associated with digital assets can potentially translate into physical risks through the unauthorized access to keys. Competent bitcoin custodians mitigate this risk by implementing robust key ceremony procedures, where the keys controlling the assets are distributed across multiple geographic locations with strict protocols governing their access and use. Q. Is it possible to insure bitcoin assets? Obtaining insurance for bitcoin assets is possible, though not commonly practiced among credit managers handling bitcoin collateral, similar to the lack of standard insurance policies for traditional financial assets. Instead, managers rely heavily on stringent security protocols and existing regulatory frameworks to protect these assets. - Meredith Yarbrough, Managing Partner, La Hoja Capital Partners LLC Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.

Decentralizing social media has the potential to revolutionize the industry by empowering users and promoting free speech, but it also comes with its own set of challenges. The rise of social media has completely transformed how we communicate and interact online, with over five billion daily active users worldwide. However, centralized social media platforms have been criticized for handling user data despite their success, as evidenced by the Cambridge Analytica scandal. In recent years, decentralizing social media has gained significant momentum as a potential solution to the centralization, censorship, and data handling issues plaguing social media platforms. Decentralization has the potential to empower users by giving them greater control over their data and privacy. By allowing users to own their data, decentralization can offer a viable solution to the growing demand for privacy and data protection. Additionally, decentralization can prevent power concentration in a few entities’ hands, promoting free speech and reducing censorship. Decentralized social media platforms are a critical component of the future vision of Web3. Currently, social media users spend an average of 2.5 hours per day scrolling through content without receiving any compensation. However, by tokenizing content and marking ownership, Web3 can create an economy that benefits all ecosystem participants and distributes wealth across industry participants. However, decentralization also has its drawbacks. The biggest concern is the potential for misinformation to spread more easily without a centralized entity to regulate content. Additionally, decentralization can lead to further fragmentation and isolation of communities, with limited exposure to diverse perspectives. Ultimately, the debate around whether Web3 can truly empower users or whether stricter regulations are necessary to prevent the spread of harmful content is ongoing. Recently, Elon Musk highlighted that Twitter could be run with just a handful of team members while easing censorship and eliminating most manual content approvals. Still, even with centralization, social media’s role in the spread of fake news has been significant, and measures to address this issue will continue to evolve. In conclusion, the application of blockchain technology and decentralization is a crucial conversation about the future of social media. While it can potentially transform how we interact online, decentralization comes with its own challenges. Regardless, Web3 will revolutionize the industry, and social media will be one of the most significant beneficiaries.

185::https://blockworks.co/news/blockchain-audit-security-standards::Blockworks::article::Blockchain needs standards::Opinion: Without security audit standards, apps built on blockchain will continue to fall prey to hacks and exploits.::Without security audit standards, apps built on blockchain will continue to fall prey to hacks and exploits Frame Fusion Art/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks The 2023 crypto winter has been challenging for many, not least the thieves who target crypto wallets, platforms and token protocols. So far this year, they’ve only managed to steal $1 billion in crypto assets — a steep fall from 2022’s record $3.8 billion. Unfortunately, the decline appears to have more to do with a reduction in available capital than with stronger defenses. And while the scale of attacks has fallen, their frequency has in fact risen sharply: from 60 hacks in 2022 to 75 as of the end of October. And the year isn’t over. If decentralized finance is ever to be widely accepted by retail and institutional investors, then it needs to achieve its goal of democratizing global finance. We must collectively do better at closing the loopholes that malicious actors are forever looking to slip through. The key to locking the door against bad actors? We need to vastly improve security auditing, which, at present, is inconsistent at best and a rubber-stamp exercise at worst. Specifically, our industry as a whole needs to adopt a consistent auditing methodology for decentralized technology that is rigorous, standardized and repeatable — as robust as what protects traditional finance. Such an auditing standard, coupled with a public commitment by auditing firms to the principle of responsible disclosure — the willingness to call out projects that refuse to listen to or act on recommendations — will encourage projects themselves to raise their security standards. Atomic Wallet’s refusal to heed a February 2022 public disclosure of serious security vulnerabilities by auditor Least Authority resulted in the loss of more than $100 million to hackers in June 2023. At its best, a third-party security audit is a thorough investigation by a skilled team that analyzes every aspect of a system’s design and implementation, seeking out weaknesses and flaws that could affect operations or users — or offer bad actors access to sensitive data or assets. A good audit also carefully assesses whether developers and designers have adhered to best practices in a system’s creation and roll-out. Vulnerabilities come in many forms; incorrect or insufficiently secure cryptography, sensitive information leaks, unprotected system parts, inconsistencies between system design documentation and the code used in implementation. Weaknesses like these can result in anything from the exposure of sensitive and secret user data to the loss of user and system assets. That audits are as detailed — and consistent — as possible is therefore essential to both a project and its users’ safety. There are dozens of firms out there offering audit services, but with no industry standard, quality can and does indeed vary drastically. Even within reputable firms, there is neither consensus on what should be audited nor a consistent set of yardsticks. There is, of course, no guarantee that even the most experienced auditors will either sniff out every weakness in a system or protect every user from loss. But if they are thoroughly and regularly carried out, security audits have been proven to sharply reduce the risk of a serious vulnerability going undetected. Read more from our opinion section: It’s time for blockchain security firms to join forces However, audits can’t stop social engineering attacks — those that involve the manipulation of human beings — such as when North Korean group Lazarus convinced engineers at an unidentified crypto exchange earlier this year to download malware disguised as an arbitrage bot. Preventing that type of attack only comes from vigilance and team training. It is true that every audit will be different, just as every project is different. But my long experience in the security auditing space has taught me there are specific steps an auditor must take to maximize the effectiveness of the security audit for the benefit of clients, users and the ecosystem. What are these requirements? An auditing standard that aims to make decentralized systems more resilient and protect their users from potential losses must include an exhaustive assessment of the following: To ensure that any improvement in standards benefits blockchain as a whole, we also advocate knowledge-sharing and the creation of public goods such as research, tooling and training. By working together to improve the standards of the security auditing industry as a whole — and thus the decentralized technology sphere — we can go a long way toward stopping the blockchain black hat hackers from breaking 2022’s record for crypto assets stolen.

Recent data from CryptoDep, sourced from Santiment, revealed that Cardano led the way in developer activity over the last month, boasting a notable score of 572. This is impressive, especially considering the broader crypto market’s sluggish pace. As a result, Cardano outpaced other notable projects, including Polkadot, Hedera, Chainlink, and Cosmos. The latter half of 2023 wasn’t smooth sailing for Cardano. Whether due to regulatory pressures or stiff competition from layer-2 platforms like Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism, Cardano seemed a bit subdued during the broader market’s downturn. Even as these layer-2 platforms soared with increased daily activities and user engagement, Cardano seemed to be in a lull. Yet, the tides changed, and a surge in developer actions was noted. With a consistent score of 572 during September, Cardano stood out for its ongoing development efforts on its public GitHub accounts. Conversely, Cardano’s native token’s market value hovered mostly below $0.25 throughout September. Still, the vibrant developer activity signals the team’s commitment, undeterred by the token’s lukewarm market performance. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

Moreover, the more an influencer card is used by players, the more they receive from Fantasy.top. The power levels are based on the last seven days. Fantasy.top leverages the current narrative of social finance, or SocialFi, which is hot after Friend.tech launched its native token FRIEND. FRIEND launched at an initial price of $3.03 but fell sharply in just three hours to $0.89. However, the token made a significant recovery to $2.19 at the time of writing. A crypto researcher known as DeFi Edge explained in his newsletter that Fantasy.top is better than Friend.tech at aligning the interests of users, influencers, and the protocol itself. “Influencers will get a share of revenue from: users/card traders want to buy cards from their favorite influencers; influencers are intrinsically motivated to improve their X engagement; this boosts their points, so users and influencers are perfectly aligned; the platform is giving money to influencers whose cards are used in competitions, so influencers are happy; the protocol wants more traders and influencers on their platform, so they’ll keep shipping features to make Fantasy.top more attractive.” Influencers receive 1.5% of all the fees collected from the trading volume of their respective cards, and also a 10% cut on pack sales which is split between the cards discovered. Packs are like boosters found in traditional trading card games, where a user gets random cards by opening them. At the time of writing, the platform’s marketplace generated 285.5 ETH in fees, equivalent to $863,000. The Fantasy.top platform is only accessible with referral codes, and it doesn’t have a native token yet.

188::https://theconversation.com/crypto-crash-market-volatility-is-testing-investor-will-but-crypto-enthusiasts-still-see-a-future-for-the-asset-class-185339::The Conversation::article::Crypto crash: market volatility is testing investor will but crypto-enthusiasts still see a future for the asset class::Are we witnessing the beginning of the end for crypto or is this just another crash in a volatile market?::Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, remains a bellweather for the sector. It hit an all-time high of more than US$68,000 (£55,600) in November 2021, when the overall value of the cryptocurrency market was close to US$3 trillion. In the months since, however, most major cryptocurrencies have fallen by more 70% and bitcoin itself has dropped below US$18,000. Is this just another crash in the volatile cryptocurrency market, or is this the beginning of the end for this alternative asset class? When bitcoin was first introduced in early 2009, it was a new type of asset. While trading was thin initially, price appreciation drove its value to nearly US$20,000 in late 2017. This happened as more retail investors were drawn to cryptocurrencies as a supposed hedge or safe-haven versus other asset classes. And as the market grew, so too did the range of investment opportunities. Futures and options – financial contracts to buy or sell an asset or security at a specific price or date – are a common hedging tool used in other markets such as oil or the stock market. In December 2017, the first bitcoin futures on a regulated exchange were listed by the Chicago Board Options Exchange. Bitcoin options followed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in January 2020. This period of expansion was topped by the launch of the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in October 2021, providing investors with exposure to bitcoin without having to buy it on a crypto exchange. At the same time, the traditional financial sector was becoming increasingly accepting of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class. A 2021 study of institutional investors found seven in 10 expected to buy or invest in digital assets in the future. This combination of maturity and acceptance, however, also increased the correlation between the stock market and cryptocurrencies, leading to a decline in their safe-haven properties. Bitcoin was fairly disconnected from traditional financial markets in its early days. But as it became “just another asset”, the sector began to be affected by the same macroeconomic factors that influence traditional markets. The US Federal Reserve’s decision to raise interest rates by 0.75% in June to combat growing inflation, the ongoing war in Ukraine, and the subsequent rise in oil prices have all acted as a drag on cryptocurrencies in recent months. Moves to regulate the sector have also had an impact. But it isn’t only macroeconomic factors that have caused this crypto downturn. In May and June this year, stablecoin values plummetted, major cryptocurrency exchange Binance paused bitcoin withdrawals due to a “stuck transaction”, and lending platform Celsius Network froze withdrawals and transfers citing “extreme” market conditions. Amid this disruption, users of public blockchain platform Solana have reportedly voted to temporarily take control of a so-called “whale” account – the platform’s largest at around US$20 million – to stop the account owner liquidating its positions and driving prices down even further. Together, these factors have caused investor confidence to drain from the sector. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is almost at an all-time-low of 9/100, which indicates “extreme fear”. The index was at 75/100 when bitcoin reached its November 2021 high. So what does the future hold for this alternative asset class? As can only be expected in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, the range of views is extreme. Some see this market correction as a great time to “buy the dip”. Others believe this is the end of the party for cryptocurrencies. Resolute bitcoiners can always find positive signs in the market and many use on-chain metrics (trading signals based on data gleaned from public blockchain transactions) to determine good times to buy. Recently, popular metrics including market value to realised value (MVRV – a ratio showing current versus average coin prices) suggest bitcoin is about to start an accumulation period based on past history. On the other hand, this may be an indication of confirmation bias as investors search for signals that confirm their beliefs. Others argue this is just one more instance in a long line of bursting cryptocurrency bubbles – a typical crypto market cycle. Comparisons with the dotcom crash of 2000 have been rife in the market, but crypto enthusiasts argue the basic premise of dotcom stocks was correct – in that the internet was the future. They believe the same is true of bitcoin, predicting that the sector will recover. Economists have studied bubbles for centuries, however, and evidence shows many assets never recover nominal price highs after the market bubble bursts. Some of these economists, including former US secretary of labor Robert Reich, have equated cryptocurrencies to Ponzi schemes that, unless regulated, will go the way of all such schemes and eventually collapse. Certainly, the vision of cryptocurrencies as a decentralised asset available on a peer-to-peer network with no barriers to entry goes against recent actions such as the freezing of withdrawals by some platforms. These moves will not go down well with crypto-enthusiasts. Further, the increased correlation of cryptocurrencies to other asset classes is diminishing their value as a diversification tool, while growing interest in Central Bank Digital Currencies threatens to further erode crypto’s attractiveness to its core investors. Cryptocurrencies also face challenges around energy use, privacy and security. It is not clear if these issues can be solved without eroding the elements that made cryptocurrencies popular in the first place. The recent US launch of a short Bitcoin ETF, which enables investors to gain from declines in the bitcoin price, will allow investors to hedge their positions and trade against bitcoin. Investing in cryptocurrencies is like riding a rollercoaster with large appreciations followed by sudden dips. Volatility is endemic, bubbles and crashes are commonplace, and there are divisive opinions on environmental, ethical and social benefits. The major correction in this market has tested the will of even the most avid crypto-enthusiast. Buckle up because this story is not over yet.::2022-06-22T13:36:33Z::Binance, Bitcoin, Crypto, Cryptocurrency, Decentralised finance, Markets, Trading, dotcom bubble, market crash::Andrew Urquhart::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/470141/original/file-20220621-15-gj9nrl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=9%2C971%2C6221%2C3110&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
189::https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/05/15/what-the-dojs-first-mev-lawsuit-means-for-ethereum/::CoinDesk::article::What the DOJ’s First MEV Lawsuit Means for Ethereum::In a highly technical overview of an exploit that has since been patched, government prosecutors find that exploiting code is a crime. CoinDesk reached out to several experts in the Ethereum community to get their views on the case.::The U.S. Department of Justice charged two brothers with orchestrating an attack on Ethereum trading bots, charging them with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. In essence, the brothers found a way to target bots that were frontrunning transactions in a process called maximal extractable value, or MEV, which refers to the amount of money that can be bled out of the block production process by ordering transactions. Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates. This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here. MEV, which itself is controversial, can be a highly lucrative game dominated by automated bots that often comes at blockchain users’ expense, which is partially why so many in the crypto community have rushed to denounce the DOJ’s complaint. However, this is hardly a Robinhood situation, where two brothers, Anton and James Peraire-Bueno, of Bedford, Massachusetts, were stealing from the rich to give to the poor. As indicated by the DOJ’s filing, the brothers brought in approximately $25 million in at least eight separate transactions in what, according to the DOJ, was a highly orchestrated and premeditated plot. They set up shell companies and searched for ways to safely launder funds to avoid detection. The highly technical complaint spells out the process by which the exploit occurred, which the DOJ calls “the very first of its kind.” “They used a flaw in MEV boost to push invalid signatures to preview bundles. That gives an unfair advantage via an exploit,” former employee of the Ethereum Foundation and Flashbots Hudson Jameson told CoinDesk in an interview. Jameson added that the Peraire-Bueno brothers were also running their own validator while extracting MEV, which violates something of a gentleman’s agreement in MEV circles. “No one else in the MEV ecosystem was doing both of those things at once that we know of,” he added. “They did more than just play by both the codified and pinky promise rules of MEV extraction.” “It's not some kind of robin hood story as they didn't return the money to people MEVers extracted it from,” pseudonymous researcher Banteg said. At a more technical level, the brothers were able to exploit an open-source built by MEV firm Flashbots called mev-boost that gave them an unequal view into how MEV bots were ordering transactions. (Mev-boost is an open-source protocol that allows different actors to compete to “build” the most valuable blocks by ordering transactions.) “Having access to the block body allowed the malicious proposer to extract transactions from the stolen block and use them in their own block where it could exploit those transactions. In particular, the malicious proposer constructed their own block that broke the sandwich bots’ sandwiches up and effectively stole their money,” according to a Flashbots’ post-mortem in 2023. In particular, and central to the DOJ’s case, is that the brothers found a way to sign false transactions in order to run the scheme. “This False Signature was designed to, and did, trick the Relay to prematurely release the content of the proposed block to the defendants, including private transaction information,” the document reads. “The invalid header part is going to be the needle that this all balances on I think,” a crypto researcher, who asked to remain anonymous, said. “I feel the indictment indicates that and therefore it may actually be a good thing that SDNY is verryyyy tech savvy in this and clearly layed out where they fucked up and alluded to the inevitability of MEV in blockchains,” Jameson said. Others have also noted the technical sophistication of the DOJ’s argument, which seems to be less of an indictment of MEV or Ethereum itself than of an attempt to profit by unfairly gaining information. “If you hope Ethereum will always be a ‘dark forest’ where on-chain predators compete with each other for arbitrage opportunities, then you probably dislike this prosecution,” Consensys General Counsel Bill Hughes told CoinDesk in an interview. “Thankfully, I think there are only a few who are actually like that. If you prefer predatory behavior like this be curtailed, which is the vast majority, then you are likely to feel the opposite.” See also: Ethereum Has Gatekeepers (for Good Reason) | Opinion “All of the defendants' preparation for the attack and their completely ham-fisted attempts to cover their tracks afterwards, including extensive incriminating google searches, just helps the government prove they intended to steal. All that evidence will look very bad to a jury. I suspect they plead guilty at some point,” he added. Still, others remain convinced that exploiting MEV bots designed to reorder transactions is fair game. “It's a little hard to sympathize with MEV bots and block builders getting f*cked over by block proposers, in the exact same way they are f*cking over end users,” the anonymous researcher said. Jameson, for his part, said the MEV is something the Ethereum community should work to minimize on Ethereum, but that it’s a difficult problem to solve. For now, the process is “inevitable.” “Until it can be eliminated, let's study it. Let's illuminate it. Let's minimize it. And since it does exist, let's make it as open as possible for anyone to participate with the same rules,” he said. If there is any silver lining, the Flashbots team were able to patch the error that enabled the attack fairly quickly, Cornell Tech professor Ari Juels said. “There are no lasting implications,” he added. “There is of course an irony in what took place: A thief stealing money from sandwich bots, which themselves exploit users in the view of many in the community.” Edited by Benjamin Schiller.

190::https://beincrypto.com/saving-planet-profit-carbon-credits-bitcoin/::BeInCrypto::article::Saving the Planet And Making a Profit: Carbon Credits Are the New Bitcoin::Web3 us revolutionizing sustainable energy markets through blockchain-powered energy trading platforms and carbon-offsetting markets.::We use cookies to improve your experience. Web3’s underlying technologies are revolutionizing the future of sustainable energy markets through blockchain-powered peer-to-peer energy trading platforms and carbon-offsetting markets. In pursuing sustainability, web3 technologies have paved the way for inventive solutions to bolster climate-focused ventures, renewable energy programs, and initiatives to capture and store carbon. The recent decline of over 70% in the value of web3-related assets is indeed disconcerting. However, the focus should not be on their volatility. The fundamental technological advancements that have enabled web3 should be the highlight. These innovations are set to impact many sectors of the global economy and serve as a locomotive for reaching sustainability goals. BE[IN]CRYPTO Global Crypto and Web3 Sustainability Report Sustainable Growth & Reducing Climate Impact “Blockchain innovation and tokenized carbon credit have the potential to transform the way carbon is traded” The blockchain industry is taking urgent steps toward addressing climate change by promoting sustainability and reducing carbon emissions in multiple sectors. Blockchain can revolutionize the management of carbon credits, offsetting and measuring carbon footprints. Carbon trading is commonly used to meet international emissions reduction targets, including those outlined in the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement. Carbon credits also serve as certificates representing the right to emit one tonne of carbon dioxide or its equivalent. Under a carbon trading scheme, companies that emit less than their allocated carbon credits can sell their surplus credits to companies that exceed their emissions limit. This situation then creates a financial incentive for reducing emissions by putting a price on carbon. By offering a transparent, secure, and decentralized platform, blockchain facilitates the seamless integration and management of renewable energy sources. Allowing companies to account for carbon emissions precisely. As renewable energy sources become increasingly integrated into existing power grids, blockchain technology is critical in streamlining the process of bookkeeping emissions and green energy used by the single grid. A significant instance of this integration is the partnership between Energy Web Foundation (EWF) and Vodafone. In 2020, they launched a blockchain-focused energy management system to improve the integration of renewable and distributed energy assets within power grids. Utilizing secure IoT connectivity backed by blockchain technology, this system optimizes the energy market while fostering a more sustainable future. Blockchain-based decentralized carbon registries offer a transparent and impenetrable record of carbon credits, enhancing the efficiency and openness of the carbon market. For example, Powerledger has created the world’s first blockchain-based renewable energy trading platform. Allowing consumers and producers to monitor, trace, and trade every kilowatt generated off-grid. Simultaneously, it provides a trustworthy and secure platform for conducting carbon trading transactions. As we move into the next decade, web3 will play a crucial part in establishing trust in the carbon market and crafting a more dependable system for monitoring the ownership and exchange of carbon credits. Blockchain technology sets the stage for a more transparent, trustworthy, and eco-friendly carbon market. Blockchain technology is taking peer-to-peer energy trading to the next level. It’s changing how solar energy is traded among neighbors, businesses, and entities. By allowing direct energy trading, these platforms enable individuals and organizations to monetize excess solar power. They can also foster a more sustainable and decentralized energy market. Despite the existence of environmental credits, the current market structure creates friction. Veridium, an ecological tech startup, offers a solution to the issue through tokenization and smart contracts. The startup recently joined forces with IBM to use its technology to issue and manage carbon credit-backed blockchain tokens. Blockchain technology also allows households to combine solar energy production and battery storage. They then effectively operate as a cohesive virtual power plant. This approach empowers consumers to participate more actively in the energy market and promotes a greener and decentralized energy landscape. BE[IN]CRYPTO Global Crypto and Web3 Sustainability Report Sustainable Growth & Reducing Climate Impact The potential of web3 tools and blockchain technologies extends well beyond the realm of cryptocurrency’s volatile and often speculative market. To successfully navigate this shifting tide, it is essential to develop a comprehensive understanding of the transformative potential of the technology and its implications for the broader business landscape. Advocates of the carbon market will likely push for uniform global standards that provide increased assurance to market participants, fostering expansion in the process. The web3 industry has developed innovative methods for supporting climate-related initiatives, renewable energy projects, and carbon sequestration efforts. One potential solution to address the uncertainty created by changing policies and questions about the validity of certain credits is to digitalize the carbon credit market and remove intermediaries. Improving market transparency can also ensure investments are directed towards genuine sustainability initiatives. This could help boost the slowing growth of voluntary carbon markets.

191::https://blockworks.co/news/biggest-blockchain-developments-2023::Blockworks::article::3 of the biggest blockchain tech developments in 2023::Protocols continued to build in the blockchain space this past year despite a tumultuous 2022.::Protocols continued to build in the blockchain space this past year despite a tumultuous 2022 Google’s head of strategy and Web3 Rich Widmann | Permissionless II by Blockworks The crypto ecosystem has achieved an array of major technology milestones over the past year. Despite a series of unfortunate events in 2022 — with the collapse of the Terra ecosystem, and then later the bankruptcy of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX — the blockchain tech space proved resilient in 2023. In particular, we’ve seen developments in the infrastructure and technology sectors with new innovations designed to make blockchains faster, more secure and private. This year marked the launch of a series of zero-knowledge (zk) rollups. First, we saw the launch of zkSync Era, followed closely by Polygon’s zkEVM, later Linea, and more recently, the =nil; Foundation — just to name a few. Rollups share the same goal: make blockchains operate more efficiently by reducing the amount of block space needed to make a transaction by executing more transactions off-chain. This will, as a consequence, also reduce gas fees and fixed costs. Zero-knowledge rollups, in this particular case, are not only able to perform off-chain executions, but they are also able to determine if the information is accurately executed without disclosing the information on the mainnet. This differs from optimistic rollups, which automatically presume that information is accurate and rely on fraud proofs to challenge suspicious transactions. It is important to note that more work still needs to be done to ensure zkRollups are completely decentralized and permissionless. Existing zero-knowledge technology is subject to upgradability risks. These risks refer to whether or not a blockchain can be upgraded or subject to changes — with blockchains being more secure if they can not be upgraded. Blockchain interoperability also made some impressive improvements this year. From the introduction of Chainlink’s CCIP to LayerZero’s recent partnership with Google Cloud and JPMorgan, cross-chain interoperability protocol teams are actively working on connecting various private and public blockchains. Blockchain interoperability protocols enable smart contracts across different blockchain networks to communicate with each other and facilitate the transfer of liquidity. This is typically achieved through burning tokens in the smart contract of a source chain and then minting new, corresponding tokens on a destination chain. Another way to transfer tokens is through bridging, where tokens are locked on a source chain and then minted natively on the destination chain. Such tools can enable users of various blockchains to seamlessly swap, lend and stake their tokens across various ecosystems for a small gas fee. To bring more liquidity on-chain, developers real-world asset (RWA) protocols are also looking at ways these assets could serve as collateral through tokenization. RWAs in the space could include assets such as cash, gold, real estate and US treasury bonds, for example. One of the most well-known RWAs today would be stablecoins — like Circle’s USDC and Tether’s USDT, which are widely used across DeFi protocols. Some of the protocols behind on-chain financing include Centrifuge, Maple Finance and Goldfinch. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

This transition could potentially impact the value of Dogecoin as there has been a connection between GameStops stock and the price of Dogecoin. Prior to becoming CEO Cohen served as GameStops Executive Chairman since January 2022. Held the title of its shareholder. This move is considered by experts as an initiative by the companys board to revitalize their brand. In his role Cohen will take on responsibilities as President, CEO and Chairman at GameStop indicating a significant restructuring within the companys leadership. Enough sources indicate that Cohen will not be accepting any salary for these positions. Following the announcement about Cohens appointment GameStops stock experienced a 10% increase. Market analysts interpret this rise as a vote of confidence in Cohens expertise and his genuine commitment to steer the company through its challenges. The decline in physical store sales adds a hurdle to overcome. Cohens involvement with GameStop is seen as a development due to his ownership stake in the company. He began making investments, in GameStop between September and December 2020. He was an advocate, for a stock that numerous hedge funds had disregarded anticipating the failure of the video game retailer. However defying all expectations in January 2021 there was a squeeze” that skyrocketed GameStops stock prices by an astounding 1,500% reaching approximately $81 as individual investors showed their support. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

Salvor Lending’s strategies are tailored to boost capital efficiency across Avalanche’s NFT and DeFi ecosystems. The platform encourages borrowing against NFT and meme coin holdings, providing an alternative to selling valuable assets. Lenders benefit from earning interest on short-term loans, while borrowers gain immediate liquidity to fund new investments. “Salvor’s participation in the Avalanche Rush Program marks a significant milestone for bridging DeFi and NFTs on Avalanche,” said Aytunc Yildizli, CEO of the Avalanche Foundation. “By facilitating secured loans against NFTs, Salvor not only potentially enhances liquidity but also widens the scope for NFT owners to engage in the financial ecosystem without selling their assets.” Salvor has evolved from an art-centric marketplace since its launch, in November 2022, to a comprehensive trading and lending platform. They introduced unique features like NFT liquidity pools, a launchpad, and the P2P NFT lending protocol. The addition of a peer-to-peer token lending protocol for meme coins on Avalanche aims to further improve their liquidity.

194::https://theconversation.com/stablecoin-volatility-shows-an-urgent-need-for-regulation-to-protect-consumers-182886::The Conversation::article::Stablecoin volatility shows an urgent need for regulation to protect consumers::Uncertainty is affecting what used to be the safer end of the market.::Some cryptocurrencies have always been fairly volatile, with values soaring or plunging within a short space of time. So for the more cautious investor, “stablecoins” were considered the sensible place to go. As the name implies, they are designed to be a steadier and safer bet. At the moment though, that stability is proving hard to find. The value of one of the most popular stablecoins, Terra (also known as UST), has fluctuated wildly in the last few days, before dropping dramatically – and is yet to recover. Before the crash, Terra was in the top 10 cryptoassets, with a value of over US$18.7 billion. At the time of writing, this had collapsed to less than US$7 billion. Investors have taken to social media to lament this development. Some spoke of lost life savings and the devastating impact of the currency’s collapse. And they are right to be worried. The impact of volatility in the stablecoin arena should not be underestimated and could destabilise the entire sector. For in theory, stablecoins are supposed to offer the transactional benefits of more traditional cryptoassets (such as Bitcoin) but with a predictably stable worth. Many stablecoins are backed by other assets (typically the US dollar) or commodities (often gold) and involve the stablecoin provider buying – and then holding – the equivalent amount of their chosen asset to ensure the coin remains stable. So while the value of the underlying asset might increase or decrease, the value of the stablecoin should at least remain at a consistent ratio with whatever underpins it. But “algorithmic stablecoins” like Terra work differently. Terra holds no reserve asset or commodity, and instead is meant to hold its value using an algorithm, which is designed to maintain a balance between the stablecoin and a partner coin (a more traditional cryptocurrency). In this case Terra is tied to a partner coin called Luna – and the value of Luna has crashed. Its value is now less than US$0.06 having been trading at around US$82.00 just seven days earlier. In a climate where the value of Terra and Luna are both drastically declining, the algorithm cannot solve the issue of decreasing faith in the paired currencies – and the stabilisation feature simply does not work. As a result, fear kicks in and more people sell, just like a traditional bank run, where there is mass withdrawal of funds and sudden drastic loss in value. Stablecoins backed by assets tend to avoid this, due to the long term steady value of their peg which builds consumer confidence. But they have issues too. Tether, a coin pegged to the US dollar, has had bumps in the road amid questions over whether the company which issues the coins hold the reserves it claims to have. And in recent days Tether too has seen its value fall. All of this undermines the basic premise of these coins – that they will remain stable. Customers choose to buy them to either shield against volatility in traditional crypto markets until they rise again, or to use them as a more traditional account (like a regular bank account) and take advantage of the benefits they offer with regard to speed, cost, and ease of international transactions. But investors with their funds in Terra have seen their savings drop by around half. The fact it has still not stabilised does little to alleviate worries. In simple terms, the potential for a cryptocurrency crisis is very real. This is why the approach of governments worldwide needs to change. While plenty has been said about regulation in the UK and the US, there has been little meaningful action. If they fail to act, it will be difficult to advocate the use of stablecoins if they continue to expose consumers to the very volatility and risk they are supposed to avoid. The time for allowing the sector freedom to innovate seems to have passed. Regulation is essential – to offer consumer protection, and ban excessively risky practices – if the potential of stablecoins is to be realised. That potential is something that many feel could revolutionise the global economy, speeding up transactions, reducing costs and increasing transparency. But allowing the sector the opportunity to innovate should not come at the expense of people’s savings. If withdrawals persist, it will test both the stability of a particular stablecoin, and more broadly, whether the entire sector has a future. One stablecoin struggling is bad news. But two or more could be catastrophic for customer confidence.::2022-05-12T14:16:25Z::Crypto regulation, Cryptocurrency, Cryptomarkets, Stablecoins, Terra::Matthew Shillito::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/462772/original/file-20220512-19-r6yph2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=146%2C625%2C8728%2C4364&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
195::https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/05/15/depins-solution-to-ais-biggest-blind-spot/::CoinDesk::article::DePIN’s Solution to AI’s Biggest Blind Spot::Decentralized machine perception, managed by tokens and cryptographically secure, offers a privacy and effectiveness upgrade over centralized systems, says Nils Pihl, CEO and Founder of Auki Labs. Spatial computing and privacy. Corporations need privacy, too Decentralized machine perception networks::It’s the year 2030 and you’ve sent your humanoid robot to go buy ketchup at the grocery store. It’s a capable walker, it has dexterous hands, and it can carry more groceries than any parent. High-resolution cameras, gyroscopes and pressure sensors help the robot move quietly through the aisles with such grace that you almost forget that it is hopelessly lost. Like its human counterparts, it is doomed to wander aimlessly around the store taking bets on if this is the kind of store that keeps the ketchup in the condiments or sauces aisle. Nils Pihl, CEO and Founder of Auki Labs, is an entrepreneur, behavioral engineer and social transhumanist specializing in the intersection of modern technology and human behavior. Fully 65% of American grocery shoppers spend over half an hour in the store per shopping trip, and the average shopper also leaves without an item they couldn’t find every third visit. Without some pretty significant overhauls to how robots and computers understand and navigate the physical world, there’s not much reason to believe that your humanoid robot would fare any better — not without a decentralized machine perception network, perhaps the most vital DePIN for a future with independent robotic agents. Like humans, machines either navigate by memory or guidance. For decades, the most common way for machines and humans to get guidance has been through geopositioning satellites like the GPS. As our cities have grown, however, the GPS is starting to show its age. Although you rarely think about it, the GPS is a line-of-sight based technology that requires an uninterrupted path between you and several satellites. That’s why it works so poorly in big cities and indoor environments. Several advancements have been made to try to fill in the gaps. One of the first, from the early days of mobile computing, was to quietly have cellphones measure the signal strength to every WiFi router they passed. Over time, thanks to complex triangulation, companies like Skyhook and Google have managed to create low-resolution maps showing the locations of many of the world's WiFi routers. This is why navigation applications like Google Maps will ask you to turn on your WiFi to get better results. In the last decade, critics raised many privacy concerns and lawsuits related to WiFi triangulation And it is fair to say that, unfortunately, privacy lost that battle. It is of some consolation, perhaps, that WiFi triangulation still only helps the average user position themselves to within a few meters — not enough for our ketchup-fetching robot to even correctly understand what aisle it’s in. And so, big tech has turned to the next promising advance in geolocation: visual positioning systems. Spearheaded by companies like Niantic and Snap, visual positioning systems (VPS) compare the world as seen by an onboard camera to an external memory of what the world looks like, stored on their centrally controlled cloud. In a nutshell, a VPS is a trade where you tell big tech what you are looking at so that they can tell where you are. Visual positioning systems are accurate down to the centimeter in ideal circumstances, and accurate to under a meter in many public urban spaces. It’s because of this unparalleled precision that big tech companies are betting on the VPS for the future of robotics and AR glasses. But that should make us pause. Remembering the many privacy violations of the simpler bygone days of mobile social media — how will we fare when big tech companies can see the world through our very eyes, and our homes and private spaces through our machine companions? If you walk into a grocery store and start filming the shelves you’ll quickly find yourself escorted out of the store. Products placed at eye level are more likely to be picked up and bought, and retailers put careful thought into how they place their products to maximize sales. As such, the visual merchandising layout of stores are carefully guarded competitive secrets. Simply put, the stores are not interested in sharing the product layout of their stores with a central service. It would be unreasonable to expect that our robot could simply show up at the store and instantly know where every single product is, because it would undermine the intellectual property of the store. Instead, the best we can hope for is that the store has its own self-hosted and secure system that can answer robot questions about individual products, and guide AI and AR glasses to where they need to go without compromising corporate security. The attentive reader will already spot where DePIN is promising to outperform the giants of the Web2 era, and bring us our ketchup in a privacy-preserving way. Unlike humans, robots and computers could exchange spatial data with each other, collaboratively perceiving the world together. Collaborative spatial computing would allow machines to navigate the world better by connecting to other external sources of information. In a Web3 DePIN paradigm, this exchange can both be financially incentivized and cryptographically secure. Imagining that our grocery shopping robot could find the ketchup faster without compromising corporate security is a cute example. But the implications of decentralized machine perception are staggering. Once self-driving cars can coordinate with each other, and exchange live traffic information, traffic will be radically transformed. In Beijing, where there are more cars on the road than there are people in Los Angeles, over 1,000 years of human productivity are lost in transit every single day. Decentralized machine perception would allow these cars to move faster in coordination with each other, unlocking hundreds of years of productivity daily. Decentralized machine perception will one day allow for privacy-preserving AR glasses with a smaller form factor, as the glasses can offload some of the heavy spatial computing to local positioning servers, and change human communication in ways as profound as the invention of writing or the telephone. As our civilization grows to over 100 billion intelligent decision makers over the next twenty years, decentralized machine perception networks will help each and every one of them find their place in the world, both on Earth and beyond.

196::https://beincrypto.com/us-debt-default-spike-bitcoin-experts/::BeInCrypto::article::Experts Predict What Will Happen to Bitcoin and Stablecoins if US Defaults::BeInCrypto asked experts how a U.S. debt default increase after the country hit the debt ceiling could influence Bitcoin and crypto markets.::We use cookies to improve your experience.  Satoshi Nakamoto conceived Bitcoin (BTC) to be an independent payment instrument. Financial markets, however, still influence the crypto industry, and economic problems affect crypto. The digital asset market risks the consequences of a U.S. debt ceiling default. BeInCrypto asked experts to weigh in on the effects of a default on Bitcoin and stablecoins. The United States reached its debt ceiling in January 2023. The ceiling is a limit Congress places on loans the government can take. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen predicted in May that the U.S. could default by June 1 if Congress didn’t raise the debt ceiling. The consequences of this scenario are unpredictable. Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s rating agency, says a U.S. default could destroy the existing financial system. His opinion is not universally shared. For example, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon argues that the U.S. authorities will not risk a default. President Joe Biden backs the optimists. On May 17, the head of the country announced that there would be no default. However, online polls reveal that many expect the worst. Now let’s investigate how the U.S. ended up in this unpleasant situation. U.S. spending since 2022 exceeded the income that the U.S. Treasury received from taxes and fees. The country’s debt grew significantly against the backdrop of the 2008 financial crisis and the height of the coronavirus pandemic. During these periods, the U.S. authorities spent large sums on stimulus payments. The growing tension in the geopolitical arena in 2022 dealt another blow to the American economy. Bloomberg analysts write that a U.S. default will provoke a flow of assets into gold, U.S. Treasury bonds, and Bitcoin. As polls have shown, professional investors prefer precious metals. The editors of BeInCrypto decided to conduct their own survey to understand the effects a U.S. default could have on BTC and the general crypto market. Experts envisage two potential outcomes: Dmitry Noskov of the StormGain crypto exchange says that the U.S. default will promote gold and Bitcoin’s growth since Bitcoin is a digital asset analog of the precious metal. Noskov says the default could quicken BTC’s rise to the $30,000 level and beyond. Nikolai Zhuravlev, General Director of TsFA.RF agreed. “A U.S. default will definitely support the growth of Bitcoin, since many investors consider it a kind of ‘safe haven’ not only in comparison with the dollar, but even with traditional ‘safe haven currencies’ – the yen and the Swiss franc. Bitcoin is called “digital gold,” which has become more popular than any fiat currency.” Dean of the Faculty of Digital Economy and Mass Communications of MTUCI Sergey Gataullin agreed with the forecast, saying the gold, Bitcoin, and U.S. Treasury Bonds could be in the spotlight. Blockchain developer Evgeny Grechenok chipped in, noting that BTC attracts investors with its decentralized nature and limited issuance. At the same time, he drew attention to Bitcoin’s high volatility. “During the default period, a sharp demand for Bitcoin will create the prerequisites for the growth of the asset, but then there will be a period of correction, due to which its value can drop significantly. It will be very important to find the right entry and exit points for the asset.” Arthur Meinhard, Head of the Analytical Department for Global Markets at IC Fontvielle, reflected on a default’s effect on the stablecoin market. He said stablecoins could lose their investment appeal since most are in short-term U.S. government bonds and cash. “Stablecoins, being a derivative of the U.S. dollar, will experience significant selling pressure: crypto-investors will begin to massively get rid of them, preferring to shift to Bitcoin and other crypto-assets. “Against this background, increased volatility of the entire cryptocurrency market is expected, firstly, due to massive purchases of crypto-assets, and, secondly, downward decoupling of stablecoins from parity to the US dollar one to one.” A U.S. default could trigger a flow of assets into the crypto industry. There were many historical examples when the problems of the traditional finance market caused an increase in investor interest in cryptocurrency. For example, Bitcoin experienced its best week against the backdrop of the U.S. banking crisis in the spring of 2023. At the same time, experts recalled the high volatility of BTC. A significant correction is possible in the event of a rapid increase in the Bitcoin price. Do not forget the connection between the crypto industry and the traditional financial market. The latter’s problems can prove bearish for crypto long-term. Also, experts suggest a crisis in the stablecoin market should the U.S. government default on its debt. This crisis could worsen the overall health of the crypto industry. For BeInCrypto’s latest Bitcoin (BTC) analysis, click here.

The Series E round was led by Kingsway, which led a funding round for the company in October 2022, according to Bloomberg. The outlet characterized the funding round as “strategic financing.” Blockchain.com scored a $14 billion valuation in an early 2022 funding round, as Bloomberg reported at the time. According to the outlet, the new Kingsway-led round was raised at “less than half” of that amount. The potential for a down round — wherein a company raises at a valuation lower than a previous fundraise — was previously reported by Bloomberg. With the fresh capital in hand, Blockchain.com has raised as much as $600 million since its founding in 2011, according to Crunchbase data. Lightspeed Venture Partners, Coinbase Ventures, Lakestar and Baillie Gifford also took part in the round. Lightspeed Venture Partners led the early 2022 deal.

Since many people just pay whatever fee their wallet suggests by default, this could’ve led to users paying more than needed. For some context, opBNB is a second-layer solution built on Ethereum and was rolled out on September 13 by the same folks behind BNB Chain. They found out that MetaMask had been using an average from all networks to suggest gas fees, which might work well for other networks but wasn’t a good fit for opBNB. That’s because opBNB’s fees can actually be a lot cheaper compared to many other networks. To address this, the BNB Chain team reached out to MetaMask, and the latter was cooperative and updated their fee recommendation algorithm. Now, users can see the actual costs by trying a transaction on opBNB within MetaMask, which, according to BNB Chain, often shows that their fees are more competitive. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

As founding members, they will hold two-year seats on the Technical Oversight Committee, contributing to governance and policy development, said DeRec in today’s blog announcement. We are excited to announce that @Ripple and @XRPLLabs have joined @swirldslabs and @AlgoFoundation as Founding Members of the Decentralized Recovery Alliance, with two-year seats on the Technical Oversight Committee providing input on governance and core Alliance policies. #DeRec… pic.twitter.com/APP4Z70jIC — Decentralized Recovery Alliance (@DeRecAlliance) May 9, 2024 The HBAR Foundation, the Hashgraph Association, Acoer, BankSocial, Blade Labs, The Building Blocks, Casper Association, Constellation Network, and Revive Labs, have become DeRec’s Alliance Members. They will help create a new interoperability recovery standard to facilitate the recovery and adoption of digital assets, DeRec stated. Initially launched by Hedera and Algorand members, the DeRec Alliance’s mission is to simplify digital asset recovery, making it as user-friendly as Web2 experiences. Currently recovering crypto can be complicated. The Alliance wants to make it as simple as recovering an online account. This will be especially helpful for new users who might be discouraged by the complexity of Web3. The DeRec Alliance is developing an open-source protocol designed to help users recover lost digital assets such as secret keys, passwords, and seed phrases. By facilitating the recovery of secret keys, passwords, and seed phrases in a completely decentralized manner, the protocol ensures that personal data remains confidential and secure. The Alliance hopes that all blockchain companies will adopt this standard, making recovery easier across the entire crypto ecosystem. “The DeRec Alliance is a group of individuals and organizations committed to making the process of securing and recovering digital assets, accounts, passwords, and other secrets as simple as existing Web2 experiences,” said Dr. Leemon Baird, Hedera co-founder. Markus Infanger of RippleX expressed Ripple’s commitment to the Alliance’s goals. He also emphasized the importance of user-friendly private key management. “The DeRec Alliance addresses one of the biggest challenges facing mainstream crypto adoption—secure and user-friendly management of private keys,” Infanger stated. “Together, we can revolutionize how users manage their private keys, representing a major step forward for user security and adoption – not just for XRP Ledger users, but for everyone in crypto.” As noted, Alliance Members, including Acoer and BankSocial, are adopting DeRec standards and practices to make decentralized recovery accessible. They contribute to policy and oversee the development of DeRec-based solutions, with some already integrating the protocol into their systems. The DeRec Alliance represents a collective effort to overcome the challenges of digital asset self-custody and recovery, aiming to bring peace of mind to users and promote mainstream adoption of digital assets. “Improving the user experience and interoperability is required for mass adoption of digital assets and Web3 technologies more broadly. The innovative and democratized approach of DeRec is a huge step forward and we are excited to be a part of this evolution,” said Shayne Higdon, Co-Founder and CEO, The HBAR Foundation. “We are excited to join this alliance, recognizing the opportunity for greater levels of interoperability across chains and significantly improved user experience that will enable mainstream adoption of token holding,” said Ralf Kubli, Senior Director, Casper Association.

However, the social funding platform seized the approximately $10 million in donations that were raised, alleging that the movement failed to both prohibit the promotion of violence and harassment and adhere to sanctions Canadian authorities had imposed. Organizers responded quickly by turning to the world of cryptocurrency to evade seizures and continue funding their movement. They raised nearly $1 million in a matter of days. This Canadian story is a perfect example of how cryptocurrency can play a dual role of social support, but can also be used to evade sanctions. At the same time, in Ukraine the Kyiv government has shown enthusiasm about using cryptocurrency, which has enabled the country to get significant financial support for its defence extremely quickly. Our work examining the digital transformation of the accounting profession has led us to delve into the world of cryptocurrency to explore how it operates and how it is regulated. As the armed conflict between Ukraine and Russia rages on, countries’ interest in regulating cryptocurrency has never been so urgent. The conflict between Ukraine and Russia is not just a war of bombs and bullets. It is also a digital war of which cryptocurrency is just one of many components. Ukraine’s Ministry of Digital Transformation is getting lots of press for the ingenious way it is supporting the country’s resistance to the Russian invasion. This is being done through a sophisticated use of social media to promote Ukrainian interests around the world at hackathons, where hackers are rewarded with US$100,000 for successfully attacking Russian systems. After a Ukrainian government official tweeted that the country would now accept international aid via cryptocurrency, more than US$100 million was reportedly raised this way. Two funds were initially set up: one for humanitarian and the other for military purposes. However, as the violence escalated the funds were merged and directed entirely toward supporting the Ukrainian military, where there were used to purchase body armour, night vision goggles, helmets, medicine and food for frontline fighters. The government has stated that although the amount received in cryptocurrency is modest with respect to the total funds granted from international agencies, it was able to receive these funds much more quickly because of the absence of intermediaries. Bank transfers can, indeed, take several days to arrive in the Ukrainian government’s accounts. The cryptocurrency was deposited within a few minutes. This demonstrates the undeniable usefulness of cryptocurrency — the way it presently operates and is regulated — in supporting, in particular, the financial and economic systems of countries in distress. However, while digital warfare can benefit some people in human and military terms, particularly by overcoming the slowness of conventional financial systems, it can make it possible for others to circumvent the international sanctions that have been imposed on them. In this regard, it should be noted that according to some sources, cryptocurrency is also serving as a safe haven for many ordinary Russian citizens who are trying to hang on to their savings inside a banking system that has numerous restrictions and vulnerabilities, as the value of the ruble collapses. Economic sanctions against Russia are not new. A number have been put in place since the country annexed Crimea in 2014. The current Russian invasion of Ukraine has resulted in new financial and economic sanctions that penalize Russian organizations and individuals, including oligarchs. As a result, the value of the Russian ruble is falling to the point where several Russian subsidiaries of European banks are reportedly on the verge of bankruptcy. However, here again, proceeding through the lightly regulated cryptocurrency world could help Russian organizations, governments and oligarchs evade sanctions and carry on their financial activities. Since the start of the war, the conversion of Russian rubles into cryptocurrency has literally exploded. But is it really an effective and definitive way to dodge sanctions? Probably not, especially when it comes to the very large sums held by Russian oligarchs and large organizations. It is very unlikely that these sums could be entirely absorbed by the different types of cryptocurrency in circulation at the moment. Moreover, the usefulness of cryptocurrency for these types of transactions is temporary. The sums used to obtain cryptocurrency actually become traceable — and thus, subject to sanctions — as soon as they land in traditional bank accounts. Cyrptocurrency is also becoming less and less untraceable thanks to the increasing expertise of law enforcement. Read more: Are Russia's elite really using cryptocurrency to evade sanctions? From this perspective, the current digital war between Ukraine and Russia will likely serve as a catalyst to accelerate the regulatory takeover of the anarchic cryptocurrency world. It will then be up to each country to find mechanisms that will allow them to regulate virtual currencies — in hopes that the whole process will acquire a certain cohesion, internationally. In this sense, it appears to be essential for legislators in different countries to consider creating a balanced framework. The goal must be minimizing the possibilities of using the cryptocurrency universe as an illegal means of evasion without removing the efficiency that cryptocurrency offers — particularly the speed it provides for processing transactions. Striking this balance will not be easy.::2022-04-06T13:31:04Z::Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, Hacking, International aid, International sanctions, Russia, Russia sanctions, Ukraine, Ukraine invasion 2022, War, cyberwarfare::Mouna Hazgui::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/456140/original/file-20220404-12-54otej.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C571%2C5954%2C2972&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
201::https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/05/15/halving-impact-and-macro-shifts-create-tailwinds-for-bitcoin/::CoinDesk::article::Halving Impact and Macro Shifts Create Tailwinds for Bitcoin::Despite the drop in bitcoin’s price since April’s halving, there are still plenty of reasons to be bullish about BTC and crypto, says Paul Marino, Chief Revenue Officer at GraniteShares.::The fourth Bitcoin halving in April reduced the new bitcoin issuance rate to 3.125 BTC every ten minutes, sparking significant interest and speculation. Since then, Bitcoin has been down from its highs, with some investors concerned that the days of higher BTC prices are in the distant future. We believe March’s new high (above $70,000) was a "head fake" driven by new spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, considering the halving event and ongoing supply/demand issues, we expect a brighter future for BTC and crypto as the year progresses. You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Why do some pundits think Bitcoin has topped? And why did the selloff occur? Unlike past halvings, Bitcoin's price soared to a new high of $73,750 with a market cap of $1.44 trillion on March 14, a month before the halving. The rapid increase from the start of the year, when it was as low as $39,000, scared speculative investors and those in it for the "halving trade," prompting them to cash out. However, the retreat likely stemmed from macro factors, specifically hawkish comments by the Federal Reserve. These ignited a "risk-off" mentality as an interest rate cut became more unlikely in 2024, with a hike becoming possible. Since then, economic data has been weaker than expected, making a hike very unlikely for now. This shift has put the risk trade back on, setting an immediate floor in BTC prices, which have since recovered above $60,000. It also suggests a shift back to supply and demand factors for bitcoin, which appear favorable for higher prices. There are several reasons to be bullish on Bitcoin and crypto. First, the past three halvings have consistently led to new all-time highs in Bitcoin price in the months following the event. We believe this trend will accelerate as more institutional investors include BTC in their portfolios, further tightening the supply. This “rising tide" in BTC should lift all crypto boats. Second, the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 is a pivotal development. These ETFs, allowing investors to trade shares through existing retail brokerage accounts, promise wider availability through financial advisors. Firms such as Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, and LPL are conducting due diligence on their platforms for availability. Approval on these platforms seems inevitable, enhancing accessibility and simplifying the investment process in Bitcoin, which will likely lead to much higher demand. Third, regulatory developments in the global crypto markets will significantly influence Bitcoin's price dynamics. The potential passage of a U.S. bill establishing a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and Europe's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation is crucial. They will help dispel the notion that BTC and crypto are mere "pet rocks," acknowledging them as stores of value with technological utility. This shift in perception can transform Bitcoin and crypto from speculative instruments to strategic investments and, potentially, a flight-to-quality investment. Remember that a complex interplay of market dynamics, investor sentiment, technological advancements and macroeconomic events influences Bitcoin's price. I am bullish on BTC and crypto and will watch closely as the post-halving market continues.

202::https://beincrypto.com/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-k5-prosecutors/::BeInCrypto::article::Is Sam Bankman-Fried the Victim of a Double Standard?::As SBF's trial looms, prosecutors want him detained, though he has committed less witness intimidation than other high-profile defendants.::We use cookies to improve your experience.  Sam Bankman-Fried is too dangerous to be a free man in even the brief time left before the trial of the disgraced FTX founder begins in October, prosecutors assert. Multiple sources have quoted prosecutor Danielle Sassoon telling a judge in a Manhattan court on Wednesday that, in the case of SBF, “no set of release conditions can assure the safety of the community.” This brought objections from SBF’s attorney Mark Cohen, who reportedly learned of the request just before court proceedings began. Moreover, the request contrasts jarringly with the lenient treatment of Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, whose vicious witness intimidation was an open secret. The FTX founder has been living in California amid the flurry of litigation following the exchange’s collapse in November 2022. But his life is no picnic. His legal team is constantly on the defensive. Accusations have flown back and forth in recent days. Besides the charges related to the implosion of FTX, Alameda Research has sued asset manager K5 Global to reclaim $700 million that SBF had donated. K5 Global claims their dealings were a totally legitimate business relationship. Meanwhile, SBF’s lawyers have protested the actions of his replacement as CEO of FTX, John Ray III. In a recent court filing, they accused Ray of having made “repeated ad hominem attacks on Mr. Bankman-Fried—which have very little to do with his role recovering assets for FTX creditors.” SBF has come under fire for leaking private Google Docs entries of his former girlfriend, Caroline Ellison, to the New York Times. He now faces charges of intimidation and evidence tampering, on top of everything else. Ellison, who was head of Alameda Research, is widely expected to testify during the October trial. But for all the unpleasantness, it is far from clear that SBF poses a danger to the community. SBF’s lawyers argue that, in providing a reporter with the diary entries, he was merely granting the latter’s request for his side of the story. His actions were legal under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. They did not violate the protective order and bail conditions to which SBF is subject, they maintain. The lawyers made this point explicitly in their July 22 letter to Judge Lewis Kaplan of the Southern District of New York. They rebut charges of witness intimidation and evidence tampering. They maintain that SBF was well within his rights to speak to the media and grant a routine request for comment. The letter states: “Defense counsel independently verified that the documents were not part of the discovery and therefore did not implicate the protective order. Defense counsel contacted the prosecutors the following day and reported these findings and offered to provide copies of the documents to the Government’s filter team so that it could verify that the documents were not part of the discovery.” Observers are bound to ask whether the government, and some in the media, are treating a crypto entrepreneur unfairly. Holding him to a different standard than in another high-profile insolvency: the case of Theranos and its founder Elizabeth Holmes. Many former employees of Theranos said they lived in fear of retaliation from the company’s founder and CEO. They dared not share what they knew about the firm’s deceptive marketing practices. To do so could be fatal for their careers and possibly their lives. It’s not just that Holmes tampered with the intellectual property of scientists in her employ in order to take credit for their work, as John Carreyrou descibes in his book Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup. The climate at Theranos was toxic. Holmes did not tolerate disloyalty, real or imagined. It was so bad that one scientist made a point of copying internal communications and documents before resigning. None of this was a secret. The intimidation and abuse were the subject of articles by John Carreyrou in the Wall Street Journal as far back as 2015. Long before the case went to trial in September 2021. That’s not even the worst of it. Ian Gibbons, a scientist who raised concerns about Theranos testing devices, lost his job for not keeping silent. He later committed suicide. Gibbons’s widow blames the climate at the firm for his death. She says that Holmes never offered condolences or voiced remorse of any kind. Yet, for all her well-known witness intimidation, Holmes was able to live comfortably and in total freedom. She did not see the inside of a cell until May 2023, nearly two years after her trial began. A stark contrast with the measures that prosecutors in the FTX case now publicly advocate. Even without credible evidence that SBF’s dealings with reporters violate any law or term of his release. A crypto entrepreneur, it seems, is far more dangerous than an ex-CEO whose ruthlessness drove a potential whistleblower to suicide.

The tests were carried out under the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s Project Guardian and was designed specifically to enable fund managers to tokenize their portfolios on chosen blockchains. Wealth managers could also purchase and rebalance their positions across these different interoperable blockchain networks. The blockchain stacks chosen for this proof of concept include Provenance Blockchain, JPMorgan’s own Onyx Digital Assets and Avalanche. Cross-chain communication protocol Axelar and issuance-slash-trading platform Oasis Pro also contributed to the initiative. It is important to note that these transactions were done in a permissioned manner, meaning access was limited to a select few participants on private blockchain networks. So, the transactions won’t show up on public chain explorers such as Axelarscan, Mintscan or Snowscan, though example transactions are detailed in a recent JPMorgan and Apollo report. Galen Moore, global communications lead at Axelar, told Blockworks that Axelar created a permissioned instance for connecting different chains by modifying its existing cross-chain configuration so that it was in alignment with the privacy and access management requirements set by the proof of concept. “The purpose of this Project Guardian was to demonstrate a system that would allow a portfolio manager to manage a large number of discretionary portfolios comprising tokenized assets across multiple blockchains,” Moore said. “In that, it was successful.” It is uncertain whether public chains or mainnets will be involved in future deployments. Though this is the case, JPMorgan has been actively exploring possibilities in the blockchain technology space. Also for Project Guardian, JPMorgan processed tokenized foreign exchange trades on Polygon’s mainnet last year via a modified version of the permissioned DeFi platform Aave Arc. Most recently, it gave institutional clients more programmability over its payment offerings on its blockchain-based accounts with the JPM Coin system, allowing users to set parameters around payments based on different requirements. The bank has also been exploring on-chain digital wallets, allowing users to store and control digital identity on its platform. “Consistent with the goals of Project Guardian, we believe our POC is a critical moment at the intersection between traditional finance and blockchain technology,” JPMorgan wrote in a report. “We view our contribution to Project Guardian as the first step of a journey into the complex business of delivering higher quality discretionary investment portfolios in a thoughtful and efficient manner to improve the end investor’s experience and results.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

He once had higher hopes for CBDCs, envisioning them to be more innovative and transformative. However, he feels that they’ve essentially become mere extensions of the conventional banking system. Buterin mentioned, “I was hopeful about CBDCs about five years ago. Many aimed to integrate blockchain’s transparency, verifiability, and some level of privacy. But as these projects evolved, they seemed to shift from their initial vision. What we now see are systems that aren’t much of an improvement over our current payment methods, acting merely as a new interface for the same old banking processes.” Buterin expressed concerns over privacy, believing CBDCs won’t offer the kind of discretion one might expect from digital currencies. He emphasized that these digital currencies might grant governments and businesses increased surveillance over financial transactions. He stated, “CBDCs could erode privacy even further, weakening protections against both corporate and governmental scrutiny.” Highlighting Ethereum’s resilience, Buterin noted that it might be less susceptible to governmental intervention. He credited this to Ethereum’s transition to a proof-of-stake consensus method, explaining, “Proof-of-stake is more anonymous and difficult to disrupt than proof-of-work. The latter demands significant physical resources and power consumption, making it an easier target for authorities with experience in tracking such operations.” source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

205::https://cryptobriefing.com/ledn-q1-success-loans/::Crypto Briefing::article::Ledn's institutional loans reach $584 million in Q1::Retail loans added over $100 million, totaling $690 million.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Crypto lender Ledn has reported over $690 million in loans in the first quarter of 2024. Institutional borrowers accounted for $584 million, while retail loans comprised $100 million, with $40 million tied to refinancing following the Celsius network collapse. The surge in Ledn’s loan processing coincides with the approval of Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs in the US and a bullish BTC market. The company provided substantial loans to ETF market makers, contributing to this quarter’s success. “The first quarter of 2024 has set the tone for a promising year for Ledn, as we’ve not only doubled our loan book since November 2022 but have also solidified our leading position in the market by adapting to the increasing demand for digital asset financial products,” said Adam Reeds, CEO of Ledn. “We will continue to make every effort to educate and empower clients to make informed decisions around digital assets, and we look forward to the market continuing to place trust in us.” Following the bankruptcy of Celsius, Ledn’s refinancing program attracted significant attention, securing $40 million in refinanced loans. This represents a significant portion of the total refinanced amount, underscoring the trust the community places in Ledn. Ledn’s performance is reflective of a broader recovery in the crypto lending sector, with Coinbase also reporting a rise in loan processing in its Q4 2023 shareholder letter. Moreover, the total borrowed on decentralized applications jumped $7.1 billion in Q1, and $8.36 billion (144%) in quarter-on-quarter, according to data aggregator DefiLlama. John Glover, Ledn CIO, this movement is propelled by a demand for dollar funding. “My personal view is that this jump in loan volume is a combination of the widespread demand in Q1 for dollar funding in both TradFi and Crypto, coupled with an assumption that 2022/23 took the majority of bad actors/irresponsible management out of the ecosystem, so that the likelihood of another FTX/BlockFi event is very low.” Share this article The information on or accessed through this website is obtained from independent sources we believe to be accurate and reliable, but Decentral Media, Inc. makes no representation or warranty as to the timeliness, completeness, or accuracy of any information on or accessed through this website.

206::https://theconversation.com/plan-to-become-a-cryptoassets-hub-may-just-be-the-uk-government-hedging-its-bets-180717::The Conversation::article::Plan to become a ‘cryptoassets hub’ may just be the UK government hedging its bets::Stablecoins are less volatile, and considered a safer bet than many cryptocurrencies.::In a busy start to April 2022 for the British chancellor, Rishi Sunak announced his intention to make the UK a “global hub for cryptoassets technology”. Put simply, this means he wants the country to be an attractive place for cryptocurrency companies to operate. For the government, this requires a delicate regulatory balance between preventing financial crime and protecting consumers, and allowing cryptocurrencies to flourish. If all goes to plan, greater engagement with the sector could result in a welcome boost to the UK economy. It’s early days of course, and many central banks and economists remain unsure of the role cryptocurrencies should play in a nation’s financial makeup. But Sunak’s plans featured some eye-catching proposals, including removing tax barriers, and developing a non-fungible token (NFT) with the Royal Mint. But the key element was a proposal to bring a particular element of cryptocurrencies, “stablecoins”, within the scope of existing UK banking regulation. Stablecoins are widely considered to be at the safer end of the sector, where the notorious volatility of other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is replaced with something more reliable. So where Bitcoin’s value is derived purely from levels of confidence and demand, stablecoins are backed by other assets. Usually this means traditional currencies (usually the US dollar), but some are attached to commodities like gold. Either way, the aim is the same – to keep their value as close to constant as possible, making stablecoins more useful as a reliable medium of exchange. Stablecoins may also have attracted the UK government because they offer fast transactions, at low cost and without borders. This allows users to make speedy global transactions with individuals and businesses, without the need to exchange currencies into a local tender. Other appealing factors of stablecoins include their transparency, in that every single transaction is recorded and publicly visible. They are also (largely speaking) under centralised control, in the same way that traditional banks have control over customers’ accounts. It makes sense then, that as the UK dips its toe into cryptocurrencies, it is stablecoins which have most appeal. An alternative approach would be to introduce a central bank digital currency, as China is doing, but this is time consuming and expensive. A well-regulated stablecoin space will at least get the UK involved in the sector while the Bank of England decides whether or not to commit to a digital currency of its own. But the lack of detail around the UK proposals – what regulation will look like and what it hopes to gain – remains a concern. So too is its recent lack of progress in dealing with a huge part of the modern financial world. For example, there have been promises since 2015 about regulating of cryptoassets, with little beyond tax issues and preventing money laundering being forthcoming – and both have had a restrictive impact on the sector. The UK’s financial services regulator meanwhile, has indicated recently that it is more focused on preventing risk than helping crypto technology to flourish. Perhaps then, the UK is not as welcoming to innovation and crypto technology as it makes out. Nor has the treasury provided any clear detail about what stablecoin regulation would actually involve. Yet to encourage wider use of stablecoins it would at least need to bring in some kind of registration system and a mechanism for consumer compensation should the stablecoin ever fail. Without this, a stablecoin could indeed fail, causing major damage to the economy, the wider crypto sector and to individual investors. It is also questionable to what extent the UK can become a global crypto leader, as the most successful stablecoins all peg, to some degree, to the US dollar. (Although this could change as the US and EU adopt tougher stances on cryptocurrencies.) The UK may well hope to gain a greater foothold in the relatively safe (and controllable) world of stablecoins and enjoy the potential benefits for the pound as an underpinning currency. But in reality, it will take much more than the measures announced so far to make any meaningful progress.

207::https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/05/15/the-ethereum-staking-opportunity/::CoinDesk::article::The Ethereum Staking Opportunity::The market is just beginning and there’s a lot of room for growth, says Eliezer Ndinga, Head of Strategy and Business Development for Digital Assets at 21.co. Here’s what could drive the market.::Ethereum is the largest proof-of-stake network by market cap. Currently, 32.5 million ($99 billion) ETH has been staked, and the amount of staked ETH has grown by 78% since Ethereum’s Shanghai Upgrade in April 2023. Despite the impressive growth, only 27% of the ETH in circulation has been staked. Comparatively, other proof-of-stake networks such as Solana, Cardano, SUI, Avalanche and Aptos have a much higher staking ratio, between 48%-81%. In other words, staking on Ethereum can grow larger, potentially fueled by the adoption of Liquid Staking or Liquid Restaking Tokens on Layer 2 networks and DeFi protocols.

Source: 21co on Dune Analytics EIP 7251 to drive more volume The next Ethereum upgrade, Pectra, will likely take place by the end of 2024, or in early 2025. One of the key proposals, EIP 7251, can provide a better UX for validators to earn staking yield. This proposal will increase the max effective balance of validators from 32 to 2048. Leading staking service providers, like Coinbase, are managing more than 130,000 validators already. The lift in maximum effective balance allows these providers to consolidate the number of validators and ultimately increase efficiency and lower the cost of operation. Another benefit is that solo stakers can enjoy auto-compounding their staking rewards. At the current stage, solo stakers’ staking reward will be withdrawn to the execution layer automatically. The reward received will no longer accrue staking yield. Solo stakers will need to wait until they have 32 ETH before spinning up another validator to capture the staking reward. Restaking is the new catalyst Restaking has been an exciting primitive on Ethereum. Together with the points program from both EigenLayer and liquid restaking protocols, it creates a new wave of demand for ETH staking. In March and April 2024, respectively, 38% and 48% of the staking volume came s from liquid staking protocols. At the same time, over 65% ($9.7B) of EigenLayer’s TVL comes from native ETH, showing the level of traction that restaking is able to bring to Ethereum. With the maturity and adoption of restaking, we could see more staking volume comes from restaking and liquid restaking in the future. However, it is also important to note that restaking comes with risks, such as smart contracts and the quality of the actively validated services. Given the reward and slashing mechanism of EigenLayer has not been activated, we are yet to see the full ramifications of restaking, both good and bad.

As developers, we appreciate the significance of data, algorithms, and prediction models. Today, we will explore a tool designed to predict the future prices of cryptocurrencies—an intriguing subject for anyone involved in the blockchain industry. Let’s delve deeper into cryptocurrencies and examine how this tool can enhance our understanding of price behavior, enabling us to make more informed decisions. To predict a cryptocurrency’s price trajectory, traders employ a wide range of trading signals and technical indicators; in total more than 200 individual metrics are considered. Identifying support and resistance levels is crucial in understanding the market’s supply and demand dynamics and predicting trend reversals. Some key indicators include the Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Averages, and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). The Relative Strength Index (RSI) measures the size of a cryptocurrency’s price moves, providing insights into whether it is overvalued or undervalued. Readings above 50 indicate bullish momentum, while readings below 50 suggest a bearish sentiment. Traders rely on the RSI as a vital momentum indicator to inform their trading decisions. Moving averages offer a comprehensive perspective on cryptocurrency price charts by calculating the average closing price over a specific period. The relationship between short-term and long-term moving averages indicates the direction of the trend. A bullish trend occurs when the short-term moving average moves above the long-term one and vice versa. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), utilizing Simple Moving Averages (SMA) and Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), offers a more accurate prediction of cryptocurrency trends. By analyzing the relationship between these two indicators, traders can determine the trend’s direction and make well-informed decisions. Fundamental analysis aims to evaluate the intrinsic value of an asset. When analyzing cryptocurrencies, it is crucial to consider supply and demand dynamics. Key data points such as market capitalization and circulating supply are significant in making reasonable assumptions about future prices. The price of cryptocurrencies is primarily influenced by market supply and demand dynamics. Their growing adoption within various industries heavily influences the demand for cryptocurrencies. Significant events like protocol updates, hard forks, whale activity, institutional adoption, and political regulations significantly impact cryptocurrency prices. While predicting the future value of any cryptocurrency involves multiple factors and is not always straightforward, leveraging a combination of technical indicators and fundamental analysis can provide valuable insights. With its proprietary algorithm and comprehensive data analysis, BE[IN]CRYPTO’s Price Prediction tool equips users with the necessary tools to anticipate market movements. However, users are reminded to conduct thorough research and analysis before making any investment decisions. By leveraging Price Prediction and their knowledge, traders can navigate the dynamic cryptocurrency landscape with increased confidence.

209::https://blockworks.co/news/blockchain-security-team-communication::Blockworks::article::It’s time for blockchain security firms to join forces::Opinion: Working alongside security experts from rival firms, not only with colleagues, will minimize risk for all of crypto.::Working alongside security experts from rival firms, not only with colleagues, will minimize risk for all of crypto FLY:D/Unsplash modified by Blockworks The lack of open communication between blockchain security firms requires urgent action. Following a spate of high-profile hacks, the time to address the prevalence of multi-million-dollar hacks is severely overdue. Not even respected figureheads like Vitalik Buterin and Mark Cuban are immune, with over $1 million lost following a hacked Twitter account and wallet, respectively. Without a doubt, technical capabilities matter in securing funds against bad actors. However, there is a critical component that is being overlooked in the present: teamwork. If we are to successfully neutralize the risks of financial and reputational loss to the industry, communication and collaboration between blockchain security firms is necessary. As one prominent example, the lack of effective communication exacerbated the Curve hack this summer and should serve as an important wake-up call for the industry. Read more: Mixin halts withdrawals as network suffers $200M loss in hack Security experts faced challenges in rapidly coordinating their actions, resulting in missed opportunities for effective execution. Multiple security teams operated independently to recover and protect user funds, causing redundant efforts and a delayed response time. Due to the ambiguous nature of white hat hacking, certain security teams sought explicit permission from Curve before initiating any recovery efforts. Consequently, the attacker managed to steal funds before the coordinated white hat team could secure them. Openly discussing exploits, vulnerabilities and root causes is already the norm in traditional cybersecurity, as firms follow established protocols for the responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities. Blockchain security firms can and should adopt similar practices, ensuring that they are able to communicate vulnerabilities responsibly to relevant projects and communities to minimize risk in the most efficient way possible. Solid examples of streamlined communication seen in more traditional cybersecurity include Europol, a criminal information and intelligence database that collates information on cybercrime, making this information available to the wider public. Another example is the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE), a publicly available database listing known cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Working alongside security experts from rival firms, not only with colleagues, is a valuable approach driven by an ethos of collaboration for the greater good. One such example already in action in crypto is the Seal 911 initiative, a collective of blockchain security experts working together to offer support from within a Telegram group. So far, Seal 911’s coordinated response has helped prevent a $200,000 theft. Resources that pool information empower the community to more effectively monitor vulnerabilities and respond accordingly. However, there is no one such standardized process in Web3. Read more: Mark Cuban loses nearly $900k on MetaMask fake As the industry is still relatively nascent, this is not surprising. However, blockchain security firms should join together to create standardized protocols for common vulnerabilities for all Web3 projects — using the traditional cybersecurity resources as templates. Relying on white hat hackers in crypto has proven extremely valuable up until now, saving individual projects millions in financial losses with each hack averted. However, relying on white hat hackers alone is not an efficient catch-all strategy. The execution of a white hat strategy necessitates a costly on-chain procedure to transfer funds to a trusted third party, followed by the need for that trusted third party to return the funds to the protocol or individual users. While advertising a white hat bounty can entice the most skilled white hat hackers to solve security issues quickly, it can also inadvertently provide attackers with hints that important or sensitive work is underway. This can propagate misinformation, potentially causing confusion about whether the event is an external attack or an asset protection operation (done by internal teams). Solving security issues publicly is not always the most effective solution. Web3’s penchant for anonymity, often due to legal and regulatory pressure, can also create uncertainty, as it can be unclear how to contact a trustworthy person within a protocol. Vulnerabilities should ideally be communicated to relevant parties first, in order to allow projects a fair opportunity to correct them before disclosing vulnerabilities to a wider audience. Yet the reality is that bad actors are often tipped off inadvertently at the same time, making the situation worse. Collaboration must be embraced by blockchain security firms and experts. Only by working together cohesively can blockchain security firms establish best practices and standards for securing blockchain networks and decentralized applications.

There’s some fresh gossip suggesting that XRP might be supported by gold in Singapore and silver in the U.S. But while this sounds super interesting, there’s still no solid proof or official word on this. A lot of folks in the crypto game take these kinds of whispers seriously. If a crypto like XRP is backed by something real and tangible like gold or silver, it could make it seem more valuable and trustworthy. We all know that things like gold and silver have always been seen as reliable investments. Mixing them with modern digital money could be a game-changer. Related: XRP: Your Ticket to Financial Freedom or a Dead-End Investment? But we’ve got to keep our heads on straight. Without any solid facts, it’s wise to be a bit wary of such talk. Sometimes, rumors have a bit of truth to them, but other times they’re just baseless or even meant to stir the pot. Until we hear something legit from the big shots, like Ripple or any major authority, it’s all just talk. If you’re thinking about putting your money into this based on whispers, you better do your homework. Those who are big on crypto, especially XRP fans, will surely be watching this closely.

211::https://cryptobriefing.com/dtcc-chainlink-fund-tokenization-pilot/::Crypto Briefing::article::DTCC's pilot project with Chainlink drives blockchain data to expand fund tokenization::The pilot brings trusted fund data to blockchains, enabling fund tokenization for financial institutions.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the world’s largest securities settlement system, has completed a pilot project called Smart NAV in collaboration with blockchain oracle Chainlink (LINK). Major financial institutions from the US also participated in the pilot. According to a report published by DTCC, the pilot was initiated to establish a standardized process for bringing and disseminating net asset value (NAV) data of funds across multiple blockchains. With the standardization, the tokenization of funds becomes easier and more efficient over time. The Smart NAV pilot, which included participants such as JPMorgan, Franklin Templeton, BNY Mellon, and State Street, explored a digital extension to DTCC’s Mutual Fund Profile Service (MFPS I) to leverage distributed ledger technology (DLT) for data dissemination and consumption. By delivering structured data onchain and creating standard roles and processes, the pilot found that foundational data could be embedded into various on-chain use cases, such as tokenized funds and “bulk consumer” smart contracts, which hold data for multiple funds. The pilot successfully demonstrated the feasibility of integrating structured NAV data onto blockchains, ensuring consistency and accuracy. It also established automated data routing via smart contracts, promoting dynamic data management and preventing fragmentation through Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). Notably, the project had a limited impact on existing market practices by allowing clients to use current channels and providing automated access to historical data without manual record-keeping. Clients involved in the project gained the ability to consume price and rate data in real-time through new interfaces, including APIs and smart contracts. The new data consumption methods include real-time API services and smart contracts designed for single funds or bulk fund groups, enabling instant updates and facilitating various use cases, such as automated portfolio rebalancing. Once fully deployed, the Smart NAV would open opportunities for expanding the scope of data dissemination to include key reference data and other blockchain-triggered workflows. Such an infrastructure would provide the foundation for more streamlined and efficient operational processes across the financial industry, as tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) such as bonds, funds, and other traditional investments has become one of the most sought-after use cases for blockchain technology.

212::https://theconversation.com/bitcoin-is-helping-both-sides-in-ukraine-conflict-but-it-wont-wreck-russian-sanctions-178442::The Conversation::article::Bitcoin is helping both sides in Ukraine conflict, but it won’t wreck Russian sanctions::What bitcoin giveth, it also takes away.::War is expensive. The United States spent about US$1.1 trillion (£830 billion) on the 2003 Iraq war in today’s money, while the Falklands war cost the UK the equivalent of about £2.6 billion. Funding is therefore an important resource in any conflict, similar to that of artillery, fuel and boots on the ground. The burden of finance traditionally falls to governments, often in the form of issuing war bonds. Ukraine is currently issuing US$270 million in war bonds for that very purpose. Interestingly, however, Ukraine is also drawing on options that were not available until very recently. Several days after the Russian invasion, Mykhailo Fedorov, vice prime minister of Ukraine and minister of digital transformation, called on people around the world to show solidarity with Ukraine by making crypto donations.   At the time of writing, donations have exceeded US$50 million. This may not be in the same league as the value of the war bonds or the financial aid and military assistance being offered by governments around the world, but it’s not insignificant. It shows individuals collectively having a state-like impact on the global stage. This new way of accessing global private capital is a refreshingly welcome facet of cryptocurrencies. By going straight to the people of the world, Ukraine’s government has been able to raise finance quickly without the need for financial intermediaries. Yet as ever with cryptocurrencies, they bring benefits and risks in equal measures. They also have the potential to help Russians to evade the crashing rouble – contrary to demands by Ukraine. Mykhailo Fedorov, for example, pleaded on Twitter for, “all major crypto exchanges to block addresses of Russian users … It’s crucial to freeze not only the addresses linked to Russian and Belarusian politicians, but also to sabotage ordinary users”. The crypto community has not wholeheartedly agreed. One leading Twitter user, David Gokhshtein, replied that he is, “definitely with Ukraine and for peace but we don’t do that in crypto”. Changpeng Zhao, founder of leading exchange Binance, has said that it’s not the place of crypto exchanges to restrict Russian activities in general, though he emphasised that his exchange was not permitting any of the hundreds of wealthy Russian individuals on western sanctions lists to use its services. Even then, he said, it was impossible to stop them because there were so many other exchanges that they could use instead. With Russians also being restricted by moving money out of the country both by sanctions on Russian banks and capital controls imposed by their own government, many appear to be attempting to throw off the shackles of their national virtual identity to get around these rules. Russian demand for VPNs, which help individuals to stay private online when using public networks, was up at least fourfold over the weekend, and possibly a good deal more. Russian demand for crypto may already help to explain bitcoin’s rise by about 15% since the weekend, currently trading at around US$43,500. Leading altcoins such as ethereum (+12%), ripple (+7%) and solana (+18%) have also been on the way up. There are also questions about how crypto could affect the sanctions regime as a whole, which not only includes restrictions on Russian banks and oligarchs but also a freeze on the US$630 billion foreign reserves of the Russian central bank. Could Russian institutions get around these restrictions by using cryptocurrencies? The problem is not new to this conflict. Countries such as Iran have previously been accused of using bitcoin to bypass sanctions. Nonetheless, as the global community looks ever more fractured by ideology and past grievances, concerns about Russia are of a different order. In my view, however, it is doubtful that crypto will save Russia from sanctions. Even apart from the huge task of establishing the necessary facilities within Russian banks, many of the people and institutions that would be receiving the crypto would need to set up wallets of their own. Besides that, daily transaction values in crypto only amount to a few billion dollars. This is a big number, but an order of magnitude less than the overall financial system. If Russia were to seriously start using crypto for payments, the market is not yet mature enough to cope. Having said that, it’s worth noting that thanks to the devaluation of the rouble, bitcoin has now eclipsed it in overall value. It is now the 14th most valuable currency in the world, three places above the rouble. It is possible that the positives that crypto has brought to this war will be a step towards it becoming more widely accepted and for the world to come up with the harmonised global regulation vital for it to fully reach the mainstream. On the other hand, it is clearly already difficult to prevent crypto from being used as a way of evading sanctions on a relatively small scale, and it has the potential to make it much harder to financially restrict pariah countries in years to come.::2022-03-03T13:32:21Z::Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, Ethereum, Russia, Sanctions, Ukraine::Gavin Brown::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/449803/original/file-20220303-6135-c62nsg.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=221%2C262%2C5209%2C2604&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

He is a speaker at this year’s Consensus festival in Austin, Texas, May 29-31.::It’s quite likely that Otoh has lost more bitcoin than most people will ever hold. An early bitcoin investor, Otoh, a pseudonym that stands for “on the other hand,” has many lessons to share about finding opportunities and making one’s own luck. Otoh is a speaker at this year’s Consensus festival, in Austin, Texas, May 29-31. Scheduled to speak on stage at Consensus 2024, in Austin, Texas, alongside crypto luminaries like Litecoin creator Charlie Lee and BTCC and Ballet founder Bobby Lee, Otoh is known among the early crypto crowd for his massive holdings of physical bitcoins – a.k.a. Casascius coins. “I've never sold any. I’ve just been accumulating them as my version of a cold storage,” Otoh told CoinDesk in an interview, discussing his recent auction of over 200 worth of physical bitcoins in what was the Heritage auction firm’s first crypto sale. Casascius coins, created by Mike Caldwell (who went by Casascius, an acronym for “call a spade a spade,” on Bitcoin forums), were a solution to spending bitcoin in face-to-face transactions by embedding a Bitcoin private key in a metal coin. The last ones were made in 2013 after the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network told Caldwell that he was operating an unlicensed money transmitter business. There are only about 90,000 Casascius coins in circulation, of varying denominations, though other manufacturers including Bobby Lee created their own versions. A part of Bitcoin lore and its physical history, Casascius coins are now sought after by collectors (some are so valuable that they have to be declared to U.S. Customs when entering the country). In some sense, these coins are the most long lived and recognizable image of the purely a digital currency. “It seemed the right time to let some of the physical coins go,” Otoh said. “Let other people look after them and enjoy having them.” Of course, part of the danger of bringing bitcoin into the physical realm is that it makes the assets as easy to steal as a $20 note from mom’s purse – and unfortunately, Otoh thinks he was the victim of a theft about a decade ago. He recounted a story of receiving a shipment of coins where the box had been obviously tampered with. The 55 BTC missing from his collection were worth about $20,000 at the time they were purchased, and are now worth about $3.5 million, “which is a huge sum in most anyone's book,” he said. “I'm very happy to offer a half a million dollar reward for their return. And unconditionally, I wouldn't want to press charges if someone decided to give them back to me,” he added. See also: Why, for Some, Crypto Is the Defining Political Issue of Our Times | Opinion CoinDesk caught up with Otoh ahead of Consensus to discuss his recent auction of vintage physical bitcoins, early investments in other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum’s initial coin offering and how he manages his wealth by diversifying into properties around the world and residing in a tax haven in the British Channel Islands. Could you give a sense of what you’re talking about at Consensus? I’m on the panel about physical bitcoins. I'm basically a fill-in for Mike Caldwell, who invented Casascius coins, who couldn't make it unfortunately. Oh, that's so cool. Would be nice to meet him one day. Bobby Lee and Charlie Lee asked if I'd be a substitute for the gap on the panel because I am a large investor. Do you remember buying your first coin? Yes, very much. It was at the London Bitcoin Conference in 2012. I had just started on bitcoin in the summer of 2011, around July. I remember at the time I met with some German guys – there were all these privacy advocates wearing masks who had a whole bunch of physical coins to sell. I believe it was 10 regular bitcoins and a 10 bitcoin unit piece. The price at the time, with the premium and everything, was $12 a bitcoin. What does Otoh stand for? It’s an acronym for “on the other hand.” That's how it's usually used. I just adopted it because I find myself, a lot of the time, not necessarily being argumentative but looking at different viewpoints. I thought bitcoin and crypto is also a different way of looking at finance. Nearly everyone had a nickname on the BitcoinTalk forum. That's the way that came about, but I didn't give it much thought at the time. It was just the first thing that came into my head. Are there any particular memories of the early days of Bitcoin that you remember fondly? Fondly? Yes, that must be getting my first coin – that was a big deal. At the time people were still giving away free coins. By the time I joined, word had spread, and it often wasn't a full coin anymore, just a fraction of a coin, but it was still fun to have my own address and then be sent this little token amount of coins to see how it could function. At the time I was traveling between Europe and the States quite a bit and also buying and selling in Europe and the States. With bitcoin, it suddenly became really easy to send money. A few of the other memories are more traumatic. It's very easy to mess up. As you learn as you go. You've probably lost more bitcoins than most people have today. If you count the ones that were stolen off me. Like that list I just gave you that I put together from nine years ago. Somewhere out there there is a lost, stolen treasure of a few million dollars. What do you suspect happened there? A rogue employee? I think it is most likely a rogue U.S. Postal Service employee who just used a box cutter and saw something that looked promising. He probably thought it was Gold Eagles or Silver Eagles or something. I don't know what the reaction would be, whether they were disgusted to see it was just some weird tokens and threw them away or whether they thought “Oh, this looks cool.” I’ve always hoped that I’d have a brainstorm and remember if I’ve stashed them away somewhere. But it doesn't make any sense – I've got everything else very well looked after and itemized. A friend of mine whose house I had been staying in at that time remembers receiving a box that was cut open and resealed. Is there anything that you want to say about the OTOH Collection of Physical Cryptocurrency? Well, after a decade, I decided it's time to sell. I've never sold any, I’ve just been accumulating them as my version of a cold storage. Now that I've sold all my digital crypto, it seemed the right time to let some of the physical coins go. Let other people look after them and enjoy having them. You're also a real estate investor. At this point, do you think it’s better for people to invest in bitcoin or physical property? I think it’s a mixture of the two. Bitcoin is high-risk, but potentially it has very high returns. And property is a hedge. It's a safety net. It's also very hard to steal, whereas bitcoins can be very easy to steal. If I was still in my 20s, then I'd probably be keeping a much higher percentage in crypto, but nowadays I like the security of having a bunch of properties and enjoy renovating them. Are you interested in other digital assets? In the past I pretty much have been. I was the largest holder of litecoin (LTC) when it was a few cents. I think I had roughly 600,000. It was the first altcoin, and was quite controversial with Bitcoin Maximalists. They disliked it intensely because they thought it withdrew funds and interest away from Bitcoin. But I was quite convinced from the first time I saw it, it's impossible for anything to exist without its opposite. And so that paid out very well. After Litecoin, I moved into Dash and was the largest holder of those and helped develop the project in some ways. And then I kind of lost interest and moved onto other things. I was highly recommended Ethereum at a Dutch conference and participated in the ICO. I got 100 bitcoins worth, which was 210,000 ether (ETH). Unfortunately, I sold those way too soon. I made 100% or 200% profit, but I sold them for something like $2. So I will rue the potential $800 million there. Otherwise I'm pretty much fully bitcoin nowadays. The way you discussed bitcoin earlier in the conversation you discussed it mostly as a method of transaction. Are you convinced by the arguments that it has properties like gold? I think it is excellent as an investment. I think that's its main use at the moment. It’s perhaps the best performing investment in history, and it continues to grow. It is a trillion dollar asset class, and a great way to store value. Satoshi viewed it in the beginning as a hedge against the degenerate behavior of central governments and banks abusing the currencies that we will have to use every day. It's much more versatile than gold, in that it can be transferred pretty much anywhere around the world from anyone to anyone, instantly, with no armored trucks or anything and next to no fees. It's quite miraculous really, that it's come into existence. It's still very early days, but it really has transformed the world in many many ways. What have been your biggest purchases made with crypto? I must admit I've done very little with buying and selling with crypto. I go from fiat currency into crypto and then back out to fiat currency. Capital gains taxes make spending crypto sort of annoying, to some extent. For many people it would, yes. I'm fortunate that I am based in a tax haven where there isn't any capital gains tax. I make sure that I'm physically there when I cash any out. So I don't have that issue. There's also no income tax. You mentioned you have a home in California. How do you balance the tax situation there, where state tax authorities may want to charge you income tax? I’ve got homes in many countries around the world; it doesn't mean I'm suddenly a tax resident. I make sure I count my days very carefully – I don’t overstay. As long as I'm not here for more than six months of the year, I won't be liable for any tax. And I don't do any business here. Do you mind if I ask what tax haven? It’s a little island in the British Channel Islands called Sark. It’s a three square mile island and fairly unique in the world for having next to no tax. You just pay a small proportion of your property tax as a contribution to the kind of upkeep of the island. The main thing about it that's attractive is you don't have to keep records of what you're doing, which would have been hugely complicated when I was converting altcoins into bitcoin and then into other alternative currencies and then back into dollars. I pity the people who had to try and keep these records and then present them to a tax authority – it must be a nightmare. Did you give up your passport? No, I still keep a U.K. passport. I could trade it in for a Guernsey passport, which is the main island in the channel. It's really just a clone of the U.K.. It has all the same benefits, but I haven't bothered to do it. It doesn't really matter what nationality I have. It really only matters where I'm a fiscal resident. How would you describe your political views? Well, like many people, with age I probably have become a little more conservative in some ways. But I'm pretty much a capitalist; I believe that's a good way for people to behave. I'm not overtly political. I was probably quite anarchist in the past. I just adapt to whatever the majority believes. I am not trying to change things myself in a big way – I’m pretty apolitical. Is there anything more you want to say about the possible theft of those Casascius coins? I believe it was 55 bitcoins in value, something like $3.5 million at present value. At the time they were lost or taken they were only worth about $13,000. Still a lot but nothing compared to right now. So I'm very happy to offer a half a million dollar reward for their return. And unconditionally, I wouldn't want to press charges if someone decided to give them back to me.

Everyone can see the addresses; I was really surprised when I checked a couple of weeks ago that they had never been moved and that they hadn't been peeled. So they're probably out there somewhere. Last question, what are you looking forward to at Consensus? Well, meeting Bobby Lee and Charlie Lee again. They both in their own ways have been very instrumental in helping me with my crypto journey. Charlie Lee by inventing Litecoin, where I did extremely well – probably even better than I did with bitcoin. And Bobby Lee for having BTCC (also known as BTCChina) and the physical coins. He produced physical coins just like Mike's Casascius coins. I have still got all my BTCC coins. That will be a future auction. I've had quite a few adventures with the physical coins. I had to physically go to Shanghai to pick them up, as they couldn't be shipped at the time. That was an adventure in itself. There's other people that I know from forums and interacting with on the internet who I'm sure it would be nice to see again in person if I've met them at other conferences. It's a chance to put people together and exchange ideas that if one just sat behind a computer at home, perhaps wouldn't happen. So I'm looking forward to it. It's quite exciting. It's my first visit to Texas. Disclosure Please note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.

214::https://ambcrypto.com/whale-watch-heres-what-bitcoins-big-players-are-doing-this-week/::AMBCrypto::article::Whale Watch – Here’s what Bitcoin’s big players are doing this week::Despite BTC’s recent price troubles, over 90% of its holders are in profit right now. ::Despite BTC’s recent price troubles, over 90% of its holders are in profit right now.  Bitcoin’s [BTC] whale activity has cratered to its lowest level since the beginning of the year. This, as the crypto developed resistance and support levels around the $65,000-price level on the charts. In fact, data obtained from Santiment revealed that over the past week, only 60,193 BTC transactions exceeded $100,000, marking its lowest count since the final week of 2023. Also, the number of BTC whales that hold over 100 coins has dropped by 0.48% in the last two months – An update possibly signifying a steady uptick in profit-taking activity among this investor category.  Source: Santiment Since it rallied to an all-time high of $73,750, BTC’s price has fallen on the charts. In doing so, BTC hit a string of lower highs to form a descending triangle. Now, although it breached the upper trend line of this triangle in April when it reclaimed the $70,000-zone, the king coin’s price has traded within this triangle over the past three months. Source: BTC/USDT on TradingView This price decline might be why BTC whales have reduced the volume of their transactions over the past few weeks. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $65,696, sitting above the upper trend line of the triangle. When an asset’s price breaks above the top of a descending triangle, it is considered a bullish signal. This suggests a shift in buying power as the bulls step in to overcome the existing selling pressure. Confirming the shift in attitude towards BTC, its weighted sentiment returned a positive value of 0.99 too. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-25 The shift in trend might have been precipitated by the fact that despite BTC’s recent price troubles, daily traders continue to record profit on their investments. AMBCrypto assessed the daily ratio of BTC’s transaction volume in profit to loss using a 30-day moving average and found that it returned a value of 1.21. This means that for every BTC transaction that ended in a loss over the past month, 1.21 transactions returned profits. Source: Santiment At the time of writing, 50 million wallet addresses, which comprise 93.09% of all BTC holders, were “in the money.” Only 4% of all coin holders seemed to hold at a loss. According to data from IntoTheBlock, this group consists of coin holders who bought BTC between $67,000 and 72,000.

To learn more on how we evaluate each piece of content, please proceed to our verification methodology page Azuro has launched a new decentralized betting protocol built on blockchain technology. The innovative protocol packs a one-two punch of smart contracts that automatically handle bets and DAO governance, where the community calls the shots. While Azuro is indeed a promising new player, does it have enough clout to disrupt established giants? Can it truly revolutionize sports betting? We explore these questions and more in this detailed guide. Azuro is an on-chain prediction layer for EVM chains. It offers a suite of modular tools, oracle solutions, and liquidity management for developers building on EVM-compatible blockchains. This modular approach allows for the creation of powerful prediction and gaming applications. At its core, Azuro is an innovative infrastructure and liquidity layer specifically designed for on-chain predictions. It brings along a unique liquidity pool design called the Liquidity Tree, which dynamically maintains and creates market liquidity. In other words, this unique design of the liquidity pool keeps the betting action flowing smoothly by constantly adapting to handle new sports markets and all sorts of games. The best part is that anyone can get in on the action. Azuro’s open framework allows developers to create new apps, features, and even entirely new betting products, all built on top of Azuro’s foundation. The Azuro Protocol consists of a suite of smart contracts that can be constantly upgraded. These smart contracts work together like building blocks to enable anyone to create their own prediction apps and games. Azuro offers pre-built components that make creating applications on its protocol an easy task. Want to dive deeper? Yo ucan check the audits of Azuro smart contracts here. The Azuro DAO is the brain trust behind the whole operation. It is powered by an AZUR token, which gives the community a say in how things work. This means more community involvement and decision-making — the power is in the people’s hands! One of Azuro’s biggest strengths is its approach to money. By combining resources into one big pool, Azuro offers deeper liquidity than traditional betting options. Its tooling and Oracle solutions are designed to work smoothly across any blockchain, starting with those compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Moreover, Azuro’s open design philosophy means that launching a prediction site or app is not only cost-effective but also risk-free and achievable in just a few hours. Overall, Azuro isn’t just about picking winners and losers. Rather, it’s about rethinking risk, ownership, and how we participate in betting in this blockchain era. It brings along a giant pool of resources to attract users and power a sophisticated platform for decentralized predictions and gaming. Azuro aims to compete with traditional betting giants like Stake.com by focusing on community-driven solutions and breaking down barriers. Azuro’s betting action revolves around its Prediction Engines, a complex system governed by smart contracts. These contracts are not just the brains behind creating conditions — they also handle the nitty-gritty, such as processing bets, calculating payouts, and even rewarding affiliates. These engines are plugged into the pool through something called the Factory. The Factory contract facilitates the deployment of Pools and their corresponding Betting Engines. This way, the platform ensures that all betting activities are managed securely via the LP contract. A look at the core components of Azuro’s blockchain architecture: Azuro currently has two engine types: Both engines inherit their core logic from the CoreBase contract, which serves as the platform’s foundation for all multi-outcome betting action. Every market on a Pool within the Azuro ecosystem is called a Condition. Data providers manage these Conditions, which are basically information packets containing everything you need to know about a bet. This includes game details, odds, potential payouts, and even how much money is backing each side (reinforcement) and the house commission (margin). A pre-match Condition might include specifics like the game ID, how much you’d win on each outcome, virtual funds used to set the odds, and the total bets placed. This level of transparency ensures a fair and reliable betting experience for everyone. A Pool in Azuro is essentially a cohesive system of smart contracts that forms the backbone of the betting platform. Anyone can deploy a Pool using the Factory contract, which includes the LP contract (the main gateway to the Pool’s operations) and the Access contract (which facilitates easy control over the Pool’s functions by its owner). This structure allows the Pool owner to integrate an unlimited number of Betting Engines, which further improves the platform’s flexibility and functionality. Odds in Azuro aren’t just numbers — they’re the essence of every bet that tells you you how much you stand to win versus what you put down. Here’s how it works: odds are calculated by comparing the total pool of money in a Condition to the funds allocated for each specific outcome. This calculation creates a dynamic system where the odds evolve as bets are placed. This way, it ensures that the betting environment remains fair and reactive. Initially, the platform sets the odds using the virtual funds distributed among the outcomes when the Condition is first created. As the game progresses and more bets roll in, these odds are fine-tuned to match the changing landscape. Doing so ensures that every bettor is on a level playing field. Reinforcement acts as Azuro’s financial safety net. It allocates initial liquidity to each game depending on the betting odds at setup. This way, it makes sure that there’s always enough money to cover wins. This method caps the pool’s potential losses, demonstrating Azuro’s proactive approach to risk management. Azuro’s liquidity borrows heavily from the segment tree design from computer science. The unique structure makes cash handling seamless. Each deposit becomes a “leaf,” part of a bigger tree that offers a real-time snapshot of where money stands. Add, pull out, or shuffle funds around for games — it’s all streamlined to keep the betting smooth and steady. This innovative peer-to-pool model supports thousands of liquid betting markets. It offers competitive odds and a rich set of features, including accumulators and multi-outcome bets. Additionally, it also transforms the blockchain betting experience by aligning it closely with traditional sportsbook offerings. Azuro’s Liquidity Tree not only enhances betting dynamics but also sets the stage for the growth of specialized prediction markets. Virtual Funds are crucial — they gauge how likely an outcome might be. The bigger the pot for an outcome, the slimmer the odds of it. As bets come in, these funds adjust on the fly, keeping the odds fresh and fair. It’s a built-in balancing act that ditches the need for manual tweaks and keeps the odds honest, protecting the heart of the betting action. As of late April 2024, Azura has so far raked in a net revenue of nearly $3 million. The total transaction volume on Azuro is approaching the $300 million milestone. Total number of transactions on the platform has surpassed 4.3 million, of which about 481,000 was in March 2023 alone. Azure boasts more than 22,000 unique users thus far, with more than 2,000 active monthly users on average. The platform boasts a network of nearly 4,500 liquidity providers, locking over $8 million in total value (TVL). Azuro announced the successful closure of its pre-launch funding in April 2024. The company confirmed that it had raised $11 million in total from several investors, including the likes of Fenbushi Capital, SevenX Ventures, Polymorphic Capital, Arrington Capital, and G1 Ventures. Red Beard Ventures, and Dewhales. This round was preceded by a strategic funding round of $4 million in 2022, which brought the total funds raised by the company up to the point to $7.5 million. “This new investment round arrives at a critical development stage for Azuro. We have recently entered the third phase of the Azuro Score program, the final step before the $AZUR launch,” Azuro is actively forging partnerships with key industry players to further polish and expand its offering. Thus far, efforts have been largely successful, with the platform joining forces with several leading blockchain and crypto companies. For instance, in January 2023, Azuro teamed up with Polygon. This move quickly bore fruit and Azuro’s monthly volumes soared to nearly $30 million, spread across about 500,000 transactions. By February 2024, Azuro emerged as the biggest revenue generator on Polygon PoS, which marked a significant milestone in accessibility and growth. Similarly, the platform’s partnership with Gnosis helps revolutionize the user experience. It keeps network fees low for high-volume, low-value transactions characteristic of games and prediction markets. On Gnosis Chain, fees are paid in xDai stablecoin, which significantly cuts down on volatility and streamlines transactions for users. The Graph is another of Azuro’s key strategic partners. Azuro leverages Graph’s powerful APIs to ensure data transparency. This alliance empowers users with real-time access to comprehensive market data, transforming how they interact with and understand the betting landscape. Similarly, In April 2024, Azuro announced a partnership with deBridge to address chain bridging, a key user experience challenge. The new collaboration integrates deBridge’s bridging and swapping solutions into applications built on Azuro’s infrastructure. This simplifies the transaction process for users on the Polygon and Gnosis networks by allowing them to move assets between blockchains more efficiently. These are just the proverbial tip of the iceberg when it comes to Azuro’s strategic partnerships. The company is actively pursuing new collaborations to expand its global betting market footprint. Azuro’s effort to shine the light on the follies of conventional betting platforms and its ability to bypass those weaknesses using blockchain technology has yielded a net positive result. The future of on-chain betting holds considerable promise so long as it can capitalize on the inherent strengths of cryptocurrencies. Some of these strengths include open design and the ability to create innovative financial applications. Azuro has uniquely positioned itself to leverage these strengths. The ecosystem offers a fertile ground for groundbreaking advancements, with possibilities for introducing entirely new risk layers to existing games, applications, and even the metaverse. Azuro leverages blockchain technology to offer a decentralized betting protocol, which is significantly different from traditional betting platforms. It uses smart contracts and a DAO governance model to ensure that operations are automated and the community has control over decision-making. This setup enhances transparency and empowers users, which is a stark contrast to the centralized nature of traditional betting systems. Azuro ensures fair betting by using a system called the Liquidity Tree, which adjusts the betting liquidity as needed to keep operations smooth. Additionally, each betting condition is transparently managed with clear information about the bets, odds, and payouts. This approach ensures that all participants have equal access to essential data. Yes, Azuro allows anyone with the technical know-how to create their own betting products using its platform. It offers an open framework and a suite of tools that enable developers to build and deploy new apps and features quickly. Azuro also offers pre-built components that make creating applications on their protocol really easy.

216::https://blockworks.co/news/fintech-blockchain-breakthrough::Blockworks::article::Fintech has hit a wall. Blockchain will break through it.::Opinion: Relatively soon, blockchain will become the only part of fintech that matters.::Relatively soon, blockchain will become the only part of fintech that matters. TrifonenkoIvan/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks Financial technology has been an incredible growth sector for investors and innovators. But relatively soon, blockchain will become the only part of fintech that matters. The success story of fintech over the past 15 years has been defined by tremendous developments on the part of electronic and online payments systems, with companies like PayPal, Venmo and Stripe becoming household brands. (Not to mention the evolution of monoliths like American Express, Visa and Mastercard.) Only three years ago, venture funding for fintech companies topped $140 billion. But since then, investment in the sector, particularly in early-stage rounds, has dwindled to levels not seen since Barack Obama was in the White House, totalling a mere $25 billion in 2023. Caveat: I’m a huge admirer of fintech. It’s where I’ve spent most of my career, first at Braintree (acquired by PayPal), and later heading up Product at Venmo. I’ve seen firsthand how these companies have transformed societal habits around money. But after diving down the rabbit hole with smart contracts and crypto, it became clear to me that blockchain is the new foundation we’ve been looking for to create a new global financial system. Building anything involving traditional finance payments is complex and requires developers to take on a lot of scope — collecting user data, integrating payments and handling security, risk and compliance. If any one of those components is deficient, the entire system is doomed to fail. That’s a lot of responsibility for any project, and often requires small armies of developers to sustain. So much time and resources are invested in overcoming risk-and-compliance barriers that you rarely see real innovation in building fintech products. Ultimately, many of these barriers relate to the complex web of regulations and requirements that have only become more complex as fintech has grown. Blockchains not only solve those problems, but preclude them. Universal accounts mean there is no need to collect user data. Blockchains’ public and immutable ledger offers a single, universal and flexible payment system. Self-custody means developers can’t access user funds, which significantly simplifies considerations around security, risk and compliance. In short, blockchain has eliminated many of the responsibilities that developers normally have to take on to build applications. That enables small teams to deliver uniquely valuable products to millions of people. Just consider the impact that DEX pioneers like Uniswap and dYdX have had, springing from the heads of individual founders to quickly rival large corporate centralized exchanges in terms of trade volume, and then continuing to maintain absurdly small development teams thereafter. Critics like to claim that crypto developers “don’t want to follow the rules,” but the reality is that blockchains and public key cryptography make many of the old rules irrelevant. As a sector, crypto is burdened with regulatory inconsistencies and blind spots, of course. Applying old rules to new systems that have radically different characteristics was never going to make sense. Innovation in fintech is being held back by the increasingly obsolescent traditional financial system. Blockchain gives fintech a new future because it is developing from a far stronger technical foundation where the possibilities have only just begun to be explored.

Currently more than 40% of the operations carried out in the main world stock exchanges are operated by automatic robots (according to the digital newspaper lainformacion.com). The cryptocurrency ecosystem was until recently an unexplored terrain for this type of operations, where the most that could be done was to automate some orders on the exchanges. That’s why DeepTradeBot has developed a series of complex AI and big data tools that will allow us to explore a whole new world of possibilities with little risk. Please Note: This is a Press Release DeepTradeBot is a collection of automated trading tools developed by Deep Neuro Networks LTD, a London, England-based company dedicated to artificial intelligence and cloud computing. Here we find the first advantage, we are dealing with a legal company, registered in a safe country within Europe. They have a contact telephone number (attended in English). The investment is based on analyzing a large amount of data, designing a strategy, and then carrying out the actions that follow that strategy. This is something very easy to say, but very difficult to do. First of all, we humans find ourselves with our limited capacity to process data (as an example, the main artificial intelligences have defeated the human being in disciplines of pure analysis such as chess). Secondly, human beings make mistakes derived from our emotions, which often lead us away from the method or make us perceive the data analyzed in the wrong way. To these factors we must add fatigue, mistakes, and a long etcetera. Therefore, trading robots are a perfect tool to help us achieve higher returns for our investment. DeepTradeBot will operate on major cryptocurrency exchanges in 24/7 format. To take full advantage of all the opportunities of AI, 4 types of robot actions are managed according to the market situation: Earning by investing in DeepTradeBot is very simple. Its platform is designed to facilitate the entire process so that all we have to do is register, select the type of investment and the number of bots we want to put to work for us. And artificial intelligence will do the rest. In the following table we can see the options available right now on the platform. Neurons are the unit that has been created to simplify the measurement of computing power to which we have access. It is obtained from relevant parameters such as the dedicated computing time, the number of layers of the dedicated neural network and the amount of connection resources dedicated to reading and sending the information. It is very interesting to note that we have a free version that will allow us to test the platform, although of course it will be much less powerful than the other options. More information and full contract conditions are available on its website.

218::https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-etf-holdings-increase/::Crypto Briefing::article::Bitcoin ETFs attract 937 professional firms in Q1: K33 Research::Institutional capital favors larger ETFs like ARKB and HODL.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) appeared in 937 professional firms’ 13F filings in the US, shared Vetle Lunde, senior analyst at K33 Research. In stark contrast, gold ETFs only saw investments from 95 professional firms in the same period, according to data from Bitwise. Retail investors continue to hold the majority of the float, but professional investors accounted for over $11 billion in exposure by quarter’s end, which is 18.7% of the total Bitcoin ETF assets under management (AUM). The trend indicates that larger ETFs are generally more attractive to institutional investors. Notably, ARKB and HODL ETFs have experienced a higher degree of institutional backing, largely due to allocations from prominent firms such as ARK and VanEck. Among the professional firms that held Bitcoin ETF shares are JPMorgan, UBS, and Wells Fargo. Even the State of Wisconsin Investment Board revealed its holdings of over $99 million worth of BlackRock’s IBIT at the end of the first quarter. However, as highlighted by Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, the 13F Forms are a “snapshot” of these institutions’ holdings as of March 31, and they don’t account for short positions and derivatives. After the US inflation numbers came within the expected, investors turned to ETFs again. As reported by the X user Lookonchain, 9 ETFs added 3,893 BTC to their holdings, which is nearly $256 million. Grayscale’s GBTC registered an outflow of 839 BTC, while Fidelity added 1,989 BTC to its holdings. BlackRock’s IBIT is inching closer to GBTC, falling less than 14,000 BTC short with its 274,755 BTC under management.

219::https://theconversation.com/international-ransomware-gangs-are-evolving-their-techniques-the-next-generation-of-hackers-will-target-weaknesses-in-cryptocurrencies-211233::The Conversation::article::International ransomware gangs are evolving their techniques. The next generation of hackers will target weaknesses in cryptocurrencies::What will ransomware attackers focus on next?::In May 2023, the Dallas City Government was hugely disrupted by a ransomware attack. Ransomware attacks are so-called because the hackers behind them encrypt vital data and demand a ransom in order to get the information decrypted. The attack in Dallas put a halt to hearings, trials and jury duty, and the eventual closure of the Dallas Municipal Court Building. It also had an indirect effect on wider police activities, with stretched resources affecting the ability to deliver, for example, summer youth programmes. The criminals threatened to publish sensitive data, including personal information, court cases, prisoner identities and government documents. One might imagine an attack on a city government and police force causing widespread and lengthy disruption would be headline news. But ransomware attacks are now so common and routine that most pass with barely a ripple of attention. One notable exception happened in May and June 2023 when hackers exploited a vulnerability in the Moveit file transfer app which led to data theft from hundreds of organisations around the world. That attack grabbed headlines, perhaps because of the high profile victims, reported to include British Airways, the BBC and the chemist chain Boots. According to one recent survey, ransomware payments have nearly doubled to US$1.5 million (£1.2 million) over the past year, with the highest-earning organisations the most likely to pay attackers. Sophos, a British cybersecurity firm, found that the average ransomware payment rose from US$812,000 the previous year. The average payment by UK organisations in 2023 was even higher than the global average, at US$2.1 million. Meanwhile, in 2022 The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) issued new guidance urging organisations to bolster their defences amid fears of more state-sponsored cyber attacks linked to the conflict in Ukraine. It follows a series of cyber attacks in Ukraine which are suspected to have involved Russia, which Moscow denies. This article is part of Conversation Insights The Insights team generates long-form journalism derived from interdisciplinary research. The team is working with academics from different backgrounds who have been engaged in projects aimed at tackling societal and scientific challenges. In reality, not a week goes by without attacks affecting governments, schools, hospitals, businesses and charities, all over the world. These attacks have significant financial and societal costs. They can affect small businesses, as well as huge corporations, and can be particularly devastating for those involved. Ransomware is now widely acknowledged as a major threat and challenge to modern society. You can listen to more articles from The Conversation, narrated by Noa, here. Yet ten years ago it was nothing more than a theoretical possibility and niche threat. The way in which it has quickly evolved, fuelling criminality and causing untold damage should be of major concern. The ransomware “business model” has become increasingly sophisticated with, for instance, advances in malware attack vectors, negotiation strategies and the structure of criminal enterprise itself. There is every expectation that criminals will continue to adapt their strategies and cause widespread damage for many years to come. That’s why it is vital that we study the ransomware threat and preempt these tactics so as to mitigate the long-term threat – and that is exactly what our research team is doing. Prediction of global ransomware damage costs - source: Cyber Security Ventures For many years our research has looked to preempt this evolving threat by exploring new strategies that ransomware criminals can use to extort victims. The aim is to forewarn, and be ahead of the game, without identifying specifics that could be used by criminals. In our latest research, which has been peer reviewed and will be published as part of the International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security (ARES), we have identified a novel threat that exploits vulnerabilities in cryptocurrencies. Ransomware can mean subtly different things in different contexts. In 1996, Adam Young and Mordechai “Moti” Yung at Columbia University described the basic form of a ransomware attack as follows: Criminals breach the cybersecurity defences of the victim (either through tactics like phishing emails or using an insider/rogue employee). Once the criminals have breached the victim’s defences they deploy the ransomware. The main function of which is to encrypt the victim’s files with a private key (which can be thought of as a long string of characters) to lock the victim out of their files. The third stage of an attack now begins with the criminal demanding a ransom for the private key. The simple reality is that many victims pay the ransom, with ransoms potentially into the millions of dollars. Using this basic characterisation of ransomware it is possible to distinguish different types of attack. At one extreme we there are the “low level” attacks where files are not encrypted or criminals do not attempt to extract ransoms. But at the other extreme attackers make considerable efforts to maximise disruption and extract a ransom. The WannaCry ransomware attack in May 2017 is such an example. The attack, linked to the North Korean government, made no real attempt to extract ransoms from victims. Nevertheless, it led to widespread disruption across the world, including to the UK’s NHS, with some cybersecurity risk-modelling organisations even saying the global economic losses going into the billions. It is difficult to discern motive in this case, but, generally speaking, political intent, or simple error on the part of the attackers may contribute to the lack of coherent value-extraction through extortion. Our research focuses on the second extreme of ransomware attacks in which criminals look to coerce money from their victims. This does not preclude a political motive. Indeed, there is evidence of links between major ransomware groups and the Russian state. We can distinguish the degree to which ransomware attacks are motivated by financial gain by observing the effort invested in negotiation, a willingness to support or facilitate payment of the ransom, and the presence of money laundering services. By investing in tools and services which facilitate payment of the ransom, and its conversion to fiat currency, the attackers signal their financial motives. As the attack on the Dallas City Government shows, the financial and social impacts of ransomware attacks can be diverse and severe. High-impact ransomware attacks, such as the one which targeted Colonial Oil in May 2021 and took a major US fuel pipeline offline, are obviously dangerous to the continuity of vital services. In January 2023, there was a ransomware attack on the Royal Mail in the UK that led to the suspension of international deliveries. It took over a month for service levels to get back to normal. This attack would have had a significant direct impact on the Royal Mail’s revenue and reputation. But, perhaps more importantly, it impacted all the small businesses and people who rely on it. In May 2021, the Irish NHS was hit by a ransomware attack. This affected every aspect of patient care with widespread cancellation of appointments. The Taoiseach Micheál Martin said: “It’s a shocking attack on a health service, but fundamentally on the patients and the Irish public.” Sensitive data was also reportedly leaked. The financial impact of the attack could be as high as 100 million euros. This, however, does not account for the health and psychological impact on patients and medics affected by the disruption. As well as health services, education has also been a prime target. For instance, in January 2023 a school in Guilford, UK, suffered an attack with the criminals threatening to publish sensitive data including safeguarding reports and information about vulnerable children. Attacks are also timed to maximise disruption. For instance, an attack in June 2023 on a school in Dorchester, UK, left the school unable to use email or access services during the main exam period. This can have a profound impact on children’s wellbeing and educational achievement. These examples are by no means exhaustive. Many attacks, for instance, directly target businesses and charities that are too small to attract attention. The impact on a small business, in terms of business disruption, lost reputation and the psychological cost of facing the consequences of an attack can be devastating. As an example, a survey in 2021 found that 34% of UK businesses that suffered a ransomware attack subsequently closed down. And, many of the businesses that continued operation still had to lay off staff. The origins of ransomware are usually traced back to the AIDS or PC Cyborg Trojan virus in the 1980s. In this case, victims who inserted a floppy disk in their computer would find their files subsequently encrypted and a payment requested. Disks were distributed to attendees and people interested in specific conferences, who would then attempt to access the disk to complete a survey - instead becoming infected with the trojan. Files on affected computers were encrypted using a key stored locally on each target machine. A victim could, in principle, have restored access to their files by using this key. The victim, though, may not have known that they could do this, as even now, technical knowledge of cryptography is not common among most PC users. Eventually, law enforcement traced the floppy disks to a Harvard-taught evolutionary biologist named Joseph Popp, who was conducting AIDS research at the time. He was arrested and charged with multiple counts of blackmail, and has been credited by some with being the inventor of ransomware. No one knows exactly what provoked Popp to do what he did. Many early versions of ransomware were quite basic cryptographic systems which suffered from various issues surrounding how easy it was to find the key information the criminal was trying to hide from the victim. This is one reason why ransomware really came of age with the CryptoLocker attack in 2013 and 2014. CryptoLocker was the first technically sound ransomware attack virus to be distributed en masse. Thousands of victims saw their files encrypted by ransomware that could not be reverse engineered. The private keys, used in encryption, were held by the attacker and victims could not restore access to their files without them. Ransoms of around US$300-600 were demanded and it is estimated the criminals got away with around US$3 million. Cryptolocker was eventually shut down in 2014 following an operation involving multiple, international law enforcement agencies. CryptoLocker was pivotal in showing proof of concept that criminals could earn large amounts of money from ransomware. Subsequently, there was an explosion of new variants and new types. There was also significant evolution in the strategies used by criminals. One important development was the emergence of ransomware-as-a-service. This is a term for markets on the dark web through which criminals can obtain and use “off-the-shelf” ransomware without the need for advanced computing skills while the ransomware providers take a cut of the profits. Research has shown how the dark web is the “unregulated Wild West of the internet” and a safe haven for criminals to communicate and exchange of illegal goods and services. It is easily accessible and with the help of anonymisation technology and digital currencies, there is a global black economy thriving there. An estimated US$1 billion was spent there during the first nine months of 2019 alone, according to the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement. With ransomware as a service (Raas) the barrier to entry for aspiring cyber criminals, in terms of both cost and skill, was lowered. Under the Raas model, expertise is provided by vendors who develop the malware while the attackers themselves may be relatively unskilled. This also has the effect of compartmentalising risk – the arrest of cyber criminals using ransomware no longer threatens the entire supply chain, allowing attacks launched by other groups to continue. We have also seen a movement away from mass phishing attacks, like CryptoLocker, which reached more than 250,000 systems, to more targeted attacks. That has meant an increasing focus on organisations with the revenue to pay large ransoms. Multinational organisations, legal firms, schools, universities, hospitals and healthcare providers have all become prime targets, as well as many small and micro businesses and charities. A more recent development in ransomware, such as Netwalker, REvil/Sodinokibi, has been the threat of double extortion. This is where the criminals not only encrypt files but also exfiltrate data by copying the files. They then have the potential to leak or post potentially sensitive and important information. An example of this occurred in 2020, when one of the largest software companies, Software AG, was hit with a double extortion ransomware called Clop. It was reported that the attackers had requested an exceptionally high ransom payment of US$20 million (about £15.7 million) which Software AG refused to pay. This led to attackers releasing confidential company data on the dark web. This provides criminals with two sources of leverage: they can ransom for the private key to decrypt files and they can ransom to stop publication of sensitive data.   Double extortion changes the business model of ransomware in interesting ways. In particular, with standard ransomware, there is a relatively straightforward incentive for a victim to pay a ransom for access to the private key if that would allow decryption of the files, and they cannot access the files through any other means. The victim “only” needs to trust the cyber criminal will give them the key and that the key will work. But with data exfiltration, by contrast, it is not obvious what the victim gets in return for paying the ransom. The criminals still have the sensitive data and could still publish it any time they want. They could, indeed, ask for subsequent ransoms to not publish the files. Therefore, for data exfiltration to be a viable business strategy the criminals need to build a credible reputation of “honouring” ransom payments. This has arguably led to a normalised ransomware ecosystem. For instance, ransom negotiators are private contractors and in some cases are required as part of a cyber insurance agreement to provide expertise in the managing of crisis situations involving ransomware. Where instructed, they will facilitate negotiated ransom payments. Within this ecosystem, some ransomware criminal gangs have developed a reputation for not publishing data (or at least delaying publication) if a ransom is paid. More generally, the encryption, decryption or exfiltration of files is typically a difficult and costly task for criminals to pull off. It is far simpler to delete the files and then claim they have been encrypted or exfiltrated and demand a ransom. However, if the victims suspect that they won’t be getting the decryption key or encrypted data back then they won’t pay the ransom. And those that do pay a ransom and get nothing in return may disclose that fact. This is likely to impact the attacker’s “reputation” and the likelihood of future ransom payments. Simply put, it pays to play “fair” in the world of extortion and ransom attacks. So in less than ten years we have seen the ransomware threat evolve enormously from the relatively low scale CryptoLocker, to a multi-million dollar business involving organised criminal gangs and sophisticated strategies. From 2020 onwards the incidents of ransomware, and consequent losses, have seemingly increased by another order of magnitude. Ransomware has become too big to ignore and is now a major concern for governments and law enforcement. Devastating though ransomware has become, the threat will inevitably evolve further, as criminals develop new techniques for extortion. As mentioned already, a key theme in our collective research over the last ten years has been to try and preempt the likely strategies that criminals can employ so as to be ahead of the game. Our research is now focused on the next generation of ransomware, which we believe will include variants focused on cryptocurrency, and the “consensus mechanisms” used within them. A consensus mechanism is any method (usually algorithmic) used to achieve agreement, trust and security across a decentralised computer network. Specifically, cryptocurrencies are increasingly using a so called “proof-of-stake” consensus mechanism, in which investors stake significant sums of currency, to validate crypto transactions. These stakes are vulnerable to extortion by ransomware criminals. Cryptocurrencies rely on a decentralised blockchain that provides a transparent record of all the transactions that have taken place using that currency. The blockchain is maintained by a peer-to-peer network rather than a central authority (as with conventional currency). In principle, the transaction records included in the blockchain are immutable, verifiable and securely distributed across the network, giving users full ownership and visibility into the transaction data. These properties of blockchain rely on a secure and non-manipulable “consensus mechanism” in which the independent nodes in the network “approve” or “agree” which transactions to add to the blockchain. Until now, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have relied on a so-called “proof-of-work” consensus mechanism in which the authorisation of transactions involves the solving of complex mathematical problems (the work). In the long term this approach is unsustainable because it results in duplication of effort and avoidable large scale energy use. The alternative, which is now becoming a reality, is a “proof-of-stake” consensus mechanism. Here, transactions are approved by validators who have staked money and are financially rewarded for validating transactions. The role of inefficient work is replaced by a financial stake. While this addresses the energy problem, it means that large amounts of staked money becomes involved in validating crypto-transactions. The existence of this staked money provides a novel threat to some proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies. We have focussed our attention on Ethereum, a decentralised cryptocurrency that establishes a peer-to-peer network to securely execute and verify application code, known as a smart contract. Ethereum is powered by the Ether (ETH) token that allows users to transact with each other through the use of these smart contracts. The Ethereum project was co-founded by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 to overcome shortcomings with Bitcoin. On September 15 2022, The Merge, moved the Ethereum network from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, making it one of the first prominent proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies. The proof-of-stake consensus mechanism in Ethereum relies on “validators” to approve transactions. To set up a validator there needs to be a minimum stake of 32ETH, which is currently around US$60,000 (around £43,000). Validators can then earn a financial return on their stake from operating a validator in accordance with Ethereum rules. At the time of writing there are around 850,000 validators. A lot of hope is being pinned on the “stake” solution of validation - but hackers are sure to be looking into how they can infiltrate the system. In our project, which was funded by the Ethereum Foundation, we identified ways in which ransomware groups could exploit the new proof-of-stake mechanism for extortion. We found that attackers could exploit validators through a process called “slashing”. While validators receive rewards for obeying the rules, there are financial penalties for validators that are seen to act maliciously. The basic objective of penalties is to prevent exploitation of the decentralised blockchain. There are two forms of penalties, the most severe of which is slashing. Slashing occurs for actions that should not happen by accident and could jeopardise the blockchain, such as proposing conflicting blocks are added to the blockchain, or trying to change history. Slashing penalties are relatively severe with the validator losing a significant share of their stake, at least 1ETH. Indeed, in the most extreme case the validator could lose all of their stake (32ETH). The validator will also be forced to exit and no longer act as a validator. In short, if a validator is slashed there are big financial consequences. To perform actions, validators are assigned unique signing keys, that, in essence, prove who they are to the network. Suppose that a criminal got hold of the signing key? Then, they could blackmail the victim into paying a ransom. Flow diagram showing just how complicated it gets when there is an extortion attack against proof-of-stake validators, such as Ethereum The victim may be reluctant to pay the ransom unless there is a guarantee that the criminals will not take their money and fail to return/release the key. After all, what is to stop the criminals asking for another ransom? One solution we have found – which harks back to the fact that ransomware has in fact become a kind of business operated by criminals who want prove they have an “honest” reputation – is a smart contract. This automated contract can be written so that the process only works if both sides “honour” their side of the bargain. So, the victim could pay the ransom and be confident that this will resolve the direct extortion threat. This is possible through the Ethereum because all the steps required are publicly observable on the blockchain – the deposit, the sign to exit, the absence of slashing, and the return of the stake. Functionally, these smart contracts are an escrow system in which money may be held until pre-agreed conditions are met. For instance, if the criminals force slashing before the validator has fully exited, then the contract will ensure that the ransom amount is returned to the victim. Such contracts are, however, open to abuse, and there’s no guarantee that an attacker-authored contract can be trusted. There is potential for the contract to be automated in a fully trusted way, but we have yet to observe such behaviour and systems emerge. This type of “pay and exit” strategy is an effective way for criminals to extort victims if they can obtain the validator signing keys. So how much damage would a ransomware attack like this do to Ethereum? If a single validator is compromised then the slashing penalty – and so maximum ransom demand – would be in the region of 1ETH, which is around US$1,800 (about £1,400). To leverage larger amounts of money the criminals, therefore, need to target organisations or staking pools that are responsible for managing large numbers of validators. Remember, that given the high entry costs for individual investors, most of the validating on Ethereum will be run under “staking pools” in which multiple investors can collectively stake money. To put this in perspective, Lido is the largest staking pool in Ethereum with around 127,000 validators and 18% of the total stake; Coinbase is the second largest with 40,000 validators and 6% of the total stake. In total, there are 21 staking pools operating more than a 1,000 validators. Any one of these staking pools is responsible for tens of millions of dollars of stake and so viable ransom demands could also be in the millions of dollars. Proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms are too young for us to know whether extortion of staking pools will become an active reality. But the general lesson of ransomware’s evolution is that the criminals tend to gravitate towards strategies that incentivise payment and increase their illicit gains. The most straightforward way that investors and staking pool operators can mitigate the extortion threat we have identified is by protecting their signing keys. If the criminals cannot access the signing keys then there is no threat. If the criminals can only access some of the keys (for operators with multiple validators) then the threat may fail to be lucrative. So staking pools need to take measures to secure signing keys. This would involve a range of actions including: partitioning validators so that a breach only impacts a small subset; step up cyber security to prevent intrusion, and robust internal processes to limit the insider threat of an employee divulging signing keys. The staking pool market for cryptocurrencies like Ethereum is competitive. There are many staking pools, all offering relatively similar services, and competing on price to attract investors. These competitive forces, and the need to cut costs, may lead to relatively lax security measures. Some staking pools may, therefore, prove a relatively easy target for criminals. Ultimately, this can only be solved with regulation, greater awareness and for investors in staking pools to demand high levels of security to protect their stake. Unfortunately, the history of ransomware suggests that high profile attacks will need to be seen before the threat is taken seriously enough. It is interesting to contemplate the consequences of a significant breach of a staking pool. The reputation of the staking pool would presumably be badly affected and so the staking pool’s viability in a competitive market is questionable. An attack may also have implications for the reputation of the currency. At the most serious, it could lead to a currency collapsing. When that happens - as it did with FTX in 2022 following another hacking attack, there are knock-on effects to the global economy. Ransomware will be a challenge for years, if not decades, to come. One potential vision of the future is that ransomware just becomes part of normal economic life with organisations facing the constant threat of attack, with few consequences for the largely anonymous gangs of cyber criminals behind the scams. To preempt such negative consequences we need greater awareness of the threat. Then investors can make more informed decisions over which staking pools and currencies to invest in. It also makes sense to have a market with many staking pools, rather than a market dominated by just a few large ones, as this could insulate the currency from possible attacks. Beyond crypto, preemption involves investment in cyber security across a range of forms – from staff training and an organisational culture that supports reporting of incidents. It also involves investment in recovery options, such as effective back-ups, in-house expertise, insurance and tried and tested contingency plans. Unfortunately, cyber security practices are not improving as one might hope in many organisations and this is leaving the door open for cyber criminals. Essentially, everyone needs to get better at hiding, and protecting, their digital keys and sensitive information if we are to stand a chance against the next generation of ransomware attackers.

U.S. crypto-related stocks looked set to start the week on a positive note after bitcoin (BTC) climbed through $72,000 for the first time since mid-March as its reward halving draws closer. Coinbase (COIN), the only U.S. traded crypto exchange, gained 4.9% in pre-market trading, MicroStrategy (MSTR), the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, rose 10% and BlackRock’s bitcoin exchange-traded fund (IBIT), added around 6.5%. Bitcoin advanced 4.4% over 24 hours while the CoinDesk 20 Index, a measure of the broader crypto market, rose 4.1%. Other tokens rising on Monday included meme coins dogwifhat, which gained 18%, and pepe, which rose 10%. According to trader Michaël van de Poppe, there is still a lot of momentum to be gained for altcoins as bitcoin dominance continues to peak pre-halving. “They [altcoins] are super undervalued,” van de Poppe said in a post on X. Bitcoin could soon rally to new record highs after breaking through a so-called triangle resistance, according to technical analysis by 10x Research. On its way to $72,000, BTC passed through a triangular consolidation pattern identified by a resistance line connecting March 15 and March 27 highs and a support line connecting March 20 and April 3 lows. "If the breakout is bullish, which we suspect, bitcoin could climb above 80,000 during the next few weeks – if not earlier. Buying at $69,280 and setting a stop loss at $65,000 appears appropriate," Markus Thielen, founder of 10X Research, said in a note sent to clients early Monday. BlackRock (BLK) added five authorized participants (APs) to the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), bringing the total number to nine as the exchange-traded fund continues to attract billions of dollars from investors. The new APs include Wall Street banking giants Goldman Sachs, Citadel Securities, Citigroup and UBS alongside clearing house ABN AMRO, according to a prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). They join Jane Street Capital, JPMorgan, Masquarie and Virtu Americas. CoinDesk reported in January that Goldman Sachs was looking to play a key role for the bitcoin ETFs and was in talks with issuers about becoming an AP.

221::https://beincrypto.com/managing-global-teams-performance-focus-goal-alignment/::BeInCrypto::article::Time Spent at Desk Is Unimportant: Managing Global Teams with Performance Focus and Goal Alignment::The art of managing a diverse and distributed global team is an essential skill and a critical element of organizational success.::We use cookies to improve your experience. The art of managing a diverse and distributed global team is an essential skill and a critical element of organizational success. The antiquated notion that productivity can be measured by the time spent hunched over a desk is fading rapidly. Instead, a new paradigm has emerged, focusing on performance, clear goals, and expectations. This innovative approach values output over input, achievement over effort, and results over time. This shift in perspective brings with it a need for robust and meaningful metrics – Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). KPIs serve as a compass, guiding organizations toward their goals while revealing areas for improvement. However, all KPIs are not created equal, and identifying the right ones can make the difference between thriving and just surviving. Communication, both verbal and non-verbal, is the cornerstone of any team. Its importance is magnified in remote work environments. Let’s break down why: Are you looking for promising web3 talent? With the right approach, remote work can actually strengthen team relationships rather than dilute them. Here’s how you can enhance team bonding: By focusing on these areas, you can create an environment where employees feel connected, valued, and motivated to contribute their best work, irrespective of geographical boundaries. As we embrace remote work, we must always focus on fostering a performance-oriented and goal-aligned culture over counting hours at a desk. Embracing a culture of constructive feedback is akin to committing to continuous improvement. A culture that values feedback is one where employees feel valued, heard, and encouraged to grow. The feedback process should ideally look and feel like this: Meritocracy and transparency are the linchpins of a high-performing global team. When employees see that hard work, competence, and performance are consistently rewarded, it fosters a sense of fairness, motivation, and productivity. While monitoring progress and providing guidance is important, micromanaging can stifle initiative and erode trust. Here are a few strategies to avoid micromanagement while still maintaining effective oversight: Collaboration and project management tools are the lifeblood of remote and global teams. They foster a digital workspace that transcends geographical boundaries and time zones, enabling effective teamwork and communication. Data analytics for performance tracking Using data analytics to track performance is crucial in managing global teams, as it provides quantitative insights into individual and team productivity. Time tracking: For roles where tracking time spent on tasks is relevant, tools like Toggl and Harvest can be instrumental. They can provide insights into work patterns and help identify areas for efficiency improvement. Looking for a job in web3?

This follows recent reports from Axios indicating a delay in Andreessen’s upcoming crypto investment initiatives to 2025. Both rounds centered on blockchain infrastructure ventures. A16z led a $4.2 million seed round for Pimlico, an infrastructure product working to let wallet developers abstract away parts of the payment process. In a blog post announcing the raise, a16z general partner Sriram Krishnan said Pimlico CEO Kristof Gazso participated in the venture firm’s crypto startup school in Los Angeles. “By the end of Crypto Startup School, we were convinced that no one was better equipped to build the supporting infrastructure for account abstraction than Kristof,” Krishnan wrote. The use of Pimlico’s form of account abstraction has increased for four straight months, according to data from 1confirmation general partner Richard Chen. A16z also participated in a $5.5 million seed round for the developer tool Stackr. Stackr built a software development kit (SDK) to let developers build Web3 apps using general-programming languages — starting with JavaScript. Stackr lets developers create “micro-rollups,” the platform’s term for rollups that separate execution and proving. This design prioritizes ease of development over decentralization, adapting rollup technology to better suit developers’ needs. The Stackr investment came from a16z’s 2023 crypto startup school. These two investments mark a16z crypto’s return to backing blockchain infrastructure startups. Their last similar move was in LayerZero’s $120 million round in April, according to CryptoRank. Meanwhile, Lightspeed Faction announced its $285 million crypto venture fund this week, telling Blockworks that Faction is primarily interested in infrastructure and protocol level projects. A16z did not return a request for comment. Other notable recent ventures from the megafund include a restaurant rewards app and a Web3 gaming studio. Read more: A16z eyes $3.4B raise for next venture funds: Axios The decentralized AI project Ritual secured $25 million in seed funding, Blockworks previously reported. The round was led by Archetype with participation from Accomplice and Robot Ventures. In a blog post announcing the fundraise and the company, Ritual highlighted that the crypto space is already working to address key challenges for AI startups, such as centralized APIs, closed-source code and high computational costs. Ritual hopes to launch its platform in early 2024 with a focus on letting AI preserve transparency and privacy. The project is advised by the founders of NEAR Protocol and Eigenlayer. Ritual’s raise comes the same week as OpenAI’s DevDay conference and shortly after X debuted its own chatbot, Grok.

Chairman Patrick McHenry recently announced that on September 20th the committee will be discussing two bills specifically related to the concept of a dollar. These discussions, referred to as markups will involve lawmakers and regulators fine tuning the details of the bills before they are voted upon on the House floor. One of these bills, known as H.R. 3712 or the Digital Dollar Pilot Prevention Act aims to limit the Federal Reserves authority in initiating trial programs for a currency without obtaining approval, from Congress. This bill was introduced by Representative Alex Mooney back in May. While it is important to note that the Federal Reserve has not made a decision regarding issuing a dollar and acknowledges that legislative approval would be necessary if pursued there have been indications from the San Francisco Federal Reserves pursuit of technology experts for a digital currency project that this idea is still being considered. The second bill intends to amend the Federal Reserve Act in order to prevent Federal Reserve banks from providing services to individuals. Additionally this bill seeks limitations on how a digital dollar could be utilized in areas such, as influencing policy. According to the rule Federal Reserve banks are prohibited from offering a bank currency (CBDC) directly to individuals even if it is done through third party financial institutions. The concept of a dollar has sparked discussions, in the United States. Prominent personalities like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. And Ron DeSantis have expressed concerns suggesting that a digital currency might pose risks, to both the nations system and individual financial privacy. However there are also individuals who support this idea arguing that it could help maintain the influence of the U.S. Dollar and promote adoption of cryptocurrencies. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

Share this article Mastercard and Standard Chartered Bank Hong Kong (SCBHK) have successfully completed the first live test of Mastercard’s Multi-Token Network (MTN) within the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) Fintech Supervisory Sandbox. The proof-of-concept pilot involved tokenizing carbon credits and performing an atomic swap between the tokenized deposit and carbon credit. According to Helena Chen, Mastercard’s managing director for HK & Macau, the project will “reshape how consumers and businesses connect, interact, and transact.” The pilot project was initiated when a client of SCBHK’s virtual bank, Mox Bank, requested to purchase a carbon credit using deposited funds. Mox then requested SCBHK to tokenize the carbon credit through Libeara, a tokenization service provider launched by Standard Chartered’s venture arm, SC Ventures. “The tokenization of real-world assets and the potential use of different forms of tokenized currency is integral to the future of the financial industry,” shares Mary Huen, CEO of Standard Chartered Hong Kong. Mastercard’s MTN facilitated the tokenization of the deposit, enabling the real-time swap across different blockchains. Mastercard launched the MTN on its private blockchain in June last year. Prior to this live test, the network had undergone trial runs in collaboration with the Reserve Bank of Australia using wrapped central bank digital currency (CBDC) and the HKMA using its e-HKD CBDC, although neither of these CBDCs is currently live. The HKMA has been actively promoting Hong Kong as a leading digital assets hub, reportedly pressuring local banks, including SCBHK, to improve their services for crypto exchanges. SCBHK is involved in several HKMA initiatives, such as Project Ensemble, the e-HKD pilot program, and the multinational Project mBridge. In November, HSBC bank and China’s Ant Group also tested tokenized deposit transactions using Ant Group’s blockchain within an HKMA sandbox, while HSBC offers Bitcoin and Ethereum futures exchange-traded fund trading in Hong Kong.

225::https://theconversation.com/bitcoin-the-uk-and-us-are-clamping-down-on-crypto-trading-heres-why-its-not-yet-a-big-deal-147775::The Conversation::article::Bitcoin: the UK and US are clamping down on crypto trading – here’s why it’s not yet a big deal::In quick succession, UK has banned certain crypto derivatives trading and the owners of leading exchange BitMex have been indicted on criminal charges.::The sale and promotion of derivatives of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to amateur investors is being banned in the UK by the financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). It is a further blow to the burgeoning cryptocurrency market, coming days after the US authorities indicted the owners of leading crypto derivatives exchange BitMex for operating without being US-registered and allegedly failing to follow anti-money-laundering rules. In view of recent findings from the University of Cambridge that most firms involved in crypto investments are still operating without a licence, other operators are potentially vulnerable to indictments too. It all sounds like bad news for anyone hoping that more investors will put money into cryptocurrencies. But on a closer inspection, I’m not so sure. The FCA is preventing retail investors from buying and selling the likes of cryptocurrency futures and options, which people often use as a way of hedging their bets on an underlying asset. For example, you might buy an option to sell a certain number of bitcoin at today’s price if the price falls by 10%, giving you an insurance policy in case the market moves against you. The FCA said it was introducing the ban from January 6 because amateur investors were at risk of “sudden and unexpected losses”. The reasoning is that these people often don’t understand the market, there is lots of “market abuse and financial crime” in the sector, cryptocurrencies are very volatile and they are hard to value. To stress, the ban is not being extended to professional traders or institutional firms like hedge funds, which have typically been allowed access to riskier financial products than the general population. It is about protecting people who might have been drawn to bitcoin thinking “it may be the currency of the future”, having “heard sensational news coverage about the rise and fall”. There are any number of splashy trading sites offering them quick and easy entry into this world, and YouTube influencers who enthusiastically encourage them to try complex trading. Some 1.9 million people – around 4% of the adult population – own cryptocurrencies in the UK. Three-quarters have holdings worth less than £1,000 and would certainly qualify as retail investors. We don’t know what proportion of UK investors use crypto derivatives, but we do know that the worldwide trade in these financial products was nearly a fifth of the total crypto market in 2019 (and has been growing rapidly in 2020). Yet retail investors are probably not the main users of derivatives. Trading site eToro said earlier this year that maybe only a tenth of their retail investor spend was on this segment. And with most of the UK contingent using non-UK based exchanges, it’s easy enough to avoid FCA jurisdiction. The FCA says the ban could reduce annual losses and fees to investors by between £19 million and £101 million. The ban also doesn’t make much difference at a worldwide level. The UK crypto market is small beer compared to global cryptocurrency holdings, which are worth US$335 billion (£258 billion). You would not therefore have expected the FCA ban to have a material detrimental impact on the price of bitcoin or leading alternative coins like ethereum, and sure enough, it didn’t. In fact, it was widely expected by industry observers and had arguably already been priced in. The fact that the price of bitcoin is very volatile has historically been the scourge of this sector, with many specialists repeatedly saying that this prevents it from serving as a store of value and becoming a functional currency. You could argue that banning some derivatives trading has the potential to reduce this volatility. When people buy derivatives, they can be highly levered, meaning that they are borrowing to increase the size of their trade to make greater potential gains (or losses). Many exchanges, typically in Asia, allow investors to borrow 15 times the size of the trade, while some offer over 100 times leverage. When trades are leveraged, investors enter and exit the market more quickly, since their loss or gain is multiplied by the proportion they have borrowed. It’s this effect on the market that increases price volatility. Yet bitcoin has lately been trading at an all-time low for volatility, so the ban may not achieve much in this respect. None of this is to say that the ban is meaningless. Derivatives make markets more efficient by allowing investors to hedge their bets, so even a partial ban in one major country has to be seen as a step backwards for cryptocurrencies. There is also a bigger danger for the industry that other leading global financial regulators such as the SEC in the US and BaFin in Germany may follow suit. This damage could be greatly aggravated if the US or other authorities were to indict other unregistered exchanges like BitMex. That could cause a liquidity crisis as investors withdrew their money en masse. Again, we will have to wait and see what happens. BitMex has said that around 30% of customer funds have been withdrawn since the US issued charges, but insists it is open for “business as usual”. But as far as the UK ban is concerned, I would argue on balance that curtailing excessive risk-taking by amateur traders in a sector where trading vanilla cryptocurrencies is risky enough seems logical. I have met many “retail investors” in crypto whose depth of knowledge is refreshing, far exceeding that of financial institutions, but there will certainly be others who don’t understand their risks. To end on a positive note, part of the FCA’s reasoning for the ban was that there was “no reliable basis” for valuing cryptocurrencies. It did not say there was no value in cryptocurrencies. That is a noticeable shift from what regulators might have said in the past, and is a sign that bitcoin is becoming more widely accepted.::2020-10-09T13:56:25Z::Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, Derivatives, Financial Conduct Authority, financial trading::Gavin Brown::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/362649/original/file-20201009-19-1qzu5ko.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=44%2C145%2C2899%2C1449&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
226::https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/05/14/the-hard-truths-and-worrying-consequences-of-the-tornado-cash-verdict/::CoinDesk::article::The Hard Truths and Worrying Consequences of the Tornado Cash Verdict::Developer Alexey Pertsev was sentenced today to 64 months in prison. His prosecution makes sense from a law enforcement point of view, even if the implications are horrible for anyone creating a product that could be used for unforeseen uses.::There are hard truths in life, and then there are the things we want to believe. The sentencing of Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev to 64 months in prison in the Netherlands shows how these two things are often at odds. On both sides of the debate over the sanctioned crypto mixer, there are bad arguments and even worse conclusions. Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates. This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here. First, it was always painfully obvious that the now sanctioned crypto mixer Tornado Cash was designed to shield people’s identities, thereby facilitating crime. If it wasn’t, then it wouldn’t be very useful for protecting people like peace activists or political dissidents who need privacy – like Vitalik Buterin sending funds to Ukraine activists with a pitstop through Tornado Cash. Moreover, it was always the case that jostling together funds from a variety of sources, licit and illicit, was likely to be construed as a form of money laundering. Sure, Tornado Cash’s developers never took custody of the funds and therefore never directly, personally facilitated money laundering, but they did build an unstoppable smart contract without any of the types of controls that money transmitters are usually subject to like collecting and verifying identifying information from users to aid investigations. That was essentially the argument of the Dutch prosecutors who tried Pertsev: that the 31-year-old Russian national living in the Netherlands, and his colleagues Roman Storm and Roman Semenov (who face similar charges in the U.S.), made a series of choices about how to design, upkeep and market their mixer. See also: Tornado Cash Devs Are Caught in a U.S. Dragnet | Opinion “The decision of the Dutch courts to condemn and impose a heavy prison sentence on Alexey Pertsev seems unjust and disproportionate, given the novelty of the technology and the numerous legitimate uses of Tornado Cash,” crypto lawyer Fatemeh Fannizadeh told CoinDesk. “The decentralized, disintermediated, and censorship-resistant nature of blockchain does not align perfectly with traditional patterns of regulated behavior and should therefore be treated with a more nuanced legal approach.” Indeed, part of Pertsev’s defense was acknowledging that, even if money laundering was happening, because the protocol operated like a robot on a blockchain and users always maintained "exclusive control” over their funds, if anyone is to blame it is the users themselves. This is to say nothing that Tornado’s devs did maintain a frontend, through which 90+% of users went through. This has somewhat dangerous implications. As money blogger J.P. Koning points out, if people could simply absolve themselves of the responsibility of building and deploying a machine they know could and likely would be used by criminals, then “anyone who wants to facilitate illegal activities would have a strong incentive to copy Tornado Cash.” “In a world in which the Tornado Cash defense prevails and payments companies adopt it as a techno-legal shield against money laundering charges,” attempts to stymie crime become less effective, “and not because we decided to soften them via a democratic process, but because financial institutions found sneaky ways to get around the rules,” he continued. See also: Cloning Tornado Cash Would Be Easy, but Risky | Opinion Still, at the same time, there are many worrying aspects of the case against Pertsev. Perhaps most significantly was the judge’s ruling from the bench that there was “no legitimate use” of Tornado Cash – as if privacy itself is a crime. Even though there were many legitimate uses of anonymizing one’s blockchain history, according to authorities every dollar that passed through was suspect. Then there is the stultifying conclusion that, apparently, developers are somehow responsible for how people use their programs. This is not just a fundamental misunderstanding of how immutable smart contract protocols work, but there is seemingly no end to the liability this could cause for anyone who builds anything, and not just software. Are gun manufacturers held liable for shootings? Is the U.S. government responsible if physical cash is used for crime? The double standard in Pertsev’s case is troubling. As the DeFi Education Fund put it in an amicus brief: “With no limiting principle in place, nearly all developers who create open-source software would be exposed to criminal liability for activity outside of their control years or decades later.” Does this mean governments will actually begin to pursue cases against disadvantaged developers, perhaps working in politically unfavorable industries? That remains to be seen. But whether or not you agree with the interpretation of the law, the hard truth here is that mixers aren’t just about privacy and human rights – and to the extent that they facilitate crime, authorities will want to shut them down.

227::https://beincrypto.com/cool-team-building-activities-for-remote-teams/::BeInCrypto::article::Building Bonds Across Screens: 5 Cool Team-Building Activities for Remote Teams::Tteam building activities for remote teams are no longer a 'nice to have'; they are necessary to foster unity and improve communication.::We use cookies to improve your experience. In the past decade, the traditional concept of work has dramatically shifted. An evolving digital landscape coupled with global events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, has forced businesses to redefine the conventional workspace, leading to the rise of remote teams. As an expert with two decades of experience in human resources and digital technology, I’ve While the rise of remote working is undeniable, so are the teething problems that come with it. One of the most prominent challenges is team-building in remote work settings. Remote work often gets applauded for its flexibility, increased productivity, and the ability to draw talent globally. But it also has its unique set of challenges. The most notable among them is the difficulty of building a cohesive, collaborative team when screens and possibly thousands of miles separate members. The absence of face-to-face interactions, water cooler chats, and traditional team-building activities can often lead to disconnect and isolation. That’s where the significance of team-building activities for remote teams comes into the picture. These activities are no longer a ‘nice to have’; they are necessary to foster unity and improve communication among team members. Why is team-building in a remote work setting important? Now that we know why, let’s learn more about how. Creating moments for informal conversation is key to fostering a close-knit remote team. That’s where virtual coffee sessions and lunch breaks come into play. Who says meetings have to be strictly business? Here’s how a “Meeting About Nothing” can turn into something beautiful for your remote team: We all have an indeed child that wants to come out and play. Here’s how: Online multiplayer games are a brilliant way to engage team members and promote healthy competition. Here are a few recommendations: Diversity and cultural appreciation can significantly enhance team dynamics in a remote setup. The GeoGuesser game offers an innovative way to explore this: To add a layer of learning, consider incorporating a post-game discussion where team members share unique facts about the locations they landed in. This discussion could create a platform for team members from diverse cultures to share more about their traditions, fostering better cultural understanding. Are you looking for promising web3 talent? Traditional board games like Taboo can also transition seamlessly into the virtual world. Here’s how you can use Taboo to promote teamwork: Sitting in front of a laptop for the most significant part of your day is not really the best thing for your physical well-being. Remote work has its perks, but it does come with its downsides. Here are some creative ways to enable and empower people to live healthier lives. The key to successful remote team-building activities is engagement and participation. Promoting a Daily Gym Photo Contest is not an opportunity to flex muscles but more of an encouragement for team members to be active. A virtual running challenge can significantly boost team morale and physical well-being in the spirit of friendly competition. Humour is a universal language. It’s the antidote to stress, overworking and negativity, and it can play a massive role in bringing people in remote settings together. Here’s how. GIF battles and meme contests are not just frivolous distractions. They can serve as powerful team-building exercises. Here’s how: Finding or creating the perfect GIF or meme that resonates with the rest of the team demands high creativity. It allows team members to exercise their creative muscles, which can subsequently translate to their everyday tasks. A healthy dose of humour can work wonders for team morale. Laughter helps diffuse tension, alleviate stress, and foster an environment of positivity, which can significantly improve productivity. These contests provide a platform for team members to interact and engage with one another outside the context of work. They get to appreciate each other’s humour and creativity, strengthening the bonds within the team. To make these battles more interesting, consider implementing theme rounds using platforms like Giphy.com or Google Images. The pathway to a more bonded remote team can also be paved with activities that promote mental wellness and continuous learning. Here are some suggestions: In conclusion, team-building activities are not just for fun; they are vital to the remote work puzzle. The power of team-building in remote settings cannot be overstated. It not only promotes better communication and understanding, but it also helps to build a sense of belonging and unity. These bonds, formed across screens, often translate into higher productivity, improved collaboration, and a more robust and harmonious work environment. Looking for a job in web3?

228::https://blockworks.co/news/jpmorgan-blockchain-payments::Blockworks::article::JPMorgan adds ‘holy grail’ payments feature as part of blockchain push::JPMorgan is giving institutional clients more control over payments via JPM Coin — marking the company’s latest blockchain-related milestone.::Siemens the first to use the new offering built to allow “a real-time and a programmable treasury” JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon | Steve Jurvetson/"Jamie Dimon" (CC license) JPMorgan is giving institutional clients more control over payments via JPM Coin — marking the company’s latest blockchain-related milestone. Its new programmable payments offering is a feature for blockchain-based accounts on the JPM Coin System, a permissioned payment rail and deposit account ledger letting clients transfer dollars within the system. Programmability lets clients place rules for funding a bank account, for example — or set parameters for executing payments based on margin calls, asset delivery or meeting contract requirements. “Blockchain technology is the ideal infrastructure to which programmable payments can be applied as it enables rules and bank accounts to be integrated in a native manner, enabling cases including dynamic direct debits and multi-party escrow accounts,” a spokesperson told Blockworks in an email. JPMorgan’s Onyx Digital Assets network — launched in 2020 — enables the tokenization of traditional assets, such as US Treasurys and money-market products. The company tested programmable payments with German automation company Siemens in December 2021, calling it “a move that will forever redefine the role of corporate treasuries,” in a blog post at the time. Siemens made its first payment with the programmable capability on Nov. 6. “Advantages and features from the crypto world are now available for fiat currencies by JP Morgan’s provision of 24 [hours] by 7 [days] blockchain-based bank accounts, combined with programmability,” Siemens’ group treasurer Peter Rathgeb said in a Friday statement. Naveen Mallela, head of coin systems at Onyx, noted in a LinkedIn post that there is now “general availability” for the new offering, adding that programmability “has always been the holy grail” in the JPM Coin roadmap. “We believe that this capability will enable not only a real-time and a programmable treasury but also newer digital business models,” Mallela wrote. JPMorgan has been busy on the blockchain front. The financial titan used the Polygon blockchain to trade tokenized cash deposits in November 2022. More recently, asset manager BlackRock last month used JPMorgan’s Tokenized Collateral Network to tokenize shares in one of its money market funds. It then sent those interests to Barclays as collateral for an over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives trade between the firms.

229::https://coinatory.com/cryptocurrency-news/swiss-bitcoin-advocates-revive-campaign-for-btc-inclusion-in-national-bank-reserves-18550/::Coinatory::article::Swiss Bitcoin Advocates Revive Campaign for BTC Inclusion in National Bank Reserves::Discover the renewed efforts by Swiss Bitcoin advocates to include Bitcoin in the Swiss National Bank's reserves, featuring a strategic constitutional referendum and high-profile support.::In a strategic revival of efforts to bolster Switzerland’s financial independence, a cohort of Swiss Bitcoin advocates, led by Yves Bennaïm of the non-profit think tank 2B4CH, has initiated a renewed campaign. This movement aims to persuade the Swiss National Bank to adopt Bitcoin (BTC) into its reserves via a constitutional referendum, citing the enhancement of Switzerland’s sovereignty and neutrality amid rising global instability. Yves Bennaïm, while addressing Neue Zürcher Zeitung on April 20, disclosed the final stages of preparations, which include the organizational setup and drafting of the necessary documents. These documents are slated for submission to the State Chancellery, marking the commencement of the referendum process. The campaign must gather 100,000 signatures from Swiss citizens within an 18-month window to meet the referendum’s criteria, a challenge that previously stymied their initial efforts in October 2021. The advocates aim to embed Bitcoin as a reserve currency within Article 99-3 of the Swiss Federal Constitution. With Switzerland’s population at 8.77 million, this signifies that approximately 1.15% of the populace needs to endorse the petition for it to proceed. Luzius Meisser, head of the Bitcoin-centric trading platform Bitcoin Suisse and a collaborator with Bennaïm, argues that incorporating Bitcoin would underscore Switzerland’s financial autonomy from the European Central Bank and fortify its stance of neutrality. Meisser is scheduled to present the benefits of this inclusion to the Swiss National Bank on April 26, where he will be granted three minutes to present his case. His earlier proposition in March 2022, which suggested the bank should purchase $1.1 billion in Bitcoin monthly instead of German government bonds, was rebuffed by Thomas Jordan, Chair of the Swiss National Bank. Jordan remarked in April 2022 that Bitcoin did not satisfy the criteria necessary for a reserve currency. However, Meisser contends that had the bank adopted his recommendation, it would now benefit from an additional $32.9 billion. He also warned that delays could lead to escalated acquisition costs, as other central banks might initiate Bitcoin purchases. The initiative garners further optimism with recent developments like the approval of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds in the U.S. and Hong Kong, as noted by Leon Curti, head of research at Digital Asset Solutions. Additionally, international support comes from figures such as Joana Cotar, a German politician and Bitcoin activist, who critiques the European Union-backed digital currency. This initiative complements Switzerland’s burgeoning role as a pivotal hub for blockchain and crypto innovation, underscored by the significant expansion of Crypto Valley, a leading blockchain and web3 center. In 2023, the valuation of the top 50 entities in Crypto Valley soared to $382.93 billion, featuring prominent organizations such as the Cardano Foundation, Ethereum Foundation, Nexo, and Metaco, a custody solution owned by Ripple. Furthermore, the city of Lugano announced in December its plan to accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for tax payments, reinforcing the nation’s progressive stance on digital currencies. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

230::https://cryptobriefing.com/vanguard-ceo-ramji-appointment/::Crypto Briefing::article::Vanguard set to appoint ex-BlackRock ETF chief as next CEO: WSJ::Salim Ramji will replace Tim Buckley, marking the first time Vanguard appoints an outsider as CEO.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Salim Ramji, former head of BlackRock’s exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and index investing, is set to take the helm at Vanguard Group as chief executive officer starting July 8, according to a Tuesday report from WSJ. As noted, Ramji will succeed Tim Buckley, who announced his departure in February after over 30 years with Vanguard. The former BlackRock executive had spent over 10 years at the world’s leading asset management firm and played a key role in its spot Bitcoin ETF journey. Unlike Ramji, Buckley’s tenure at Vanguard was marked by a firm stance against Bitcoin ETFs. Briefly after the debut of spot Bitcoin funds in the US, Vanguard announced the removal of its Bitcoin futures ETF product from its trading brokerage platform. Vanguard’s decision not to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs is rooted in its belief that Bitcoin is more of a speculation than an investment, and the firm does not see an appropriate role for crypto in long-term investment portfolios. Despite facing criticism and boycott calls, Vanguard remains resolute in its traditional investment philosophy, prioritizing long-term stability over short-term gains. With the latest appointment, there is speculation about potential shifts in Vanguard’s stance on crypto assets. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, however, believes the firm is unlikely to tap into Bitcoin ETFs anytime soon. Still think it’s unlikely that this means vanguard launches a #Bitcoin ETF (at least near term). But I think Salim could reverse Vanguard’s stance on not allowing their clients to buy spot Bitcoin ETFs on their brokerage platform 👀 https://t.co/ZMDKM1Uy6Q — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) May 14, 2024 The move also marks the first time in Vanguard’s history that an outsider has been appointed CEO. Traditionally, the company has filled senior positions from within its ranks. This break from tradition suggests a possible change in strategy, indicating that Vanguard might be looking to outsiders to bring fresh perspectives.

231::https://theconversation.com/three-ways-blockchain-could-get-the-world-to-act-against-the-climate-crisis-139503::The Conversation::article::Three ways blockchain could get the world to act against the climate crisis::A decentralised climate organisation, based on blockchain, could help get the world to work together to act against climate change.::The world has failed to halt global warming. Four years after the signing of the Paris Agreement, most experts predict global warming will exceed the agreed thresholds, with disastrous consequences. As much as the world faces a climate crisis, it also faces a climate governance crisis: we know what must be done to halt climate change but we do not know yet how to get there. New mechanisms are evidently needed. Blockchain is one technology that has the potential to boost global cooperation for climate action, as I explore in new research. Blockchain is a data structure that stores information as a series of cryptographically linked blocks, which are distributed simultaneously to all participants in a network. The information stored on a blockchain is tamper-resistant. This is useful for generating a single source of truth for any kind of information. Blockchain technology provides the building blocks for what are known as decentralised autonomous organisations, which have been discussed (and criticised) as potential alternative governance mechanisms at the national level. But the benefits of such a decentralised organisation at the international level would be much higher. Imagine a decentralised climate organisation, based on blockchain, in which states, companies, and individuals participate and whose interactions are facilitated by so-called smart contracts. These contracts are pieces of computer code running on top of the blockchain, which makes them virtually unstoppable. A common token — let us call it greencoin — allows climate commitments by states to be linked with the flourishing ecosystem of transnational climate initiatives and individual climate action. Such an organisation would help get the world together to act against climate change in three ways. Coordinated action against climate change requires better information. One important task is to ensure that different stakeholders do not claim carbon credits for the same carbon-offsetting activity, such as two companies paying for the same forest to be planted. To avoid such double-counting, a publicly shared digital ledger of carbon credits, as currently piloted by the Pacific Alliance nations, would offer a more cost-effective solution than a central agency settling transactions of carbon credits. Read more: Double counting of emissions cuts may undermine Paris climate deal Another (more challenging) task would be to verify that carbon-offsetting activities have actually occurred. Blockchain technology, combined with information feeds such as internet-of-things devices, could tap new information sources. Meanwhile, smart contracts offer an efficient way to reward critical tasks like verifying emission reductions and adaptation measures at the local level. Climate change is an area ripe with broken promises. Consider the decision by US President Donald Trump to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. In other countries, worries have grown that the COVID-19 pandemic will thwart government efforts to honour their climate-related commitments. Through smart contracts, blockchain technology could mitigate the risk of backsliding, provided that states underpinned their commitments with a monetary deposit. If states fail to comply with their emission reduction targets, their deposit could be taken and redistributed as greencoins to those that have abated carbon emissions, for example by planting trees, or other climate action. More effective enforcement of commitments through smart contracts is only possible where resources have been staked upon commitments. An added benefit of eliminating uncertainty around enforcement is to entice more ambitious climate commitments from those who are concerned about being cheated upon by more powerful bodies. Business as usual will not be enough to confront the impending climate crisis. A decentralised climate organisation would allow progressive transnational bodies to “buy” pro-climate transformation in laggard countries. For example, transnational corporations including Apple, Google and Walmart, ExxonMobil, BP, Shell, and other firms criticised the US decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. Under a decentralised climate organisation, they could have devised smart contracts offering compensation to affected workers in exchange for more robust commitment by the US government to decarbonise the economy.  A related benefit of this approach would be to make their demands transparent, which would help less powerful bodies hold corporations to account on their climate-related pledges. For example, Microsoft recently announced it would invest US$1 billion to become a carbon-negative enterprise. This is all very well, but it could be rhetoric. If Microsoft underpinned this pledge by a smart contract with an appropriate stake, it would become inevitable, with huge benefits for everyone whose fortunes depend on powerful players like Microsoft following through on their promises. A decentralised climate organisation would combine the resources of billions and unite their efforts in combating climate change. Anyone in a blockchain network connected to the system could earn greencoins by planting trees (like “mining” in the Bitcoin system). This would be profitable because greencoins have real value — they would be linked to the international commitments by states that have staked monetary resources on them. People could also purchase greencoins to support climate action. By increasing the exchange value of greencoins, these people would provide incentives for more rapid tree-planting. Blockchain technology is ideally suited to settle these transactions automatically, provided appropriate systems for verification and the incentive system underlying effective decentralised verification are in place. Blockchain-based climate governance has undeniable theoretical benefits, but there would be significant obstacles to its realisation. While the blockchain ensures that once-recorded data is tamper-resistant, it can do little to ensure that the data that is brought onto the blockchain can be trusted. Start-ups like Chainlink have proposed decentralised networks of information feeds as a promising solution to this problem, but for some applications, suitable solutions are hard to find. A blockchain-based climate organisation might not come to fruition if key players decided not to join. Powerful states or companies might be especially unwilling to participate in a system that makes broken promises immediately transparent and that automates the punishment process. But as long as there was enough momentum, they might slowly be incentivised to get involved. A virtual entity for climate governance would also require people to accept to be governed by algorithms. And at the moment, this might be the hardest challenge of all.::2020-06-11T12:13:08Z::Blockchain, Climate action, Climate crisis, Cryptocurrency, Interdisciplinarity, Paris Agreement::Bernhard Reinsberg::Environment::https://images.theconversation.com/files/339801/original/file-20200604-67351-1sxbfws.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
232::https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/05/13/why-for-some-crypto-is-the-defining-political-issue-of-our-times/::CoinDesk::article::Why, for Some, Crypto Is the Defining Political Issue of Our Times::It’d be foolish for people to vote against their own interests.::With all due respect to Molly Jane Zuckerman and Jeff Albus, the co-authors of a recent Blockworks column discounting the idea of voting for pro-crypto politicians in the upcoming election in the U.S., voting your conscience is a good thing. Despite the headline (“Only a fool would vote on crypto alone”), the piece was fairly measured – but it certainly struck a nerve. Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates. This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here. “Voting for a candidate you would not otherwise support, simply because they favor the deregulation of a sector in which you hold a profit motive, is a compromise that you should not make,” editors Zuckerman and Albus wrote. They certainly aren’t the first to express this sentiment. Fortune editor Jeff John Roberts has argued that crypto’s increasing alignment with Trump supporters like Sen. Tom Emmer is a bad deal. While all these folks are right to some extent that political support for crypto is often more about peoples’ bags rather than a moral crusade, it is undeniable that crypto is an increasingly relevant political issue. And for some, it is the defining issue of our times. Crypto isn’t just an investment opportunity, it’s a movement, a philosophy and a way of life – and there are true believers. Zuckerman and Albus’ issue is nominally about crypto becoming a “single-issue vote,” whether cast in favor of Democrat or Republican candidates – but in reality, the whole conversation they tapped into is really about whether to vote for Trump. For some crypto supporters, the issue is existential; another four years of Biden means more wanton regulation by enforcement, more gridlock preventing actual crypto legislation and more anti-crypto rhetoric coming from the highest political office. During President Biden’s reign, U.S. legislators and regulators have become increasingly hostile to crypto, and their actions are undeniably having an outsized impact on the direction of an entire global industry. Just last week, for instance, re-staking platform EigenLayer, called one of the most important blockchain innovations since the launch of Ethereum a decade ago, was heavily criticized for designing a highly restrictive airdrop. But, under the current regulatory regime, it was essentially EigenLayer’s only move unless it wanted to invite a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit. It is true that crypto has bipartisan support, however it is clear (and frankly has been for years) that crypto gets more love from Republicans. Politico reports that a critical vote – “the first time a full chamber of Congress has taken up a big crypto policy bill” – is essentially dead on arrival with a Democrat controlled House and Senate. Meanwhile, the most vocal supporters of crypto in office today are Republicans, figures like Sens. Emmer and Cynthia Lummis. So can you really blame people like Ryan Selkis, Mike Dudas or Mark Cuban for thinking if they want decent crypto policy in the U.S., the industry has to align itself with Republicans? Critics might be right in saying that former President Donald Trump, who gave a ringing endorsement of crypto at a Mar-a-Lago dinner last week, only recently took a shine to crypto because he’s made millions selling NFTs or because it’s another way for him to paint President Biden as out of touch. But these moments count. At a time when the entire U.S. crypto industry feels like it’s under assault by the government, it is likely a welcome feeling knowing someone with as much influence as Trump is willing to speak out in support. See also: Will Biden Get the Final Say Over a Controversial Crypto Rule? | Opinion I understand that many people think crypto’s vote being cast for Trump is like drinking from a poisoned chalice. After all, when in office, Trump’s cabinet tried (and failed) to push through emergency rules that would have banned “self-hosted wallets,” i.e. exactly what makes crypto a viable technology in the first place. There is no guarantee that if reelected Trump would actually be any more favorable to crypto than Biden is currently; and it seems highly unlikely that either candidate fully understands or appreciates why crypto is technologically potent. I understand that, ideally, voters should care more about things like abortion, environmental and immigration policy than crypto. (Most probably do.) I understand Zuckerman and Albus’ distaste for Trump, his sexual assault charges, alleged fraud and election denialism. I understand why, optically, crypto casting itself as conservative is a dubious proposition, an expedient way to get 40+% of the population to turn their minds against it, as Laura Shin astutely pointed out. See also: Crypto Is an Election Issue This Year. Is That a Good Thing? | Opinion But I also understand why figures like Selkis are championing crypto into a political cause. Actually, they are simply noticing that crypto already was a partisan issue and acting in accordance. It’s common to hear that because blockchains strive to be “credibly neutral” that the industry itself is apolitical, but that simply isn't true. Crypto is a check on the government; it is and always has been a political project. As I wrote in 2021: “If Bitcoin solved the climate crisis, it would be through successful, freer markets – not progressive planning. If Bitcoin expands access to basic financial services, it could never solve economic inequality – you cannot redistribute early Bitcoiners’ massive holdings without destroying the system’s technologically protected property rights. If Bitcoin prevents war by diminishing the power of the state, it will also dismantle the progressive welfare state.” To be clear: I’m not arguing for anyone to vote in any particular way. Frankly, I agree that ideally crypto wouldn’t be an election issue. I wish it weren’t politicized. But crypto exists in the context of all other issues, and is currently being affected by politics. And it’s perfectly natural that people who think about and use crypto everyday would elevate it as the most important issue – especially considering that it’s not only a philosophy but an investment. It is unclear why anyone would suggest people vote against their interests. For some, crypto is a microcosm of all else that’s important – because in the end, it’s all about letting people determine for themselves what to value.

233::https://beincrypto.com/boosting-ownership-and-interoperability-in-blockchain-gaming/::BeInCrypto::article::Fostering Ownership and Interoperability in the Blockchain Gaming Ecosystem::Here, we discuss how blockchain gaming is transforming the gaming industry by enhancing ownership and interoperability.::We use cookies to improve your experience. The once-niched gaming world and its very peculiar demography are completely metamorphosing and adapting to blockchain technology and its immense potential. While “play-to-earn” models have understandably garnered the most attention, the impact of blockchain reaches far beyond mere financial incentives. A paradigm shift is what we are witnessing. Blockchain goes beyond financial incentives, enabling ownership, interoperability, trust, transparency, and impactful community-driven development. It is no longer fancy to own cartridges and controllers because the future of gaming is being built on the blockchain, and this is an adventure beyond what any pixelated screen could ever offer you. It isn’t about grinding for gaming assets, it’s about owning them, wielding them across gaming worlds, and reshaping the way gameplay is experienced. In this article, we’ll delve into the diverse ways blockchain technology is revolutionizing the gaming industry, unlocking captivating possibilities for players, developers, and the industry. Remember the days when you played games dedicatedly and meticulously upgraded your avatar only to see it disappear when the game servers shut down? That feeling of fleeting ownership is something blockchain-powered gaming has erased. Blockchain’s immutable ledger empowers players with verifiable ownership of virtual items. Imagine wielding a legendary sword in a game that you can transform from just pixels and excitement into a prized possession, imbued with digital ownership and tradable on decentralized marketplaces. Just like that, your virtual possessions hold real value, fostering a sense of pride and investment in your digital identity. This shift towards true ownership is transforming the industry, with the market for utility-driven Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) estimated to grow by 35% to $13.6 billion by 2027. Blockchain technology also enables a true sense of scarcity via the creation of scarce assets represented as NFTs. The limited supply of NFTs ensures their rarity and value, just like limited editions of comic books or games. Imagine owning a unique spaceship in a space exploration game, knowing only a handful of others —or none — exist in the entire game’s ecosystem. This scarcity adds a layer of excitement and exclusivity, fueling a thriving digital economy where players can truly own and monetize their in-game achievements. Games like Citizen Conflict are a good example of such NFT-based game model. This model allows players to interact with unique digital assets, which demonstrates the broader trend of integrating blockchain technology into gaming to enhance ownership and value. Blockchain-based games are shattering boundaries. They are allowing players to move their assets and achievements across different platforms. This was unthinkable some ten years ago. But in an era of interoperability, you can now flourish in a vast interconnected ecosystem of games with the assets you own. Imagine utilizing resources you’ve gathered in a thriving virtual farm to build your dream home in a bustling cyberpunk metropolis. What used to be a fantasy is now reality. One fueled by blockchain technology. With the help of standardized protocols and tokenized assets, different block-based games can connect and interact, creating a seamless experience for players and unlocking a universe of possibilities. Interoperability fosters a richer, more interconnected gaming ecosystem, breaking down barriers and creating exciting possibilities for collaboration and innovation. With the global blockchain gaming market projected to grow from $154.46 billion in 2023 to $614.91 billion in 2030 at a CAGR of 21.8% during 2023-2030, interoperability is poised to play a vital part in this market. Traditionally, game development has been an exclusive club where wealthy technology companies play. The blockchain has decentralized the field and empowers independent developers and communities with innovative tools and funding mechanisms. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) allow passionate groups to collectively fund and govern game development, fostering greater transparency and shared ownership. Imagine a community funding and actively participating in the development of a unique game, fueled by collective passion and the blockchain’s inherent transparency. In March 2023, the value of DAOs reached a record $25.1 billion. This immense value is paving the way for diverse and innovative experiences driven by the power of community. Beyond funding, this democratization empowers independent minds to bring their visions to life. It creates a future where anyone with a spark of creativity can join the game development revolution and improve on the models already existing like play-to-earn, NFTs, etc. We are fast moving away from the era of blindly trusting in developers. That era is being replaced by an era of transparency and trust built on the immutable foundation of blockchain technology. The blockchain transparently displays every random number generation algorithm and every governance decision. It is this transparency that the blockchain is bringing to the gaming industry. With every action and transaction verifiable on the blockchain, players can gain unprecedented insight into the inner workings of the games they play. This eliminates concerns about manipulation and pay-to-win mechanics, fostering a level playing field where skill reigns supreme. Players now no longer have to blindly accept hidden mechanics. They can actively participate in shaping the game’s future through on-chain governance proposals and transparent decision-making processes. This collaborative approach proves how the blockchain paves the way for a gaming future built on trust, transparency, and empowered communities. Beyond just grinding and finding excitement, blockchain opens doors to innovative play models beyond just play-to-earn. Guilds are forming and pooling resources to tackle challenging in-game tasks as seen during the period when Axie Infinity was a prominent game in the industry. Players can get exclusive access to content or early game participation through subscription models. Tokenized economies can reward players for contributing to the game world. These diverse models cater to different player preferences and create exciting new ways to engage with games. The blockchain, especially its integration into the gaming industry, is still in its early stages. This means that challenges remain, and there are scalability, regulatory uncertainty, and user education hurdles to overcome. Yet, the potential is undeniable. By fostering ownership, interoperability, and community-driven development, blockchain has the power to reshape the gaming landscape, creating a more inclusive, transparent, and exciting experience for players and developers alike.

235::https://coinatory.com/cryptocurrency-news/u-s-treasury-dispatches-2-billion-in-bitcoin-to-coinbase-from-silk-road-seizure-18132/::Coinatory::article::U.S. Treasury Dispatches $2 Billion in Bitcoin to Coinbase from Silk Road Seizure::Discover the U.S. government's recent $2 billion Bitcoin transfer to Coinbase from the notorious Silk Road seizure. Unveiling implications for the crypto market and government strategy.::In a notable move within the cryptocurrency sector, the United States government executed a significant transaction, transferring a cache of Bitcoins previously confiscated from the infamous darknet marketplace, Silk Road, to the prominent cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase. This transaction, confirmed by blockchain analytics platform Blockchair on April 2, involved the movement of 30,175 Bitcoins (BTC) to Coinbase, representing an approximate value of $2 billion, given the prevailing Bitcoin price of around $65,000. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT highlighted an additional, albeit minuscule, transaction where 0.001 BTC, equivalent to $69, was moved to a Coinbase deposit address, presumably as a preliminary test. This follows the government’s history of disposing of seized cryptocurrencies; notably, in March 2023, it liquidated 9,861 BTC, then valued at $216 million, from a batch seized in late 2022 totaling about 50,000 BTC from Silk Road. Furthermore, in January 2024, federal authorities expressed plans to offload a segment of the cryptocurrency amassed from Silk Road, specifically citing 2,934 BTC. Another significant transaction occurred at the end of February when the government moved 15,085 BTC—assets seized from the compromised cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, worth approximately $947 million—to undisclosed destinations. This included a precursory transfer of one BTC, followed by movements of 2,817 BTC ($172.7 million) and 12,267 BTC ($748.5 million) from secondary wallets. Arkham Intelligence reports that an additional stash of approximately 94,600 BTC, seized from Bitfinex hackers, remains in another government-controlled wallet. According to CryptoQuant, the collective holdings of the U.S. government in BTC are estimated at 210,392, valued at $14.4 billion, positioning it among the foremost Bitcoin proprietors globally. The last individual Bitcoin sale conducted by U.S. agencies, including the Department of Justice and the Internal Revenue Service, occurred in July 2023. Since that transaction, the government’s unrealized Bitcoin profits have surged by 240%, underscoring the volatile yet lucrative nature of cryptocurrency investments. This strategic maneuver by the U.S. government not only underscores the substantial impact of regulatory and legal actions on the cryptocurrency market but also highlights the increasing involvement of state entities in the burgeoning digital currency space. The implications of this significant transfer for both the market and regulatory landscape remain a focal point for investors and analysts alike. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

236::https://cryptobriefing.com/ubs-blackrock-3600-shares-btc-etf/::Crypto Briefing::article::Swiss bank UBS holds 3,600 shares in BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, SEC filings show::A recent SEC filing from UBS reveals that the Swiss bank holds a significant number of shares in BlackRock's IBIT.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article In a recent 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), UBS Group AG, the Switzerland-based global investment bank and financial services firm, disclosed a substantial holding in the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), an exchange-traded fund (ETF) managed by BlackRock Inc. The filing, which covers the first quarter of 2024, reveals that UBS Group AG, through its various subsidiaries and institutional investment managers, holds 3,600 shares in IBIT. This investment highlights the growing interest of traditional financial institutions in the crypto space, particularly in Bitcoin. Data from Fintel shows that the holding is valued at $145,692 as of March 31, 2024, with a current value of $124,488. The iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that provides investors with exposure to Bitcoin, the world’s leading cryptocurrency. IBIT enables investors to access Bitcoin within a traditional brokerage account, making it more convenient and accessible compared to holding Bitcoin directly. IBIT, managed by BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers, offers investors a convenient way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities associated with holding the cryptocurrency directly, such as storage, security, and tax reporting. As of May 10, 2024, IBIT had net assets of $16.6 billion and a net expense ratio of 0.12%. The relationship between UBS Group AG and BlackRock Inc. is noteworthy, as BlackRock is one of the institutional shareholders of UBS, holding approximately 5.01% of total share capital, which represents a substantial percentage of ownership in the Swiss financial giant. UBS Group AG’s investment in IBIT through its various segments, including Global Wealth Management, Personal and Corporate Banking, Asset Management, and Investment Bank, demonstrates the firm’s strategic interest in the crypto market and a potential avenue for portfolio diversification.

237::https://theconversation.com/bitcoins-high-energy-consumption-is-a-concern-but-it-may-be-a-price-worth-paying-106282::The Conversation::article::Bitcoin’s high energy consumption is a concern – but it may be a price worth paying::Bitcoin may have a large carbon footprint, but cleaner digital currencies aren’t going to prevent an environmental disaster.::Bitcoin recently turned ten years old. In that time, it has proved revolutionary because it ignores the need for modern money’s institutions to verify payments. Instead, Bitcoin relies on cryptographic techniques to prove identity and authenticity. However, the price to pay for all of this innovation is a high carbon footprint, created by Bitcoin mining. Fundamental to that mining process is a peer-to-peer network of computers, referred to as validators, who perform Proof of Work. In essence, this involves computers solving computationally-intensive cryptographic puzzles that prove blocks of transactions, which are recorded in a public asset ledger, known as a blockchain. This ledger is publicly viewable by all computers, which helps the system achieve consensus in an unreliable network of participants. Validators are called miners because the computer, or node, that successfully validates one of those blocks is rewarded with “mined” Bitcoin. Thus mining is also the process by which Bitcoin adds new coins to the network. But these processes consume a vast amount of power. In my 2016 article, Socialism and the Blockchain, I estimated Bitcoin mining’s annual energy use at 3.38 TeraWatt hours (TWh), which I equated to the total 2014 annual consumption of Jamaica. Recent estimates show the currency’s annual consumption rising exponentially, currently reaching an incredible 55TWh. Indeed, a new paper in Nature Sustainability suggests that the energy costs of mining cryptocurrencies exceed the costs of mining physical metals. Furthermore, the paper estimates that Bitcoin emitted between 3m and 13m metric tonnes CO₂ in the first half of 2018. A team in Hawaii even suppose that, if Bitcoin’s adoption continues to rise, within a couple of decades, such emissions could help push global warming above 2°C. However, both the study in Nature and the team in Hawaii make assumptions about the means of energy generation. In the light of the recent disturbing UN 1.5°C Report, humanity would be wise to act on the recommendation for an “unprecedented shift in energy systems”. The hope is that such a shift towards large-scale renewable energy does occur, thus invalidating the assumptions made in those papers. Nevertheless, concerns over Bitcoin’s energy consumption remain, so Ethereum, another cryptocurrency, is investigating a more energy efficient consensus algorithm known as Proof of Stake. This method differs from Proof of Work because miners on this network use their economic stake to prove transactions and therefore, they are not performing energy intensive calculations. That introduces some complications – not least, how to ensure that people in this network act honestly, as they would have nothing to lose by behaving dishonestly? Ethereum’s proposed solution is to introduce penalties through measures such as penalising miners for simultaneously producing blocks on two versions of the blockchain. After all, only one of those blockchains is valid. Bitcoin’s Proof of Work overcomes such problems implicitly because it includes natural penalties since miners have to expend energy to prove transactions. In economic game theory, a Nash Equilibrium is said to be reached when a system stabilises because no one gains by changing strategy from that which produces the stable state. Since Bitcoin rewards are given to miners only if their blocks help form the valid Bitcoin blockchain, the most profitable outcome, or the Nash Equilibrium, is for each miner to act in consensus with the majority. As a result, Bitcoin’s Proof of Work algorithm has proven effective, despite the excessive energy consumption. In essence, my work looks at whether blockchains are a rebuttal to the hierarchies of capitalism. If Bitcoin promotes a way of organising that does not rely on capitalist consumption, might that indirectly drive down society’s energy use and help lessen its environmental impact? After all, consider the recent alarming WWF report, which all but blamed capitalism for the dramatic decline in wildlife populations. We need alternatives. Perhaps, then, Bitcoin’s revolutionary offer, as an alternative to capitalism, means its energy use is a price worth paying? That argument holds some weight if it drives down consumption in other areas of society because Bitcoin mining is not the primary driver behind climate change. However, even then, given the urgency of environmental degradation, if we continue to produce energy in a manner that creates so much warming CO₂, that argument may provide scant consolation. Perhaps alternative consensus schemes, such as Ethereum’s Proof of Stake, provide part of the solution. However, Bitcoin or not, if humankind is to avoid climate catastrophe, we need to take urgent action and find solutions that produce clean, sustainable energy. If we do that, humanity will benefit, and as a by-product, so will Bitcoin.::2018-11-07T12:30:02Z::Bitcoin, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, Energy use, Environment, Ethereum, Global warming::Steve Huckle::Environment::https://images.theconversation.com/files/244074/original/file-20181106-74754-vhzma2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
238::https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/05/13/ai-agents-will-drive-the-next-wave-of-crypto-adoption/::CoinDesk::article::AI Agents Will Drive the Next Wave of Crypto Adoption::Crypto agents are here already and they will get more and more advanced until we use them to run our financial lives, says Luke Saunders, CTO at Delphi Labs. How we get there::In the 2000s, we stopped going into bank branches and started banking online. In 10 years time, do you think we will still be managing our finances this way? I predict today’s online financial tools will soon look archaic as we increasingly manage our finances via agents - intelligent bots that conduct financial operations on our behalf. Luke Saunders is a Partner at Delphi Ventures and CTO at Delphi Labs. That may sound far-fetched, but agents are already here. A liquidation bot is an agent. An arbitrage bot is an agent. The person who created it can chill on their sofa while the agent runs in the background making them money. They are niche but there are thousands of such things performing on-chain actions today on behalf of others. Bots/agents are not people. The world of aesthetically pleasing apps with nice buttons to click does not work for them. TradFi provides APIs, but these are often half baked, closed-source, with limited documentation and inconsistent with each other. It’s very difficult for an agent (or anyone honestly) to figure out how to use them. As I wrote in a recent post on X, while crypto UX is cumbersome for humans, its transparent, open-source, and programmable nature is absolutely perfect for agents. Code is a first class citizen here. Everything an agent needs to figure out how to achieve a goal — the source code and the data — is public. Half-baked TradFi APIs can't compete with this. The best agents will be built on the best platform and there is no better platform than crypto. This isn’t our reality yet, but there is a path to get us there. Let’s jump back to the agents that exist today and explore how we get from here to there. The agents mentioned earlier (liquidation bots, etc) meet the definition of an agent, being autonomous software entities, but they are still very basic. They are usually coded specifically for a single, narrow task and without any ChatGPT-like interface to receive instructions and deliver feedback. Big firms like Jump and GSR are able to build more complex systems able to autonomously move money around and handle problems to some extent. But these companies have a lot of money and big teams of devs. It’s not so feasible for the little guy. Technology always progresses to lower the barrier, though. What previously took a computer the size of a house and a team of scientists is later achievable by a teenager and a phone. As AI becomes more prevalent, the nuts and bolts of which smart contract functions to call, or comprehending the data within the contract’s state, can be abstracted away. This leaves the creator/owner able to give much higher level instructions while the agent figures out how to execute them. We can see today that LLMs like GPT-4 are already capable of understanding the intent behind a user’s message, and reason intelligently about how to respond, while at the same time having read all of the text on the internet to inform its answer. So it’s not a big leap to imagine a text-based interface to an agent that has read all relevant crypto media, ingested and understood all the data from all the blockchains, AND has the ability to execute actions on-chain. Think about what people in crypto are spending all their time doing today: The airdrop hunter who is spending all day finding promising new projects which seem like they might do an airdrop, guessing which actions might be rewarded and then doing them. An agent can do all that. The meme hunter who is following some internal algo for finding new meme-coins with signs of cultish community, then buying them, then selling when interest seems to wane. An agent can do all that. But more importantly consider how the new AI agent interface paradigm simplifies the basics of finance: You: “I have 100,000 USDC. Get me the best low risk yield you can find. I need instant access to it so don’t lock it up for more than a week.” Agent: “No problem. I recommend an initial distribution of 50% in Aave, 20% in Ethena, 20% in X and 10% in Y. I will monitor rates and watch for changes in their risk levels, rebalancing as necessary.” You: “Sounds good, do it.” People wonder how MetaMask will ever get unseated, or how frontends can be decentralized. Perhaps the answer is in the future we don’t need frontends anyway, and MetaMask will be replaced by your in-agent wallet. TradFi agents will exist, but agents built on crypto will be better. And that’s why this is important: if agents become more and more common as I expect they will, and crypto agents offer a better experience for users, then this drives more and more users, activity and value on-chain. Crypto sometimes feels like a solution searching for a problem, but maybe it just happens to be the perfect financial system for the machines.

With over ten years of investing and building in fast-growing technology products and the blockchain industry, I’ve come to understand that to stay ahead, providing innovative solutions that can affect the industry and the world at large. I should know. I have invested in many companies with this characteristic. Even though the blockchain industry is still in its nascent stages, plenty of sub-niches and narratives have come to the fore. These technologies are reshaping the blockchain landscape, and in this article, we will delve into this subject, taking you through some of the niches that are revolutionizing their respective areas and how interconnected they are. This sector has seen consistent growth because of its importance to the entire industry. Data privacy and security are vital in today’s blockchain world for obvious reasons. The risks associated with data breaches and cyber-attacks have increased as personal, financial, and confidential information gets increasingly stored and transferred digitally. In 2023, the global average cost of a data breach reached a record high of $4.45 million. This rise in these attacks can be attributed to how the blockchain is structured. It is a ledger containing a record of all transactions taking place on a network. A key feature of blockchain technology is its immutability. Once a block (containing a unique code known as a hash) gets added to the chain, it can neither be altered nor deleted. This provides data stored on the blockchain with tamper-proof security. However, despite what seems to be an airtight layer to the blockchain, some bad actors have succeeded in exploiting the system. In the fight to counter these blockchain exploitations and hackings, privacy-focused protocols have become popular. Think of them as installing a sophisticated alarm system for your digital assets, utilizing clever incentives and independent reputation systems to deter unwanted intrusions. Because we operate in an industry where data breaches cost projects millions, the importance of privacy-focused companies cannot be overstated. COIIN Network Protocol—the parent company of Raiinmaker—is a good example of a company playing in the privacy landscape. Scalability in blockchain refers to the speed of transactions. The ability to support high transaction throughput is both critical and a significant challenge for the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry. And this makes it a very essential aspect in the future growth of blockchain. Achieving an improved level of scalability comes at the cost of reduced decentralization and to a large extent, security. As you note these, it is also important to note that scalability is vital in helping blockchain networks compete effectively with conventional platforms. The question here should now be: how possible is it to provide effective blockchain scalability solutions that do not affect the core tenets of blockchain which are decentralization and security? I present to you layer-1 solutions. Also known as the “first layer,” it requires changes in the code base of the blockchain network. One reason they’re dubbed on-chain scaling solutions. They focus on improving the main features and characteristics of the blockchain network like increasing the block size limit or reducing the block verification time. Ethereum has a transaction speed of around 15 Transactions Per Second (TPS), and Bitcoin is around 7TPS. Both blockchains now have scalability solutions in Sharding and Lightening network respectively, but other solutions are popping up. A popular one is the layer-1 platform Self Chain. It is a Modular Intent-Centric Access Layer-1 blockchain and keyless wallet infrastructure service using MPC-TSS/AA for multi-chain Web3 access. This sector has changed the way the world sees gaming forever. I say this because it is our reality now. Play-to-earn games are a set of blockchain-powered games that allow players to earn in-game rewards represented by Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and tokens. These rewards have real-world value and players can earn them by progressing through the different levels of a game. The in-game assets earned can be weapons, tokens, lands, and skins. Players can trade or transfer these assets on open marketplaces in exchange for real fiat currencies. The gaming industry is huge and boasts an impressive number of people actively participating in it. There were over 3 billion gamers in the industry in 2021. This number of people actively engaged in games helped the industry generate hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue. That revenue has been projected to reach $533 billion by 2027. In 2022, the P2E market size was valued at $32.9 billion, and it is expected to grow to $88.6 billion by 2028, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 17.93%. Some of the best P2E platforms in the industry include Axie Infinity, Creo Engine, The Sandbox, Splinterlands, Decentraland, etc. How we carry out transactions and store data has changed since the advent of blockchain technology. Blockchains have their own standards and set of rules that govern them. In most cases, these are rarely compatible with other chains and have led to an ecosystem where blockchains cannot interact due to their silo-styled operation. A solution to this issue is blockchain bridges. These are known as cross-chain bridges because they allow the transfer of tokens and data from blockchain to blockchain. A benefit of bridging in blockchain is being able to expand the functionality of a chain. This is an important tool for communication among different blockchains. A good example of this would be Dechat Protocol, which prides itself as an open, secure web3 communications protocol that powers decentralized user interactions. The largest asset class in the world, the Real Estate sector is another industry where blockchain technology is having a significant impact. A large portion of the world’s economic assets and transactions is constituted by commercial real estate. According to the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), the total size of tokenized illiquid assets, including real estate and natural resources could reach $16.1 trillion by 2030. This proves how big the real estate market is. While traditional real estate investment can be a daunting maze, with high entry barriers and limited accessibility, blockchain technology is slowly demystifying it. Blockchain protocols are now being used to process securities, documents, and accounting, and manage liability. With blockchain technology, you can also own a fraction of a property, which reduces the barrier of entry massively, thereby giving small-scale investors a chance to get into the real estate market. Fractionet is a good example of a protocol currently doing this. While these various niches might seem very distinct, they are all part of the same vibrant ecosystem that’s the blockchain. The privacy-focused protocol can be used to protect sensitive data used in DeFi transactions—a technology that backs the entire play-to-earn gaming economy. The scalable blockchain facilitates seamless communication that the bridge encourages. And think of the fractional ownership platform offering investment opportunities fueled by DeFi liquidity. My point is that these projects intertwine, and they create a synergistic ecosystem where innovation thrives.

The $33 million it raised came from a seed and Series A round. Investors included Ribbit Capital, Variant, Cyberstarts, Sequoia Capital, and Greylock Partners. Blockaid, as the name suggests, aids in blockchain security by scanning transactions originating from wallets, as well as ones that interact with dapps and smart contracts. Its tools are also compatible with most blockchains. The company claims that in just the last three months it has scanned 450 million user transactions and has subsequently thwarted 1.2 million of them that were deemed malicious. Web3 gaming had a major win this week. Read more: Amazon and Immutable team up to advance Web3 gaming Neon Machine, the studio behind crypto-enabled first person shooter game “Shrapnel”, raised $20 million in a Series A round led by Polychain Capital. Griffin Gaming Partners, Brevan Howard Digital, Franklin Templeton, IOSG Ventures, and Tess Ventures also invested. It’s a free-to-play multiplayer title that is trying to mimic Call of Duty. In-game apparel, such as weapons, will be offered as NFTs on Shrapnel’s private Avalanche network. The fundraise will go toward further developing the game ahead of its planned launch sometime in 2024. An early version of the game could be made available by December. Emerging from stealth this week was smlXL, pronounced “small XL.” The crypto startup, backed by a16z, raised $13.4 million from Greylock and other angel investors. Dor Levi, who was previously at Lyft, founded smXL. The firm employs 16 people as of now and is behind evm.storage, a blockchain explorer that allows users to look up the storage of any individual contract on Ethereum or Avalanche. The company also created evm.codes, which catalogs EVM opcodes. Read more: Time to declare EVM the winner? Not yet, says Helius CEO Mumtaz Its products have 15,000 active monthly users, according to Fortune.

While gold and Bitcoin are commonly viewed as hedges against inflation and esteemed assets, this year has highlighted a significant split in investment choices. Recent figures indicate that gold ETFs have seen outflows of around $4.6 billion. On the flip side, Bitcoin ETFs, which received the green light from the SEC on January 11, have attracted a whopping $8 billion in net investments, setting a historical high for these financial vehicles. The debate comparing Bitcoin with physical assets such as gold, particularly regarding their lack of yield, is becoming increasingly popular among investors, particularly in the context of the low-interest environment during the Covid pandemic. Current trends point to expectations of changes in monetary policy, global political instability, and worries about possible declines in the stock market as having a growing impact on the pricing dynamics of gold. Bitcoin’s price, meanwhile, reached its highest level in more than two years on a Tuesday, although this peak was brief. The cryptocurrency’s value hit $69,191 before dropping by about 6%, with investors taking profits from the year’s substantial 60% increase. Gold, however, continues to hover near its all-time high of $2,141, reflecting the divergent levels of investor confidence in the two assets amid a turbulent market. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

242::https://cryptobriefing.com/bluesky-decentralization-dorsey/::Crypto Briefing::article::Jack Dorsey criticizes Bluesky for straying from decentralized ethos::Dorsey advocates for alternative revenue models to counter the flaws of advertising-based social media.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article There’s always one or more reasons behind a company board member’s departure. With Jack Dorsey and Bluesky, it’s all about direction. Speaking with Pirates Wires this week, Bluesky’s inventor said the company is straying from its original decentralized ethos and resembling a conventional social media app, the type of app he intended to avoid at the beginning. “This is literally repeating all the mistakes we made as a company. This is not a protocol that’s truly decentralized. It’s another app. It’s another app that’s just kind of following in Twitter’s footsteps, but for a different part of the population,” Dorsey stated. Dorsey’s initial vision for Bluesky was to create a social media protocol that could overcome the challenges faced by centralized platforms, such as those he encountered at Twitter (now X). He expected that Bluesky would support free speech and not be beholden to the constraints of a publicly traded company dependent on advertising revenue. However, as Bluesky developed, it began incorporating more traditional corporate elements, including forming a board and seeking venture capital funding. For a person deeply committed to decentralization, it’s a clear departure from his original goals for the project. “Everything we wanted around decentralization, everything we wanted in terms of an [open-source] protocol, suddenly became a company with VCs and a board. That’s not what I wanted, that’s not what I intended to help create,” Dorsey remarked. According to him, this shift, combined with a growing emphasis on app development and moderation tools, moved Bluesky away from being a truly decentralized protocol. Commenting on the public perception of Bluesky as “anti-Twitter,” Dorsey said it was not the foundational intention. Bluesky was meant to be a neutral protocol rather than a direct competitor. Dorsey also noted the limitations of the advertising-based revenue model for social media platforms, which he believes compromises content policies and platform governance. He suggests alternative revenue streams, such as subscriptions and commerce, could provide a more sustainable and less compromising approach. Earlier this week, the team behind Bluesky announced that Dorsey was no longer on the board of directors. At the time, neither Dorsey nor Bluesky commented publicly on the departure. After leaving Bluesky, Dorsey has turned his attention to Nostr, a protocol he considers a more accurate reflection of his decentralized social media aspirations, operating without a central authority or corporate structure.

243::https://theconversation.com/how-are-bitcoin-cryptowallets-and-blockchain-related-some-jargon-busted-88906::The Conversation::article::How are bitcoin, cryptowallets and blockchain related? Some jargon busted::Using metaphors for cryptocurrencies helps people feel more familiar with the technology. But there’s a downside – we expect it to work just like regular money.::When the bitcoin was first introduced eight years ago, it promised to change payments. People would be able to transact directly with each other, without needing to place their trust in banks – but that promise still hasn’t materialised and adoption of bitcoins is low. We were first told in 2009 that many transactions would be verifiable and validated by the bitcoin protocol. However, as we argued in a recent study, a significant adoption barrier to bitcoin is the lack of usability. Since the inception of cryptocurrency, developers and researchers have been using metaphors to explain bitcoin in a clear effort to help people feel more comfortable with the technology. A secure application for holding bitcoins is dubbed a “cryptowallet”, the trading platforms where people can buy and sell bitcoins are called “exchanges”, and in several locations around the world, ATMs have emerged for bitcoin-based transactions. The production of bitcoins is described as “mining”, but the only similarity between this and mining for gold or valuable gems, is that both processes are very, very difficult to achieve. Finally, bitcoins are called “coins”, even though they are entirely digital. Using metaphors to refer to these technologies helps people feel more familiar with the technology. But there is also a downside: people expect that the technology can be used as regular money. One could easily believe that, in fact, such “coins” are stored in a “wallet”, which leads to further misinterpretations: if these are coins, what do they look like? if it’s real money, how do I get refunds for paying for stuff? and do I get change if I don’t have the exact amount? But the coins don’t exist. They are merely entries in a highly secure, very restricted database. There are no wallets, crypto or otherwise. These are either software applications that may or may not connect to the internet, or hardware-based solutions (similar to USB sticks). ATMs can be used to buy and sell coins, but teller machines do not hold “coins”. And, in the bitcoin world, there are many transactions that can’t mimic how regular money works. If I pay for something with pound notes and then regret my purchase, I can return the item to the shop and the shop may or may not issue a refund. But the bitcoin protocol doesn’t allow this. If a transfer of bitcoins has been broadcast to the network, by design that transaction is final. It means that, had I paid for that item with bitcoins, the shop can’t issue a refund but instead has to process a new payment, or a charge back – which incurs additional processing fees. This isn’t a refund – as some money would be deducted from the full amount I originally paid. To support the adoption of bitcoin as an alternative payment, we need to have a system that is cheaper, better and more desirable compared with other forms of payments, such as debit cards. The bitcoin is cheaper, because – even when paying by debit or credit cards – there is always a fee involved for processing such transactions. Some merchants will pay the fee themselves, or roll this cost over to the consumer, as an extra charge for paying by card. Paying in bitcoins has zero cost or very low cost, subject to how much of a hurry the consumer is in. Everyday transactions in bitcoins are fairly straightforward and security is robust: if I need to pay somebody in bitcoins, I can send the exact amount to that other person’s bitcoin address (a randomly generated sequence of characters, that changes every time there is a transaction) by confirming it with my unique PIN-like number. The rest is done by the miners (more about which later) who need to verify that the transaction is unique and genuine. Despite these clear advantages, bitcoin’s desirability factor remains low. And there is little we can do (at least for now) to increase its uptake. Notably, adoption is also affected by trust perceptions. People are more likely to trust the technology if they have a better understanding of how the bitcoin protocol works. This can be achieved without forcing everybody to become an expert in cryptography. What is bitcoin? It’s one of many cryptocurrencies – but the only one that has grabbed the headlines. It is a type of digital currency, created and regulated by a network of thousands of computers (known as peers) using encryption techniques. Because of this, its production is independent from any authority, such as banks and sovereign states – and trust in the bitcoin is produced by the technology itself. How does this happen? Meet the blockchain: Simply put, the blockchain is a very restricted database, whose entries are the bitcoin transactions. The blockchain operates as a digital ledger of transactions. Just like regular businesses that keep a record of money coming in and going out, users of the cryptocurrency need to record all bitcoin-based transactions. The difference is that the blockchain is a decentralised and distributed, open-access ledger whose records are permanent and verifiable by the network of peers. So everybody can view past transactions, but nobody can alter them without having the consent of the majority. This means that the blockchain doesn’t exhibit weaknesses associated with traditional ledgers. The blockchain technology is secure by design. How are bitcoins produced? Through mining, which is undertaken by the peers of the network. The miners are people and organisations that connect their computers in the network to offer processing power, using special software to solve very difficult algorithms, while leveraging the power of advanced computers and graphic cards. In return for their services (creating new bitcoins, authenticating transactions, maintaining the blockchain), they get rewarded with new bitcoins. Where are bitcoins stored? A cryptowallet – which is a software application that stores private keys (code that looks like a very long PIN) – is where all bitcoins are stored. These private keys are connected to public keys (code again, but the equivalent would be a bank account). The best way to understand how a cryptowallet works is to think of it, in similar terms, as a secure connection between a person’s PIN to their bank account, which then allows them to check balances and make payments. The bitcoin hasn’t become the alternative payment system for consumers that was promised eight years ago. Widespread adoption of the cryptocurrency is hobbled by a number of factors: its reputation is associated far too often with alleged bad boys, and talk of a bubble that’s about to pop persists even as bitcoin continues to surge. But, above all else, few people can cut through the jargon to understand how it actually works. These perceptions can shift if bitcoin-based transactions become easier to comprehend in a way that will help people build trust in the technology. Instead of replicating old paradigms, bitcoin should be embraced as a fresh new way to pay for stuff.::2017-12-15T13:54:55Z::Bitcoin, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, Cryptowallet::Efpraxia D.

Customers will receive $1.18 for every dollar’s worth of crypto assets they held on the exchange at the time of collapse in November 2022, plus interest. This result – rare in the world of bankruptcies, where creditors typically receive pennies on the dollar – has raised a poignant question for some: Was Sam Bankman-Fried right all along? Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates. This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here. For instance, Bloomberg’s Matt Levine opened a recent edition of the (always excellent) “Money Stuff” newsletter getting straight to the point: “FTX was … illiquid but solvent?” That is, in a way, a very simple and direct way of stating what SBF, who was recently sentenced to 25 years in prison for one of the largest financial heists ever, has been saying for years. See also: Could Sam Bankman-Fried's Saga Happen Without Crypto? To make it brief, in the days leading up to FTX’s bankruptcy on Nov. 11, 2022, SBF was frantically trying to shore up a gigantic hole in his company’s balance sheet by raising funds basically from anyone he could. This reportedly includes everyone from Silicon Valley VCs, Saudi money men and even SBF’s archrival ex-CEO of Binance Changpeng Zhao (who reneged on a handshake buyout deal after reviewing the state of FTX’s finances, only speeding up the ongoing run on the exchange). He was trying to raise this money 1) because SBF and his inner circle had become painfully aware of a shortfall in capital needed to meet all customer withdrawals (a balance reportedly shown to prospective investors showed the exchange only had $900 million in liquid assets) and 2) because (and this is debatable) he believed – or said he believed – that there actually was enough capital, it was just illiquid. To wit: "FTX is fine. Assets are fine,” Bankman-Fried infamously tweeted out on Nov. 7 after being confronted by FTX co-founder Gary Wang about the exchange’s $8 billion hole as customer withdrawals began to pick up following Zhao’s announcement that he’d sell Binance’s FTT stack. From the beginning of his ill-fated “media tour” to the end of his trial, SBF routinely characterized FTX’s implosion as due to an accounting error – in particular a "confusing internal account” that made it seem to him that FTX was on more solid footing. Plus, as Michael Lewis noted in the hagiography “Going Infinite,” SBF privately estimated his personal worth at over $100 billion, though that was before the price of FTT, SOL and other “Sam Coins” cratered. It was actually this insistence that he could have rescued FTX had he not declared bankruptcy, and unwillingness to take responsibility for his crime, that led to his lengthy sentence. “In 30 years, I’ve never seen a performance like that,” Judge Lewis Kaplan said during the sentencing hearing, describing SBF’s evasiveness and remorselessness. But just because someone believes something doesn’t make it true, no matter how many Substack posts they write or spreadsheets they create. John J. Ray III, current FTX CEO overseeing the bankruptcy, says over the past 17 months the firm was able to recover between $14.5 billion and $16.3 billion in assets that weren’t on the exchange at the time it collapsed. While it will likely take access to documents that aren’t actually publicly available, including FTX’s (abysmal) financial statements before the collapse and for today to conclusively prove this; it’s likely this recovery is due mostly to the rising price of crypto assets. Although JJR’s well-paid legal team likely put in a lot of effort to recover funds from “dozens of private entities,” it likely doesn’t add up to billions and billions of dollars. See also: The Downfall of FTX: The Crypto Industry Reacts Anthropic, for instance, one of SBF’s lucky bets in AI, got the firm a return of $884 million – a windfall, but likely the biggest non-crypto sale FTX made. FTX also sold off 38 Bahamian properties for around $199 million, and was able to recover nearly $2.6 billion in cash. In comparison, the estate sold off $1.9 billion worth of deeply discounted SOL recently, and apparently still holds $7.5 billion worth of locked-up tokens. Those tokens were worth less than $500 million at the time of FTX’s collapse. In total, FTX raised about $5 billion by selling tokens, and it expects to raise another $4.4 billion over the next few months. This to me all seems like FTX wasn’t actually solvent at the time it collapsed and that it could repay the $8 billion in missing customer funds if only SBF had the ability to quickly sell off all of its property, equity investments and crypto (without tanking prices even further). But instead due to the subsequent bull run, FTX became solvent. Customers are being made whole, not in crypto assets, of which there is still a shortfall (i.e. there is not enough BTC to go around to pay back all customer BTC claims), but in the dollar value of their accounts in November 2022 prices. It’s a lucky break that the market rebounded enough so that the fraction pays for the whole. But SBF didn’t have the benefit of waiting several months to see if crypto would rise from the ashes. And his argument that FTX only had an illiquidity problem is patently absurd. Edited by Benjamin Schiller.

With a focus on integrating Real World Assets (RWA) and leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI), Eguienta’s work promises to usher in a new era for decentralized finance. Claude Eguienta is the Chief Executive Officer at Mimo, leading the charge in creating protocols that provide tokenized real-world assets and enabling the minting of multiple price-stable currencies against collateral. Previously, Claude co-founded Telcoin, a startup focused on financial inclusion through blockchain-based remittances. Claude opens the discussion by reflecting on the trajectory of RWAs within the decentralize finance ecosystem. Initially, there was a surge of enthusiasm as platforms like Ondo Finance introduced novel protocols, signaling a new edge for RWA in DeFi. However, he notes the momentum seemed to have plateaued, revealing a landscape where the vast potential of RWAs remains largely untapped due to various market readiness and regulatory challenges. «RWA is a story that has been trying to happen for a long time. The biggest kick happened when Ondo announced tokenized T-bills in January: Centrifuge came earlier, but I guess they came at the moment when the market wasn’t ready to listen about those things. It seemed pretty huge from a crypto bubble perspective and attracted a lot of attention. But if you take a couple of big players out of the equation and look at the open protocols that have some traction from users other than their respective founding teams, it really plateaued». Despite these obstacles, Eguienta’s perspective on tokenized real world assets is far from pessimistic. He recognizes the plateau as a phase rather than a permanent state, suggesting that the DeFi community is on the brink of more sophisticated RWA integration strategies. Moving beyond conventional assets, the company is exploring the tokenization of Bitcoin mining operations and AI data centers. For instance, the complexity of Bitcoin mining deterred many despite their interest. Tokenizing the operations demystifies the process. The same goes for AI: the traditional route through brokers, often leading to a suggestion to invest in companies like NVIDIA, felt inadequate for those seeking direct exposure to AI’s financial benefits. Recognizing this gap, Mimo Capital aimed to serve as a bridge, transforming from an alternative option into a pivotal enabler within the economic ecosystem. This shift is not just about diversifying offerings but about aligning with the inherent risk-reward profiles that attract the crypto community. «The whole goal of a lot of the stablecoins that were representing RWA, like the ones that we came up with, USK and others, was to provide the convenience of a stablecoin and the yield of reward asset placement. But it just didn’t materialize this way in the heads of users because the convenience of stablecoins’ liquidity was never matched by any RWA asset, at least just not yet. We examined the state of RWA and recognized a disconnect, realizing that users in the crypto world were not really looking forward to going through the hoops of KYC and all that for a 5% yield. And the safety brought by RWA was not really speaking to the crowds. Users willing to go through all this would rather register at a centralized exchange and go for multiples instead of single-digit percentage gains. Now we’re looking at much higher yields, riskier investments which match what crypto enthusiasts are truly seeking». One of the most intriguing aspects of Eguienta’s vision for DeFi’s future is the role of AI. From enhancing security protocols and user interfaces to enabling more sophisticated financial modeling, AI’s potential to revolutionize DeFi is immense. Eguienta shares examples of how AI can provide users with decision-making support, streamline audits, and offer protection against scams. «I didn’t personally try these products, but Bunzz tries to help with smart contract audits, and Next Gem AI tries to help with users’ decision-making processes regarding safety. It’s clear that these products are young, but they clearly show the industry’s willingness to integrate AI». Mimo Capital is integrating Artificial Intelligence at several levels, reflecting a comprehensive strategy to leverage AI for internal efficiency and product development. The company has purchased specialized AI hardware, a decision driven by Claude’s long-standing engagement in AI research and its proven benefits within Mimo’s operations. Recognizing the demand for AI across various industries, Mimo identified a unique opportunity. Many companies, from automotive manufacturers to tech startups, seek to incorporate AI. This demand has led to a significant supply shock in the AI hardware market, particularly for high-end NVIDIA chips necessary for training AI models efficiently. Mimo’s strategic acquisition of these scarce resources allows it to offer them for lease, creating a new yield-generating product in AI hardware leasing. Anticipating a more integrated platform to showcase these offerings, Mimo developed a proprietary wallet. This wallet is designed to simplify user interaction with DeFi investments, offering an easy way to manage portfolios across various blockchain networks. It aims to be a non-custodial, open-source solution supporting a wider range of protocols beyond Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible chains. «We were like, well, this could be a very nice yielding product. And then we started to think about where we were going to sell this. The first thing that came to our minds was KUMA, our main RWA platform. But we were also thinking about a broader product that deserves a better place to sell. So we decided to come up with a wallet where it would be easier to onboard, view your DeFi positions and anything where you can go and get yield. As we were building this wallet, we realized it would be a nice thing to let people onboard on multiple chains, a non-custodial wallet, open source, something that the industry should have been building for a long time, but we just didn’t see any good open source wallet come that supports anything else than EVM». This ambition led to developing a new wallet, not just as a repository for digital assets but as a platform to explore the intersection of AI and finance. During the development process, an innovative idea emerged: embedding an AI assistant designed to offer users personalized financial guidance, capable of analyzing their DeFi positions and market conditions and suggesting actionable strategies. Integrating AI directly into the wallet transforms it from a tool for transaction management into an interactive advisor capable of executing recommendations with a single click. As an experiment, this initiative is approached with seriousness and an openness to learning. It represents a dual effort to enhance the crypto ecosystem: providing AI-driven yields while improving user experience through direct AI assistance. The journey towards mainstream adoption is fraught with challenges, particularly in the regulatory domain. Achieving regulation in one jurisdiction can offer a competitive edge, yet understanding how to operate globally under local regulations remains complex. Beyond tokenizing traditional assets, venturing into more intricate areas introduces additional regulatory complexities. Projects aiming to tokenize tangible, real-world assets must navigate these regulatory waters while building trust in their platforms. «In case you want to go with something a little bit more complex than just T-bills, you add a degree of from a regulatory standpoint. Because you want to tokenize real things and not necessarily like assets that are already trading somewhere with a regulated custody framework. So you can’t use the banking infrastructure as a backbone. You have to essentially recreate some infrastructure to let you tokenize things properly and make people understand that they can trust it. So you need your auditors to understand that this AI data center that you are using as collateral is going to be safe. You need to do the same for your Bitcoin mines in our case. It’s pretty complex, to say the least». Some regulatory bodies might respond by outright banning such activities, aligning with their stance against cryptocurrencies. Others might create regulatory frameworks or adopt a sandbox approach, allowing entities to operate under a provisional status while monitoring outcomes. «This method has been explored in Singapore, and several other Asian countries and it has proven quite effective. In contrast, the regulatory environment in the United States takes a markedly different approach. Entities are left to determine whether their operations classify as securities, with the understanding that regulatory bodies might intervene if deemed necessary. This uncertain terrain poses significant challenges for industry participants, making the U.S. a particularly complex jurisdiction for RWA space operations, aside from regions where cryptocurrencies face outright bans. Europe, however, has shown a more progressive stance. The European regulatory landscape has been notably clear and forward-thinking». For instance, Mimo received a license to tokenize assets, indicating a progressive stance by European regulators. Interestingly, European regulators, including the Financial Market Authority (FMA) in Liechtenstein, are reconsidering their regulatory framework to align with new Europe-wide regulations on cryptocurrencies, which do not categorically require the tokenization of real-world assets to be regulated. This could mean that activities previously under regulatory scrutiny might transition to being unregulated — not in the sense of being prohibited but rather not specifically monitored by regulatory authorities. «The main challenge is to understand what happens and where. Once you get regulated somewhere, what exactly can you do? How well can you operate globally using your local regulation? Navigating this type of framework has been somewhat challenging, but this is the name of the game». Eguienta is optimistic about the intersection of DeFi, RWAs, and AI. He highlights the development within the DeFi sector tends to be driven by momentum, focusing on trending topics and investor interests rather than addressing underlying issues or leveraging technology’s full potential. The industry’s heavy reliance on venture capital influences, prioritizing projects that mirror existing successes with the allure of new governance tokens backed by notable VCs, exemplifies a cycle of imitation over innovation. Such strategies often need more of the essence of true innovation, serving more as a testament to the industry’s current limitations than its capabilities. The change toward reducing the costs associated with developing novel DeFi solutions could enable more substantial innovation. Making auditing more accessible, simplifying the development process, and lowering entry barriers for developers, especially those equipped with AI tools, could create a more inventive ecosystem. The complexities that genuine DeFi initiatives face pose significant barriers to entry, sharply contrasting with the rapid development cycles typical of the traditional Web2 startup environment. «The future of DeFi hinges on our ability to innovate responsibly, educate our users, and operate within a clear regulatory framework. The regulators have done their job. They provided us with regulatory frameworks, so we (as an industry) can’t blame them anymore. The institutions have done their jobs in many countries, and banks are willing to open bank accounts for crypto companies so we can now be established as proper companies. We can’t blame those guys anymore. Now it’s really about us to deliver solutions that people actually care about and problems that people have and want to be solved».

The company, which managed roughly $94 billion in assets as of Sept. 30, continues its bid to cement what WisdomTree CEO Jonathan Steinberg reiterated to be the firm’s “first-mover status” in tokenization. It launched WisdomTree Prime in July and expanded the app’s reach to residents in 11 additional states earlier this month. The app offers access to nine digital funds — with share ownership records kept on the Stellar or Ethereum blockchains — as well as dollar and gold tokens, bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH). Steinberg said during the company’s earnings Friday that the firm plans to add a money market fund to WisdomTree Prime. It also plans to offer three WisdomTree Siegel-branded digital funds “where customers can deploy a model-like experience with just one click.” Read more: WisdomTree extends reach of Prime app, plots new features Jeremy Siegel, a finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania, partnered with WisdomTree in 2020 to offer the Siegel-WisdomTree Longevity and Siegel-WisdomTree Global Equity model portfolios. Funds employing those two strategies, as well as a WisdomTree Siegel Moderate Digital Fund, will be added to WisdomTree Prime this quarter, a spokesperson told Blockworks. The firm has said it intends to add additional features, such as debit card connectivity and peer-to-peer functionality, in the coming quarters. “Every additional state added, or feature enhancement or product launched has generated interest in what WisdomTree is doing from larger players in the financial and technology industries,” Steinberg said.

The firm added another 3,000 Bitcoin (BTC) to its portfolio, investing roughly $155 million at an average acquisition cost of $51,813 per BTC in this latest purchase. Under Saylor’s guidance, the company’s total Bitcoin assets now stand at 193,000 units, positioning it as a major holder of the cryptocurrency. Originally acquiring BTC at an average rate of $31,544, MicroStrategy has invested about $6 billion in its cryptocurrency assets, which are now valued at nearly $10 billion at current market rates. This positions the company with over $4 billion in profit from its Bitcoin investments, making it one of the largest corporate owners of BTC globally. Since 2020, in response to inflation and the economic uncertainties brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, MicroStrategy has pursued Bitcoin acquisitions. Saylor advocated for Bitcoin as a strategic hedge against the depreciation of the U.S. dollar. The company has financed its Bitcoin acquisitions through a mix of cash reserves, debt issuance, and equity sales. Saylor’s Strategy on Bitcoin Saylor champions Bitcoin as the preeminent cryptocurrency, citing its design which ensures a favorable supply-demand balance for investors. He argues that Bitcoin’s demand far exceeds its supply, a situation made permanent by the finite limit of 21 million BTC that will ever be available, coupled with the halving events every four years that reduce mining rewards and ensure its scarcity. This system was devised by the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. Saylor also points to the approval of spot BTC Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a supportive mechanism for Bitcoin’s model. These ETFs have enabled significant capital inflow into Bitcoin, giving Wall Street investors access to BTC exposure through an exchange-traded fund structure. Since their launch on January 11, spot BTC ETFs have accumulated over $15 billion in assets under management (AUM), supported by more than 250,000 BTC. Saylor has made it clear that his company has no intention of liquidating its cryptocurrency assets, with plans to continue increasing its Bitcoin holdings. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

248::https://cryptobriefing.com/tether-deutschebank-solvency-response/::Crypto Briefing::article::Tether refutes Deutsche Bank research revealing stablecoin solvency risks::Tether said that Deutsche Bank's analysis "lacks clarity and substantial evidence" and led to vague assertions.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Deutsche Bank research analysts have released a report suggesting that most stablecoins, including Tether, are likely to fail due to a lack of transparency and vulnerability to speculative sentiment. The report, which studied 334 currency pegs since 1800, found that only 14% have survived, with a median lifespan of 8-10 years for those that failed or were discontinued. The analysts expressed particular concern about Tether, citing its “monopoly in the stablecoin market that has been filled with speculation and lack of transparency.” They also pointed to Tether’s alleged history of misleading claims on reserve holdings, which led to $41 million in fines by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and the reliance on Tether in the crypto derivatives market, which could magnify losses and blow up levered trades. In response, Tether criticized the Deutsche Bank report, stating that it “lacks clarity and substantial evidence, relying on vague assertions rather than rigorous analysis.” The stablecoin firm argued that the report failed to provide concrete data to support its claims and that the comparison to the collapsed algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD was misleading and irrelevant to the discussion on reserve-backed coins. Tether also questioned the credibility of Deutsche Bank, citing the bank’s own history of fines and penalties. The firm has released several financial attestations suggesting that it holds over $110 billion in fiat-denominated reserves, although critics argue that these attestations do not count as actual financial audits. Despite the ongoing debate surrounding Tether’s transparency and the broader risks associated with stablecoins, some industry leaders, such as Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick, have expressed confidence in Tether’s reserves.

249::https://theconversation.com/why-bitcoin-fraud-suspect-alexander-vinnik-looks-set-to-be-extradited-to-the-us-89054::The Conversation::article::Why bitcoin fraud suspect Alexander Vinnik looks set to be extradited to the US::Allegations bring to the fore questions over the legitimacy of bitcoin – a sound investment tool or a massive scam?::Everyone is going crazy about bitcoin, yet very few people understand what it is, how it relates to blockchain and whether this is a legitimate investment tool or a massive scam. The extradition case of Alexander Vinnik – the alleged Russian mastermind of a US$4 billion digital money laundering scheme – brings all this to the fore. Vinnik, who was arrested in northern Greece, describes himself as a bitcoin consultant and denies all charges brought against him by US officials who have accused him of running the BTC-e exchange and laundering billions of dollars via bitcoin transactions. He had been waiting for Greece’s Supreme Court to decide whether he could be extradited to the US, where he faces a cybercrime trial. On Wednesday, the court ruled that Vinnik can be extradited to face charges in the US. It’s now up to the Greek justice minister to determine whether the extradition will take place – but it is likely Vinnik will be facing US authorities before long. Vinnik, 38, is one of seven Russian suspects arrested or indicted worldwide this year on US cybercrime charges. He has fought hard against extradition to the US, deploying an expensive team of Greek criminal attorneys before the court. Vinnik has said he is willing to be extradited to his home country of Russia, where he is sought on lesser fraud charges. If the Greek justice minister decides to send Vinnik to Russia instead it will be a diplomatic issue between Greece and the US. Some might bristle at the idea of getting involved in bitcoin, given the Vinnik allegations and other not-so-pretty news stories around the bubbling cryptocurrency that is waiting to burst. But you might still be wondering how it works, and whether you can make some money out of it. A good starting point is to reflect briefly on the value of money. What do you understand by value? Take this year’s must-have Christmas toy – a programmable robot made of little bricks. Your kids want one, you want one, it is in short supply and out of stock pretty much everywhere. Its price is climbing outside standard toy stores. You can buy it for multiples of its retail price on online auction sites. This is a valuable commodity. Perhaps one you could invest in. If you can obtain some of these scarce items at normal price, you could make a killing auctioning them online. Now consider this, what if the toy wasn’t a physical item? What if the sought after product was a game app? You can download it, but you need an activation code to use it, and codes aren’t easy to come about. Scarcity would be due to rationing in supply, not due to physical lack of stock. Assuming you could buy multiple activation codes and auction them online, you could treat these as an investment. Never mind for a second who makes the app and why there are limited activation codes. It is considered a valuable asset. Could it be a commodity, a source of value, a store of such value? Could it be used as currency? Substitute the toy robot or app with bitcoin and you get an idea of what is happening. Bitcoin is a type of software. Think of it as a digital token that can be programmed to do various things, containing a variety of information. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are based on blockchain technology, an information storage system which works as a decentralised ledger. Information is not held on a central server, but is duplicated and dispersed across a huge network. Every time this information is updated, a corresponding change is made across the network. What is the benefit of this decentralisation? Blockchain enthusiasts will tell you that the system is impossible to corrupt or manipulate. Any attempt to “hack” information will be rejected by other nodes in the system that hold the true copy of the information. If you have been awarded a digital token, a bitcoin, you can be sure (we are told) that it is genuine. Great, so we have a supposedly impenetrable digital ledger that evidences little bits of software that people think are valuable. Sounds benign, so why is Vinnik facing allegations of money laundering? Law enforcement officers have realised that the decentralised nature of the ledger and the anonymous nature of the originators and holders of bitcoin potentially make it a wonderful conduit for illegally obtained funds. Remember, the ledger is currently beyond the control, or knowledge of governments and state authorities. Rightly or wrongly, bitcoins are considered valuable and people exchange them for real money. The value of bitcoin has well exceeded US$10,000 and financial firms are set to start trading futures – which are bets on the price of upcoming contracts to exchange bitcoin. Blockchain could be a revolution not only in finance, but also in money laundering. But the era of cowboy cryptocurrency trading is set to come to a grinding halt. Regulators worldwide are reacting to soaring values with attempts to inject a degree of transparency in these trades. Starting with the EU, legislation is planned to force online platforms where bitcoins are traded to carry out due diligence on customers and report suspicious transactions. It will bring trades within the network of rules that try to prevent money laundering and dealing in proceeds of crime, including terrorist financing. If you are thinking of speculating on bitcoin, should you do it? Before you make up your mind, remember this: the last innovation in finance promising incredible rewards with appropriately apportioned risks was the creation of synthetic CDOs and derivative-laden layercakes in the mid noughties. And we all know how that went.::2017-12-13T13:00:56Z::Bitcoin, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, Cybercrime::Ioannis Glinavos::Home::https://images.theconversation.com/files/198990/original/file-20171213-27555-24d1xp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
250::https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/05/10/shouldnt-all-these-crypto-lawyers-start-learning-about-crypto/::CoinDesk::article::Shouldn't All These Crypto Lawyers Start Learning About Crypto?::The industry should expect its legal experts to effectively articulate how these innovative technologies are driving changes in how we understand money, privacy and governance.::Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates. Justin Wales is the head of legal for the Americas at Crypto.com. He is the author of "The Crypto Legal Handbook: A Guide to the Laws of Crypto, Web3, and the Decentralized World" (available at www.thecryptolegalhandbook.com). The question seems almost rhetorical: Should lawyers deeply engaged in the cryptocurrency or digital asset industry understand the technologies they are paid to represent before regulators and courts? Surprisingly, many legal professionals, including those actively tasked with navigating existential threats to the cryptocurrency industry or their crypto-wielding clients, treat cryptocurrency more as a novel curiosity than a transformative technology that requires intricate understanding and thoughtful consideration. I've listened to presentations by highly sought-after attorneys with large “crypto practices” who charge thousands of dollars for an hour of their time and joke that they are "not a crypto person" when pressed on a question about the uses of the technology during formal proceedings. They treat the practicalities of using digital assets as an irrelevant afterthought that only complicates their other arguments. This detachment between the industry and its advocates is not merely unhelpful – —it's harmful. The industry tasks its lawyers with representing its interests before courts and regulators, who often need to consider the complex interplay of crypto applications and existing regulations for the first time. If these advocates are unwilling to engage seriously with what the industry is building, how can they effectively persuade a court or regulator that their legal interpretation aligns with the realities of the technology or convey the philosophical foundations upon which the broader cryptocurrency space is built? Top law firms charge thousands of dollars per hour for their services, yet too often, the senior-most partners on a case treat engaging deeply with their client’s crypto business as beneath them. This attitude forces clients to rely on the hope that some crypto-native associate will step in to prevent egregious errors or inefficiencies caused by the lack of interest from those at the top. This dynamic is inefficient and can be financially and strategically costly for those navigating the complicated regulatory challenges inherent to most projects in the space. Fortunately, as crypto-native associates become more senior, the dynamics within law firms are beginning to change. Truly adept "crypto lawyers" have emerged at many prestigious law firms, and there are lawyers at specialized boutiques who certainly know their stuff, but this phenomenon remains surprisingly rare. This shift is crucial, as lawyers who understand and can innovate within the framework of cryptocurrency law are critical for the industry's future. A cynical response might equate demanding that a lawyer representing a crypto company have meaningful experience using cryptocurrencies to a tobacco company requiring that their lawyer smoke. But such glib comparisons reveal a misunderstanding of what cryptocurrency represents – —a potential paradigm shift in how we structure society and handle value, privacy, and trust that relies on first-of-its-kind technologies to further goals that were, until recently, confined to science fiction. Lawyers are free to spend their time as they see fit, but those who believe they can coast on a superficial understanding of Bitcoin that hasn’t been expanded since 2017 and an attitude that "everything old is new again" will find their pool of clients diminishing as the industry progresses and demands more from them. I’m not suggesting that a lawyer needs a computer science degree to be a successful advocate or that they must be a “degen” with their personal finances, but they should put in enough time learning about the industry and interacting with the different projects and protocols that make up the space so that they can speak authoritatively on what their clients do, how they do it, and why it matters. Passion is a valuable asset for any professional, particularly in an industry that evolves as rapidly as cryptocurrency does. Lawyers wishing to stay up-to-speed with the continuous legal and technological changes that are characteristic of the cryptocurrency space must engage in continuous self-study – —a task that is incredibly difficult without a genuine interest in the subject matter. This isn't just about maintaining relevance; it's about providing the best possible representation for clients who rely on their attorneys to understand not just the law but the essence of the technology they are dealing with to ensure their advocacy considers a comprehensive understanding of the facts, rules, and circumstances at play. See also: Fatemeh Fannizadeh on Crypto Law, Switzerland and How KYC Is Failing I get asked all the time by young lawyers or law students what they can do to start a career in crypto law. My advice is always to start using crypto and to see if they believe that technologies that permit people to interact without intermediaries are important and should be protected. If so, start reading about the industry’s history, and if you are still convinced this is a good thing for the world, develop expertise in the various areas of law and financial regulations that impact the field. On the other side, I get asked by non-lawyer entrepreneurs or developers what they can do to ensure their relationship with their lawyers is successful. My answer is to make sure your lawyer understands what you’re trying to build and why and to learn enough about the rules regulating your business so that you can have critical conversations with your legal team about their understanding of the law and their strategy. During conversations with young lawyers or entrepreneurs, I would be asked where they should start developing these informational skills, but I didn’t have a great answer. I put together a resource called “The Crypto Legal Handbook” to address this gap and serve as a primer on cryptocurrency's technological and historical aspects, as well as a comprehensive overview of the various laws that govern the field. The text is designed to, on the one hand, spur lawyers to engage with the crypto world actively, enhancing their ability to serve as true advocates for technological advancement and, on the other hand, to provide entrepreneurs with the tools they need to understand the state of crypto regulations. I believe that most of us working in the crypto industry understand that it is more than just a niche asset class within the financial sector. The proliferation of technologies that allow for a variety of peer-to-peer financial and non-financial communications is a pioneering movement capable of reshaping our understanding of money, privacy, and governance that could substantially impact how we govern our economy and society at large. Isn’t it time we started demanding all these so-called “crypto lawyers” be able to effectively articulate this vision for the future?

251::https://beincrypto.com/token2049-insights-experts/::BeInCrypto::article::Global Web3 Titans Gather at TOKEN2049: Key Insights From Experts::TOKEN2049 is one of the most prestigious Web3 events organized annually in Singapore and Dubai. Gain insights from the event in this article!::We use cookies to improve your experience. TOKEN2049 is one of the most prestigious Web3 events organized annually in Singapore and Dubai, both countries known for being blockchain-friendly. The event gathers executives and founders from leading Web3 companies, where they share views on the industry and give updates about their particular projects. This allows Web3 enthusiasts to become aware of the recent global developments and widen their perspective on the entire ecosystem. The latest TOKEN2049 event in Dubai saw more than 20,000 attendees and over 300 speakers. The event also attracted over 5,000 Web3 companies. Despite Dubai recording the heaviest rainfall in 75 years, the TOKEN2049 team and their co-founder Alex Fiskum made the event possible. The event’s biggest highlight came from Telegram as their CEO and founder, Pavel Durov, and Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, revealed on stage that $USDt and $XAUt launch in the TON and Telegram ecosystem. During the discussion, Pavel highlighted the importance of blockchain technology for Telegram because it allows developers to build apps Telegram Mini Apps. Telegram Mini Apps are apps integrated directly into Telegram, allowing the user to interact with them without ever leaving the popular messenger platform.. In fact, as per Pavel, this is one of the reasons why Telegram has adopted blockchain technology at such a deep level: it helps with the values of the platform by giving power to the people and enriching our ecosystem. The result of this is already visible because out of 900 million active users of Telegram, 360 million of them already interact with these mini-apps every day, and the number is expected to grow. While talking to the audience, Pavel highlighted the importance of blockchain technology when it comes to supporting Telegram’s creator program, in which Telegram shares 70% of ad revenue with creators. This is one of the most generous revenue-sharing models in the history of social media. Pavel talked about the importance of remaining transparent with the users, which is not the case with other social media platforms. He highlighted how Telegram’s algorithms are designed to support creators and help them reach out to their target audience. Something unique in its kind because other platforms use shadowbans when their narrative is not shared. Furthermore, Pavel stated that utilizing Toncoin for payments is the best way possible as it comes with the ease of withdrawals and transfers to creators who are present in different parts of the world. With the help of the creator’s program, Telegram’s goal is to is to create is create a true internet of ownership and reward users for their creativity. Another thing Pavel talked about while addressing the audience was how Telegram utilized blockchain technology by tokenizing usernames and launching “anonymous number NFTs.” With the initiative of Telegram, it was the first time that users could “own” their usernames and do whatever they would like, which generally includes selling their usernames to other users. In fact, users who bid their usernames got 95% of the revenue, and combined with Telegram’s anonymous number of NFTs, $350 million was generated in sales. Moving forward, Pavel stated that Telegram will offer a lot more NFTs that will have some form of real-life value because there is so much that the world can do with NFTs that has not been discovered yet. Telegram will unleash a new era of non-fungible tokens by giving millions of users easy access to NFTs. Similar to Tether, RedStone is also collaborating with The Open Network. The collaboration is extremely exciting for the entire ecosystem as RedStone is the only Oracle that supports Decentralized Finance’s expansion on the TON blockchain. This will give room for more DeFi development on Telegram. Currently, RedStone secures almost $2 billion in assets on-chain and has ample scalability to grow this number. The announcement did not come from Marcin but rather from Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, who ensures the partnership is well underway. While moderating a panel on Liquid Staking and Re-Staking, Marcin and other founders made three notable announcements. The first announcement was made by Mike, the CEO of EtherFi. EtherFi is a renowned liquid re-staking on Ethereum. During the talk, Mike confirmed EtherFi’s focus on EigenLayer expansion, with also a door open to launching on the new re-staking platforms. During the discussion, the second announcement was made by Brian, who is the CEO of Chorus One. Chorus One is a renowned staking solution that works on more than 50 decentralized networks. Brian talked about the complexity of node operation with versatile Actively Validated Services (AVS) while also reassuring that Chorus will use its 6-year-long experience to navigate the space. Lastly, Marcin made the third announcement, in which he confirmed rumors about RedStone’s $500 million deal with EtherFi. The deal will allow RedStone to provide what it does best, which is to help EtherFi validate Oracle data on AVS. Marcin stated that the timeline of the deal will depend on the rollout of M2 (withdrawals) and M3 (slashing) on EigenLayer. However, the work will be completed somewhere around Q3 to Q4 of 2024 for the entire mainnet implementation. During the presentation, Ardiono talked about the reasons behind the growth Tether has achieved so far and where it plans to go in the coming years. The first reason behind Tether’s growth is its’ secure network, which is amongst the best. The security ensures that the Tether will remain pegged to the US dollar, and its value will not decrease in the coming years. Tether has an excess equity of $6 billion and is over-collateralized by 106%. Furthermore, Tether holds $90 billion in US t-bills, more than Australia and Spain. All of these things ensure stability and, therefore, are the reasons behind the growth of Tether. Secondly, Tether has a perfect market fit. Unlike banks, they welcome people with as much money as they have, which is ideal for economies that have high inflation and do not have a large capital to get started. Another thing Ardiono talked about was Tether’s upcoming integration with The Open Network. This is a big step forward for Tether because it will give easy access to hundreds of millions of users on Telegram. Utilizing TON will result in low fees, so Tether has decided on a fixed fee that will be under 15 cents. There will be no traffic-based fluctuations as it will be scalable for billions of users. Ardiono stressed that they chose Telegram because of the ecosystem that Telegram built, which is one of a kind. It already has a massive community and is ready to welcome even more users. Additionally, as other companies are utilizing banks and fiat to support their creators, this system is not scalable, nor is it empowering, as banks can withhold payments whenever they want to. This can be resolved by utilizing Tether, making it a truly win-win deal for the two. The goal is to give users a safe and instant way to send or receive money. Additionally, with this latest partnership, there is a great chance for growth for both companies. As TOKEN2049 concludes, the insights from industry pioneers like Pavel Durov and Paolo Ardoino highlight a transformative future for Web3 and a high potential for mass adoption. Their groundbreaking work with TON, Telegram and Tether is paving the way for a more decentralized and user-centric digital ecosystem. The successful integration of $USDt and $XAUt into the TON framework promises enhancedliquidity for the TON Ecosystem, marking a significant advance in Web3 user onboarding and creators’ economy.

252::https://blockworks.co/news/zk-decentralized-identity-verification::Blockworks::article::Aleo blockchain adds zPass, a ZK protocol for verifying identities ::zPass is based on a research paper on “zk-creds” designed to use zero knowledge proofs for age verification.::zPass is based on a research paper on “zk-creds” designed to use zero knowledge for age verification nuruddean/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks A protocol designed to use zero knowledge cryptography to verify identities has landed on the Aleo blockchain, a zero knowledge privacy (ZKP) network. The protocol, called zPass, enables users to upload identity documents offline to privacy servers and share anonymous “proofs” to organizations. As a result, these companies do not need to store this data themselves. Users who generate their own proofs can then determine exactly who they share their information with and just how much personal data they wish to reveal. Alex Pruden, Aleo’s CEO, told Blockworks in an interview that zPass represents the implementation of a research paper into zk-creds. “The idea of zk-creds was to take a US passport, create a digital record from it, then use that record for age verification purposes,” Pruden said. Pruden explained that on zPass, a two-step process helps ensure that individual identities are safely verified. First, the issuance of the record on-chain is based on the existence of a physical record, and then it is the ability for each individual to control their own privacy keys which generate the proof of identity. Read more: Mastering decentralized identity: The pillar of Web3 “The key piece of what zk-creds and zPass does is to issue the identity, and the identity is the document based on a real-world physical document,” he said. John Reynolds, a product manager for Aleo, noted that existing zk identity systems either rely on centralized proving schemes, or are decentralized but not private. “A lot of zk identity systems use a centralized proving system or have centralized sequencers — we have a leveraged tailored [layer-1], we have the ability for users themselves to act as provers, they can generate proofs, send those proofs to Aleo, decentralized validators can validate those proofs, and the Aleo blockchain will not push all of this overhead verification to third party systems,” Reynolds told Blockworks in an interview. On the note of decentralized identity solutions, Reynolds said that because they are not private and information is publicly available on a database, users can be tracked. “They may not be able to see all your information, but they can see who you’re sharing it with and how often you’re sharing it with them, and can target you as a result of that,” he said. At launch, zPass will focus primarily on providing zk age verification and creating child-safe spaces online, Reynolds said. “We want to create a space that supports children and avoids them from being exposed to potential predators or [predatory] content,” he said. “So our main goal [for now] is to lean into age verification.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

Bitcoin, trading under the symbol BTC, saw its price drop to $42,540. This downturn occurred in response to the Federal Open Market Committee’s announcement on January 31st. The Committee, during their press conference, confirmed that interest rates would remain between 5.25% and 5.50%. They emphasized the need for increased confidence in effectively addressing inflationary pressures before considering any rate cuts. Following this announcement, Bitcoin’s price marginally decreased by over 2.2%, trading around $42,590, as reported by TradingView. Despite this dip, Bitcoin has shown a 7% increase over the week. In their statement, the Federal Reserve Board expressed that reducing the target range wouldn’t be advisable until there’s greater assurance that inflation is steadily moving towards the 2% mark. The Federal Reserve acknowledged the robust economic growth, citing continuous job creation and a decline in unemployment rates as signs of economic resilience. However, the Fed maintained a cautious stance, noting that although inflation has softened over the past year, it still remains at a level that doesn’t guarantee rate reductions. “The economic outlook remains uncertain, with the Committee keeping a close watch on inflation risks,” the statement read. Interest rate cuts are generally seen as positive for high-risk assets like cryptocurrencies and technology stocks. When the Fed lowers rates, borrowing becomes more affordable, stimulating spending and risk-taking in the economy. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

254::https://cryptobriefing.com/ftx-repayment-dispute-plan/::Crypto Briefing::article::FTX creditors seek repayments at current market rates::Creditors argue for fair market value in FTX asset repayments.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Bankrupt crypto exchange FTX unveiled yesterday a new plan to pay out at least 118% of recognized claims to 98% of its creditors. However, the plan faces pushback from Sunil Kavuri, who speaks for the largest group of creditors. Kavuri has called for a rejection of the proposed restructuring, arguing that repayments should reflect the current market prices of assets, not their value at the time of FTX’s bankruptcy. FTX Plan Takeaways 1) Sullivan and Cromwell included exculpation clause so they + no one involved sued for misconduct 2) S&C puppet John Ray in charge with no accountability 3) Petition prices + 18% (<$50k; 25% to 47% >$50K) 4) Cheques paid 5) Lose claim if cheques not cashed… — Sunil (FTX Creditor Champion) (@sunil_trades) May 8, 2024 Kavuri said the pricing in the petition for repayment underestimated the actual value of FTX customer holdings. He claimed that the FTX debtors had caused creditors more than $10 billion in losses. The restructuring unit of FTX recovered assets worth between $14.5 and $16.3 billion after a 17-month period, which is more than the exchange’s estimated shortfall of $8 to $10 billion at the time of its collapse. With these recovered funds, the firm asserts it can compensate 98% of FTX’s users. Those with claims of $50,000 or less are slated to receive at least 118% of their asset value within two months of court approval, while the rest are to be paid the full value of their assets plus a 9% interest rate for the holding period. Kavuri also pointed out an ongoing lawsuit against Sullivan & Cromwell (S&C), the law firm handling FTX’s bankruptcy, over their previous relationship with the exchange. He opposes the inclusion of an exculpation clause that protects S&C from lawsuits related to misconduct. The law firm was previously sued by a group of FTX creditors represented by Edwin Garrison. The creditors alleged the firm knowingly provided services or assistance that directly enabled or facilitated FTX’s fraudulent activities. S&C was also selected to oversee Binance following its settlement with the US Department of Justice.

255::https://theconversation.com/bitcoins-surge-intensifies-need-for-global-regulation-of-cryptocurrencies-86893::The Conversation::article::Bitcoin’s surge intensifies need for global regulation of cryptocurrencies::Crypto cash is catnip for criminals and a huge challenge to law enforcement – so it’s time to bring in a tough, jurisdiction-busting regulatory body.::The news that bitcoin had broken the $10,000 barrier reflects the way that mainstream investors have been flocking to cryptocurrencies over the past year. But amid the excitement, regulators are fretting about criminals who are increasingly using cryptocurrencies to escape detection from law enforcement. Why is digital currency so appealing to miscreants? Cryptocurrencies are a recent phenomenon and – as with all new technology – it takes time for regulators to catch up. Bitcoin was the first to gain an international reputation as a digital currency that could be used to settle transactions after it was anonymously created in early 2009. Cryptocurrencies are decentralised, meaning that they are issued without a central administering authority. They are cryptography-based, distributed open source and function on a peer-to-peer basis. Significantly, the underlying protocols on which most cryptocurrencies are based do not require or provide user identification and verification. Also the historical transaction records generated on the blockchain (the technology behind bitcoin, which serves as a public ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions) are not necessarily associated with an individual’s identity. Cryptocurrencies are also – by definition – convertible virtual currencies, as they can be exchanged for fiat money such as pounds, dollars and euros and this facilitates their use for settling commercial transactions. Bitcoin is now an acceptable form of payment in exchange for goods and services by household names such as Microsoft, Expedia and Subway. At the same time, blockchain technology is being adopted by more businesses. Private transactions enabled by the use of bitcoin are key to understanding the growth of cryptocurrencies among consumers. However, this advantage is keeping regulators and law enforcers awake at night. The infamous Silk Road case drives this point home. Bitcoin was used to purchase drugs through the dark web – transactions that weren’t spotted by the authorities. But hard-to-track criminal activity isn’t the only threat from the use of cryptocurrencies – there’s also the possibility of their use to finance terrorism, given that the formal banking sector is now adept at spotting suspicious movement and mobilisation of monies through the banking system The fact that they can be converted into pounds, dollars and euros does make regulation of cryptocurrency more feasible. It can be done at the point of their conversion through virtual currency exchanges – which, as financial institutions, can be regulated. International financial regulation and a growing number of national measures across the globe, such as “Know Your Customer” (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) directed at financial institutions, have been strengthened. And, when implemented effectively, it’s now easier to track down individuals engaging in illegal transactions. But the global nature of this payment mechanism is the biggest challenge. Payments can be easily affected cross-border because conversion of the likes of bitcoin through currency exchanges can be transacted in different parts of the world – including in jurisdictions with lax financial regulatory regimes and weak KYC/AML measures. This means that, while jurisdictions with stronger regulatory powers may clamp down on criminal activities, such efforts can be easily wiped out because perpetrators are likely to migrate to countries with lax regimes. Nonetheless, positive steps are being taken to regulate financial technology (fintech) products such as cryptocurrencies. Emerging challenges within this sector has led to the arrival of regtech – which, among other things, is regulatory technology adopted to address fintech risk issues. Regtech covers artificial intelligence, big data and machine learning – technology that enables detailed data analysis on platforms such as blockchain. Again, regtech is only likely to be adopted effectively in jurisdictions with advanced regulatory regimes, so the extent of its effectiveness in policing the global cryptocurrency phenomenon appears limited. Another challenge is the investigation and prosecution of illegal activities perpetrated with payments using cryptocurrencies, with semi-anonymity of the blockchain making it difficult to monitor transactions and identify suspicious behaviour, such as drug sales. Law enforcement agencies find it incredibly difficult to trace illicit proceeds that are laundered using cryptocurrencies and – once again – are scuppered by different legal systems around the world. Different jurisdictions have their own approaches to regulating cyber-related transactions, which makes international cooperation deeply challenging. In some countries, such as North Korea and China, regulation of web-based transactions is significant for national security policy. Legal mechanisms are in place to allow extensive government intrusion into the sender and recipient details of every single transmission. Other countries, such as the US and the UK, cautiously approach online regulation to balance security concerns against constitutionally protected freedoms and to preserve privacy and data protection laws. It means that a worldwide effort is needed to regulate this global payment mechanism. Governments, financial regulators, financial intelligence units and law enforcement agencies must all agree to a unified approach in tackling cryptocurrencies. Without this, effective regulation of bitcoin and similar currencies is unattainable. A starting point could be instituting minimum regulation, such as currently exists in some international financial standards including the Basle Committee’s Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision and the IOSCO principles of securities regulation. Countries across the world are encouraged to implement these provisions, which indicates that they embrace investor-friendly policies. A similar standard applied to cryptocurrencies would be a sensible way forward, given the patchwork approach to regulating cyber-related transactions around the globe.::2017-11-29T14:49:31Z::Bitcoin, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, Cryptography, Financial regulations, Fintech::Iwa Salami::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/196921/original/file-20171129-29117-1cb8off.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
256::https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/05/09/how-the-us-should-regulate-stablecoins/::CoinDesk::article::How the U.S. Should Regulate Stablecoins::To properly regulate stablecoins in the U.S., look at e-money abroad, says Marcelo Prates, a speaker at Consensus 2024.::In a recent podcast, Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University, painted stablecoins as a dangerous threat to the banking system and, ultimately, to the public at large. In her view, stablecoins could destabilize banks and eventually require a government bailout. Her comments come amid a new push in the U.S. Congress for regulating stablecoins at the federal level. Although the chances of any stablecoin bill being enacted into law in a year of presidential elections are slim, Allen is concerned that these bills are “giving public backing to stablecoins.” For her, “stablecoins serve no important purpose and frankly just should be banned.” Marcelo M. Prates, a speaker at Consensus 2024, is a financial policy and regulation expert writing about money, payments, and digital assets. Are her concerns valid? Only for those who are against competition and don’t like regulatory clarity. What Allen depicts as a scary and useless fad is an upgraded version of one of the most revolutionary financial innovations in the last 25 years: electronic money, or simply e-money, issued by non-banks. In the early-2000s, the European Union decided it was about time for more people to have access to faster and cheaper digital payments. With that in mind, E.U. legislators developed a regulatory framework for e-money and allowed start-ups making the most of technology, the so-called fintech, to provide payment instruments in a regulated and safe way. The idea behind it was simple. As banks are complex institutions providing multiple services and are subject to higher risks and increased regulation, opening a bank account to make digital payments was usually difficult and costly. The solution was to have a separate licensing and regulatory regime for non-banks focused on one service: transforming cash they received from their customers into e-money that could be used for digital payments either through a prepaid card or an electronic device. In practice, e-money issuers work like narrow banks. They are legally required to safeguard or insure the cash they receive from their customers so that e-money balances can always be converted back to cash with no loss of value. As they are licensed and supervised entities, customers know that, aside from gross regulatory failure, their e-money is safe. It's thus easy to see that the vast majority of existing stablecoins, those denominated on a sovereign currency like U.S. dollars, are just e-money with a kick: as they are issued on blockchains, they are not restricted to a national payments system and can circulate globally. Instead of a scary financial product, stablecoins are really “e-money 2.0,” with the potential to keep delivering on the original e-money promises of increasing competition in the financial sector, lowering costs for consumers, and advancing financial inclusion. But for these promises to be fulfilled, stablecoins do need to be properly regulated at the federal level. Without federal law, stablecoin issuers in the U.S. will continue to be subject to state money transmitter laws that aren’t uniformly designed or consistently enforced when it comes to segregation of clients’ funds and integrity of assets kept in reserve. Considering the decades-long experience of the European Union in e-money and improvements brought by other countries, an effective stablecoin regulation should be built around three pillars: granting of a non-bank license, direct access to central-bank accounts, and bankruptcy protection for backing assets. First, it’d be contradictory to restrict stablecoin issuance to banks. The essence of banking is the possibility of holding deposits from the public that aren’t always 100% backed, which is traditionally known as “fractional reserve banking.” And that happens so that banks can make loans without using only their capital. For stablecoin issuers, on the other hand, the goal is that each stablecoin is fully backed with liquid assets. Their sole job is to receive cash, offer a stablecoin in return, hold safely the cash received, and return the cash anytime someone comes with a stablecoin to redeem. Lending money isn’t a part of their business. Stablecoin issuers, much like e-money issuers, are meant to compete with banks in the payments sector, especially in cross-border payments. They’re not supposed to replace banks or, worse, become banks. That’s why stablecoin issuers should be granted a specific non-bank license, as happens for e-money issuers in the E.U., U.K., and Brazil: a simpler license with requirements, including capital requirements, that are proportionate to their limited activity and lower risk profile. They don’t need a banking license, nor should they be required to get one. Second, and to reinforce their lower risk profile, stablecoin issuers should be able to have a central-bank account to hold their backing assets. Transferring the cash received from their customers to a bank account or investing it in short-term securities are typically safe options, but both can become riskier in times of stress. Circle, a U.S. stablecoin issuer, had a hard time when Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) failed, and $3.3 billion of its cash reserves (almost 10% of the total reserves) that had been deposited with SVB were temporarily unavailable. And several banks, including SVB, that were holding U.S. treasuries suffered losses after interest rates rose in 2022, and the treasuries’ market price declined, leaving some of them short on liquidity and unable to face withdrawals. Read more: Dan Kuhn - What Visa’s ‘Organic’ Stablecoin Report Misses To avoid problems in the banking system or the treasuries market spilling over to stablecoins, issuers should be required to deposit their backing reserves directly with the Fed. This rule would effectively eliminate credit risk in the U.S. stablecoin market and enable real-time supervision of stablecoins’ backing — no need for deposit insurance and no bailout risk, just like e-money and contrary to bank deposits. Note that central-bank accounts for non-bank institutions wouldn’t be unprecedented. E-money issuers in countries like the U.K, Switzerland and Brazil can keep users’ funds safeguarded directly with the central bank. Third, customers’ funds should be considered by law segregated from the issuer’s and not subject to any insolvency regime if the stablecoin issuer were to fail — for example, because of the materialization of operational risks, like fraud. With that additional layer of protection, stablecoin users could quickly regain access to their funds during a liquidation process, as general creditors of the bankrupt issuer wouldn’t be able to seize customers’ funds. Again, something like what’s considered the best practice for e-money issuers. In the public debate about stablecoin regulation, alarming takes might impress a distracted audience. But, for those paying attention, balanced arguments based on successful examples and experiences from around the world should prevail. Edited by Benjamin Schiller.

In a recent in-depth interview with BeInCrypto, Chirag Jetani, the Founder & COO of Diamante Blockchain, shared his ambitious vision for advancing blockchain technology across multiple sectors. With a rich background in Web3, Jetani discussed the unique capabilities and strategic positioning of Diamante Blockchain, worldwide. The conversation explored a variety of topics, including the challenges of scalability and speed in blockchain technology and Diamante’s approach to creating a sustainable and efficient ecosystem. Jetani highlighted how Diamante Net, described as a “layer-1, state-of-the-art hybrid blockchain platform,” is aiming to redefine financial transactions with seamless interoperability. At its core, Diamante Network stands distinguished by its layer-1, hybrid blockchain infrastructure, crafted to address some of the most pressing issues faced by traditional blockchains: scalability, speed, and environmental impact. By implementing a Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA), Diamante enhances transaction processing speeds without compromising on security, a critical feature for modern enterprises and financial institutions. This strategic choice in consensus mechanisms allows Diamante to outpace conventional blockchains significantly. “Our latest deployment reduced energy consumption by 40% through optimized consensus algorithms,” Jetani highlights. Furthermore, Diamante’s architecture supports a wide range of applications, from financial services to supply chain management, making it a versatile platform for various industries seeking blockchain solutions. Its strong design ensures that as the network scales, it remains efficient and secure, paving the way for a new standard in blockchain technology. Central to the Diamante ecosystem is the DIAM Coin, a utility token designed to streamline the operations within the Diamante network and enhance user engagement. DIAM Coin serves multiple functions, from facilitating transactions with reduced fees to granting access to exclusive features within the Diamante suite of applications. “DIAM Coin streamlines transactions, facilitating access to premium ecosystem features and driving user engagement,” Jetani explains. DIAM Coin is particularly pivotal in operating Diamante’s flagship applications, such as PayCircle, CreditCircle, MudraCircle, and MetaCircle. For instance, in PayCircle, DIAM is used to handle transaction fees and reward mechnaisim, which broadens its utility and acceptance from across the globe. Moreover, the economic model of DIAM Coin is strategically designed to be deflationary, where a portion of the coins used in transactions is burned, thus reducing the total supply and increasing scarcity. This mechanism supports the coin’s long-term value proposition, aligning with the ecosystem’s growth and sustainability goals. “The strategic integration of DIAM across these platforms significantly propels its utility and engagement,” states Jetani. Diamante Network’s strong ecosystem is powered by a suite of decentralized applications (dApps) that leverage the core capabilities of the blockchain as well as AI to deliver unique solutions across various sectors. At the forefront of these innovations are PayCircle, DiamCircle, MudraCircle, and MetaCircle, each designed to integrate seamlessly with the DIAM Coin, enhancing the blockchain’s utility and user experience. PayCircle serves as a comprehensive financial application and a super app that facilitates blockchain-based transactions, supporting fiat transactions and multi-currency digital assets trading. The app offers AI-curated and customized rewards and cashbacks based on individuals’ and businesses’ transactions. This dApp uses DIAM Coin to efficiently handle transaction fees, with a portion of the coin being burned to enhance network stability and ensure a sustainable supply. Chirag Jetani articulates the broader vision for PayCircle: “We are evolving our platform with our native digital asset, DIAM, broadening its utility as a strong payment method accepted by an expanding network of merchants.” MudraCircle focuses on central bank digital currency (CBDC) solutions, where DIAM Coin plays a crucial role in fee processing, network access, and governance participation. This dApp enhances liquidity and interoperability between various digital currencies, enriching the financial ecosystem and providing users with reduced transaction fees and access to exclusive features. MetaCircle, set in a virtual environment, uses DIAM Coin as the primary currency for purchasing digital assets, such as virtual real estate and exclusive metaverse experiences. Its integration into MetaCircle’s virtual banking features simplifies asset management and financial transactions, making virtual financial services seamless and user-friendly. Jetani notes, “MetaCircle uses DIAM Coin to create a comprehensive virtual economy, where users can engage in transactions as easily as they would in the real world.” These dApps are pivotal in driving growth and engagement within the Diamante Ecosystem, offering increased utility and incentivization through DIAM Coin and fostering a network effect that attracts more users and stakeholders, thereby accelerating ecosystem growth. Diamante Network stands out from other blockchain platforms because it seamlessly combines speed, security, and environmental friendliness. Federated Byzantine Agreements (FBAs) are used for consensus, which guarantees fast transaction speeds and high security without the energy inefficiencies of traditional Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) systems. By using FBAs, this is achieved. Diamante also offers predictive and analytical capabilities that automate complicated processes through the integration of blockchain technology with artificial intelligence (AI). This integration reduces the need for manual intervention and enhances the platforms. It also offers: In addition, Diamante allows for smooth communication with other blockchain networks, which greatly increases the reach and utility of its platforms. Diamante also stands out in an industry that is frequently criticized for its environmental impact thanks to its commitment to sustainability, which is another key component of its strategy. “Our latest initiatives include participating in carbon credit markets and exploring renewable energy sources for our data centers, aiming to achieve a net-zero carbon footprint by 2025,” According to Diamante’s Co-founder & COO, Chirag Jetani. This showcases Diamante’s commitment about being an environmentally responsible business. As Diamante Network sets its sights on global expansion, the eyes are on markets such as the UAE, USA, and India, focusing on sectors ripe for digital transformation through blockchain & AI technologies. “We are poised for aggressive expansion into new markets, focusing on sectors such as digital finance, smart contracts, dApps, gaming, CBDC and more,” Jetani states. A key component of Diamante’s strategy involves understanding and adapting to these regions’ unique cultural, economic, and regulatory landscapes. This involves conducting extensive market research, forging strategic partnerships with local entities, and engaging directly with regulatory bodies to ensure compliance and foster trust. Diamante has been actively involved in various collaborations, forging partnerships with various Web3 projects and crypto events across the globe. With these collaborations, the company is paving the way for a seamless integration of technologies. Diamante’s dynamic community of over one million showcases its strong commitment towards building a robust technology ecosystem, driving the evolution of blockchain, AI and Web3. Through these efforts, Diamante aims to tailor its technology to meet local demands, thereby facilitating smoother entry and stronger adoption. Looking ahead, Diamante is not only expanding geographically but also focusing on the integration of latest technologies, such as AI, IoT, and Metaverse, with its blockchain solutions. The future roadmap includes launching blockchain-based platforms for industries like pharmaceuticals to combat counterfeiting and enhance transparency. “Our future plans are centered around harnessing blockchain and AI to address pressing global challenges in sectors including healthcare, finance, and supply chain management,” Jetani remarks.

258::https://blockworks.co/news/blockchain-security-experts-team::Blockworks::article::Blockchain security experts team up to improve industry threat response::Shield3’s Isaac Patka has been working alongside Paradigms Samczsun to bolster cybersecurity threat responses after hacks.::Shield3’s Isaac Patka has been working alongside Paradigms Samczsun to bolster cybersecurity threat responses after hacks DM7/Shutterstock, modified by Blockworks Since the spring of this year, Isaac Patka of AI security firm Shield3 and Paradigm research partner Sam, better known as Samczsun, have been working alongside blockchain projects to improve security in the wake of cyber threats that have continued to plague the industry. The duo launched SEAL 911 in early August, a Telegram bot designed to connect users with vetted security experts aiming to enhance cybersecurity disclosure and swiftly prevent DeFi hacks potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars. That initiative was established in the hopes of countering multiple industry-related hacks that have taken place this year, including Curve Finance’s $70 million exploit in July. Now the pair are hoping to up the ante, establishing a new emergency drill initiative designed to assist budding blockchain protocols in their fight against malicious hackers and potential attack vectors. Blockworks reached out to Patka to get a better sense of their undertaking and the lessons they have learned over the past few months. Blockworks: Can you walk us through the inception of this emergency drill initiative? What was the driving force behind it? Patka: I first met Sam through our mutual friend Jeanne. I met Jeanne at DWeb camp 2022 when I was presenting some of my previous open source & standards projects. I heard that Sam was looking for some help in building some training infrastructure for protocol teams to practice being in a war room prior to a real emergency. The idea resonated with me because at that time I was working on some research and tools related to identifying and avoiding social attacks and dependency failures in decentralized communities. I volunteered to help get a proof of concept off the ground and after a quick brainstorming call in the spring, I got to work on outlining the drill framework for Compound Labs, which was the first team that offered to participate in a drill. Blockworks: You mentioned the role of “comprehensive recon” in your drills. How does this initial step set the stage for the rest of the exercise? Patka: In the recon phase I get up to speed with all of the features, smart contracts, documents and publicly available information about the target protocol. I’m trying to figure out what the “control surface” is for any privileged users [or] admins, how the protocol interacts with [or] relies on other protocols, how they monitor the health of the system, what risk processes exist, how they introduce things like protocol upgrades or new feature releases, and if there are inconsistencies in the system if it’s deployed across different networks. This recon becomes the foundation for the tabletop scenarios where we talk through potential issues. Blockworks: The use of tabletop simulations seems like an interesting approach. Could you elaborate on what goes into these simulations and how they inform the subsequent steps? Patka: After the recon phase, I put together a script with a few scenarios and talk through them with the whole team on a call. These scenarios help us understand their incident response procedures, their monitoring and their social/ comms style. The questions we’re asking at this point are: All of this helps us find potential “hot spots” or things that we want to stress test in a live scenario. Blockworks: What criteria do you use to select the protocol teams you’re going to drill with? Do you have any prerequisites? Patka: At this phase, we’re trying to work with teams where we think we can both help them by providing some training, but also learn from them about how the top protocol teams in the space operate, and share those practices with the wider community. So while we don’t have specific prerequisites, a good fit now is a team that contributes to a protocol with fairly widespread adoption and has been through a few incidents already so we can learn about a variety of team styles. However, as our infrastructure is becoming more robust and easier to set up, I would enjoy working with some teams earlier on in their protocol to provide some training to people who have never been in a war room before. Blockworks: Your first test was with the Compound protocol. Can you delve into some of the unique challenges or lessons learned from that initial test? Patka: The biggest planning challenge was identifying a scenario that was not too catastrophic to be frustrating, but interesting enough to be engaging and would involve some diagnosis and coordination. We considered a variety of things like external protocol failures, governance attacks and contract upgrade issues. We ended up simulating a bug that made the protocol slowly start losing funds so that we could see how their monitoring would pick up on the process and how they would respond. One of the biggest lessons here was on the social, coordination layer. I was impressed with the close collaboration between the protocol devs and the auditors and protocol guardians in diagnosing the issue. On a technical level, the first drill also involved a lot of late-night debugging infrastructure, getting the network fork, and block explorer, and monitoring infra stability. Blockworks: You talked about avoiding zero-day vulnerabilities in your drills. Can you explain the reasoning behind this decision and how it affects the integrity of the exercise? Patka: The reason we avoid “zero-day” vulnerabilities or other very widespread catastrophes is so that we can engage the protocol team in something they could reasonably respond to, and something contained within their protocol’s ecosystem. For example, we haven’t done drills around things like compiler bugs, or consensus layer failures. However, I think these widespread issues would be interesting to simulate in cross-protocol drills where we could get multiple teams and perhaps users of the protocols all interacting with a forknet where something has gone wrong to make it realistic and build social resiliency. Blockworks: You mentioned Yearn’s “emergency procedure cards” during your test with them. How common is this practice across other protocols, and would you recommend it as a standard? Patka: I haven’t seen other protocols that implement emergency procedure cards like Yearn yet, but I’d highly recommend it. In many protocols, but especially with Yearn, there are many external integrations that require specific context and subject matter expertise. When some incident happens, you don’t want to be spending time re-reading your own docs & contracts instead of taking action. Having emergency procedures for specific scenarios helps teams make decisions quicker and more confidently. Writing these emergency procedures is a mandatory step of the risk [and] diligence process of deploying Yearn strategies. I’d recommend adding emergency procedures to the risk/diligence processes for other protocols, for example when deciding whether or not to integrate with various assets as collateral sources or adding them to markets. Blockworks: What are some key performance indicators you look at during and after a drill to measure its effectiveness? Patka: I look for some indicators of both our performance as organizers of the drill and how well the team did. For our side, I’m looking at the stability of our infrastructure and how well the team adapts to the simulated environment. On the project side, I’m keeping a timeline of at what point issuers are discovered, how long until there is a diagnosis, and how long until there is some consensus around the action to take. We also send out a postmortem survey to teams to find out what they learned, what they plan to improve in their processes, and how we can improve our simulations. Blockworks: Can you share some overarching trends or common gaps you’ve noticed in protocol security as a result of these drills? Patka: I’m not sure if it’s a gap but there seems to be less of a formal “on-call” system across various protocols than I expected. There is an ‘always online’ aspect of the crypto culture where people seem to just assume the right developer or multi-sig signer will be available when needed. This generally seems to work but I’m curious to explore if some more formalization of roles and schedules would help. I’ve also noticed that monitoring and governance varies for protocols across different [layer-1s/layer-2s] where they have code deployed. I think there is room for improvement across the industry on how protocols that straddle multiple networks manage their contracts. Blockworks: Looking ahead, are there plans to broaden these drills to include more protocols or even different types of tests? Patka: For sure, we are looking to broaden drills to include different types of protocols, or perhaps multiple protocols at the same time. We also want to get to the point where these are easy enough to run that teams can hold regular training for community contributors to build their experience in incident response. I’d also love to engage with new security engineers who might want to learn about security by designing scenarios and configuring simulations. This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.

This move is of particular interest amidst Grayscale’s launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF, distinguished by its relatively steep fee of 1.5%. The shift in investor preference is becoming more apparent in the wake of the SEC sanctioning multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs. In this evolving landscape, other ETFs managed by major players like BlackRock, VanEck, ARK 21Shares, and Bitwise are stepping up the competition with more appealing fee structures, varying from 0.2% up to 1.5%. Some of these ETFs are even offering temporary fee waivers to attract investors. The Bitcoin market itself is experiencing significant dynamism. Post the SEC’s endorsement of several Bitcoin spot ETFs, Bitcoin’s value soared to nearly $49,000, only to subsequently plunge to about $41,300, which translates to a sharp 10.5% drop within a day. This price fluctuation can be ascribed to multiple factors, including the market’s reaction to the introduction of new ETFs and potential supply disturbances caused by substantial transactions like that of Grayscale. Earlier, various analysts had pointed out the likelihood of substantial volatility in Bitcoin prices as the market adapts to these new investment mechanisms. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

260::https://cryptobriefing.com/lagrange-crypto-startup-raises-13m-thiel/::Crypto Briefing::article::Lagrange Labs closes $13.2M to build out ZK proofs based on EigenLayer::The startup's flagship product is a zero-knowledge "coprover" slated for release towards the end of this month.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Lagrange Labs, a cryptography startup specializing in zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, has raised $13.2 million in a seed funding round led by Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund. The startup is based on Ethereum’s EigenLayer restaking platform and is aimed at providing decentralized applications with efficient and secure access to otherwise resource-intensive onchain computing power. Lagrange’s flagship product comes in the form of a zero-knowledge “coprover,” slated for release later this month. According to the press materials, the coprover is operates as an offchain network of specialized nodes that could execute intensive computations and generate ZK proofs based on the results. Such a setup allows for decentralized applications to verifiably access the computations without requiring trust between the initiated task and the offchain prover. Founder Ismael Hishon-Rezaizadeh explained that Lagrange’s proving systems and proof constructions can scale to “very big-data scales of verifiable computation” that otherwise would have been “infeasible.” This approach enables blockchains, which are often expensive and sluggish for certain kinds of activities, to run some computations cheaply and quickly off-chain. Lagrange’s security will be based on EigenLayer, a platform on Ethereum that allows users to “restake” ether (ETH) tokens to help secure upstart blockchain apps in exchange for extra rewards. According to Hishon-Rezaizadeh, some $6 billion worth of restaked assets has already been allocated for the security of Lagrange. Lagrange claims that they will be working to continually develop their operators and match improvements from EigenLayer’s core stack. The startup is partnered with Kraken, a crypto exchange, and Galaxy, a crypto-financial firm. Aside from the Founder’s Fund, the recently closed seed round also saw participation from Archetype Ventures, 1kx, Maven11, Volt Capital, Fenbushi Capital, CMT Digital, Mantle, and Ecosystem.

261::https://theconversation.com/four-factors-driving-the-price-of-bitcoin-87244::The Conversation::article::Four factors driving the price of Bitcoin::The price of Bitcoin has declined significantly in the past couple of days, after rising 1,850% in the past two years. Here are four reasons why.::The price of Bitcoin has dropped to around A$8,000 in the last few days, after almost hitting A$10,000 in the past month, and rising over 1,850% since 2015. All of this shows how volatile the currency is, prompting the question, what leads to such huge movements? Our ongoing research reveals four factors that affect the price of Bitcoin. These include media hype and uptake by peers, political uncertainty and risk (such as the election of Donald Trump or the vote for Brexit), moves by governments and regulators, and the governance of Bitcoin itself. It is likely the last factor that has driven the latest drop in the price, as a proposed Bitcoin split (or “fork”) failed to gain support from developers towards the end of last week. The split would have doubled the number of coins in circulation (as previous splits have) and increased transaction speed.  Economists have long had a notion that psychological factors affect investor decisions. This is called “animal spirits” and refers to investors making decisions based on the behaviour of other market participants and their own intuitions, rather than hard analysis. Analysis of the price of Bitcoin shows that positive media coverage is one of the main factors driving the price. Positive media coverage of new technologies causes a well-known hype-cycle – a peak of hype is followed by a “trough of disillusionment”. This was most apparent in the early days of Bitcoin, when mainstream press started to report on the new currency and caused a number of short price spikes and collapses. As media coverage increases and other factors are brought in, it is harder to distil the effect of the media alone. Something similar happens when high-profile companies go public, as investors “pile in” and the value rapidly increases from a low base. Think of a company like Twitter, which saw a huge sharemarket “pop” when it went public. Political risk around national currencies can also affect the price of Bitcoin as people use it to hedge against price movements in a particular currency, or they need to quickly move large amounts of value out a country or currency. The economic crisis in Greece in 2015 was followed by reports of increased buying of Bitcoin by Greek citizens wishing to protect their wealth. This did not seem to affect the price of Bitcoin on global markets, however, which remained steady between A$300 and $400 for most of that year. But nervousness about the national referendum for Britain to leave the European Union (Brexit) on June 23 2016 did lead to an increase in the price of Bitcoin alongside a decrease in the value of the British pound. The pound started plummeting around May 20 2016. By July 25 it was more than 10% below its pre-Brexit value. For the same period the price of Bitcoin increased by over 65% (from £302 to £502). The election of Donald Trump as US president was also followed by two months of steep rises in the price of Bitcoin. Many attributed this to uncertainty in the US economy.  Regulators around the world have had to catch up to the rise of Bitcoin. They must decide, for instance, how it will be treated by the tax system, or whether and what regulation applies to its use. Two events in particular highlight the impact regulations can have on the price. The announcement that Bitcoin would be considered legal tender in Japan pushed the price of Bitcoin up by 2% in just 24 hours, and increased the price globally by 160% for the next two months. China’s decision to shut down several Bitcoin exchanges and ban initial coin offerings (a form of crowdfunding often paid for with cryptocurrencies) sent the price of Bitcoin plummeting by 29% in 24 hours. Although Bitcoin is a decentralised currency, some decisions about how it will work or evolve need to be made from time to time. These also have an impact on the price. The software used to verify Bitcoin transactions is created by developers and is run by miners (the global network people who verify Bitcoin transactions). To change the software used to mine and authenticate transactions developers need more than 50% of the global network of miners to agree with that change. When they get that support they can create a “fork”. On August 1 2017 Bitcoin underwent a “hard fork”. A new cryptocurrency – Bitcoin cash – was created and given to everyone who owned Bitcoin. Bitcoin cash software can process 30 transactions per second, four times more than Bitcoin. Not many investors in Bitcoin are coders, however, or knew what the fork would entail. There was a period of uncertainty before the fork, and a period of rapid price rises afterwards. Since then there has been another fork – to create Bitcoin gold. The attempt at a third fork was the one that failed to get support last week. This seems to be the cause of the correction in the price of Bitcoin late last week (at the time of writing the price is down almost 20% from a peak of A$9,925 on November 8). However, the price of Bitcoin cash has simultaneously risen from A$818 to A$1,850.

Over the longer term it is likely to gain acceptance among investors for other reasons. For instance, it is deflationary – because there is a limited supply both in the total number of Bitcoins that can ever be created as well as the rate they can be created, the purchasing power of Bitcoin will increase over time. This differs significantly from currencies like the Australian dollar. If you store national currencies under your bed they will, over time, become worthless.  For other investors, the volatility of Bitcoin makes for a good trading environment (e.g. lots of price movements give opportunities to make money buying or selling). You can see this in the above comparison with gold. Bitcoin can also be a long-term investment due to it being unregulated in supply and having some huge benefits over some national currencies: it is global, untied to supply of currencies by central banks, easily transferable across borders, and doesn’t suffer from the considerable transaction and administration costs paid to banks, currency markets and financial traders. Being a relative new market, however, with no mathematical mechanism to predict how it will act in the future, it really it is a case of buyer beware. Our only tip would be – don’t put in more than you can afford to lose.::2017-11-13T18:59:41Z::Bitcoin::Alicia (Lucy) Cameron::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/194266/original/file-20171113-27585-1gdvg8x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C127%2C997%2C498&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
262::https://beincrypto.com/mask-network-social-media-privacy/::BeInCrypto::article::Exclusive Decentralization Unleashed: How Mask Network is Rethinking Social Media and Privacy::BeInCrypto sat down with Suji Yan, the founder of Mask Network, to explore its role in shaping the future of decentralized social networks.::We use cookies to improve your experience. Decentralized social networks remain a hot topic as concerns over data privacy, censorship, and corporate influence continue to escalate. People seek more control over their digital interactions, so the promise of Web3, offering a decentralized, user-controlled alternative, has intrigued both technologists and ordinary users. BeInCrypto sat down with Suji Yan, the founder of Mask Network, to explore the current state of this narrative and the Mask Network’s role in shaping the future of decentralized social networks. Mask Network, led by founder Suji Yan, develops blockchain-based tools that allow users to perform cryptocurrency transactions and access decentralized applications directly through social media platforms. Suji Yan, whose background includes roles as an AI engineer and journalist, is driven by a commitment to privacy and free speech. He envisions Mask Network as a cornerstone in creating an independent cyberspace where users govern themselves and interact without traditional corporate oversight. His ambitious goal is to transform social media into a secure, decentralized environment that supports a fully autonomous digital society. Suji begins by tracing the origins of his company to the early ideas sparked by the limitations of traditional finance. «Bitcoin is great… it saves the money, right? Bitcoin is the peer money and digital gold. And Ethereum is the programmable machine, the infinite machine on a smart contract», he articulates. His vision, however, extends beyond these pioneering technologies towards a grander aim of creating a fully autonomous digital society. “My bigger dream, my bigger perspective for our industry is that we eventually can become an independent cyberspace”, he explains, envisioning a new kind of governance, society, and communication platform grounded in blockchain technology. “If you want to create a society, you will need your own platforms where people can gather and talk without worrying that one day AWS is going to kill the Facebook server and you will be de-platformized”. Suji enthusiastically recounts the early days when Mask Network was still taking shape. The team was officially assembled in 2016, with the company forming in 2017 amidst a bull market with its ICO craze. Mask Network, however, was keen on building a sustainable long-term vision. “We did a lot of research. We write a lot of codes. And we built something that people never seen before”, he says, emphasizing the innovative spirit of his team. Mask Network quickly garnered support from key figures in the blockchain community. Ethereum co-founders Vitalik Buterin and Mihai Aliesie were early users of the Mask extension. This period of subsequent adoption of their technology laid a solid foundation for Mask Network’s ambitions, setting the stage for further development and continued evolution toward a decentralized digital society. Suji recognizes the journey toward decentralizing social networks as a long-term endeavor. Reflecting on discussions in 2018, he noted how major platforms like Facebook initially flirted with decentralization before stepping back. Interestingly, they are revisiting these ideas, paralleling X/Twitter’s intermittent experiments with decentralization strategies, including during Jack Dorsey’s tenure and more recently under Elon Musk’s direction, who has shifted his focus towards integrating AI. This narrative underlines that developing a comprehensive suite of technologies for decentralized social networks presents significant challenges. Unlike more straightforward financial applications in the blockchain space, such as DeFi or cryptocurrency exchanges, which benefit from clear, measurable success metrics like trading volume or total value locked (TVL), social platforms require nuanced, complex solutions that must evolve to meet the diverse needs of users and the nature of social interaction online. This complexity makes the path to decentralization innovative and fraught with continuous learning and adaptation. Despite all hurdles, Suji remains optimistic about the future, drawing parallels with the early days of DeFi, which also faced skepticism and slow initial growth. He anticipates a similar trajectory for decentralized social networks, with gradual acceptance leading to more significant breakthroughs. “Social [networks] is very different… it needs a series of events to make people realize we really need decentralization”, he explains, citing pivotal moments such as the Cambridge Analytica scandal and recent regulatory actions against TikTok. “For DeFi, it took 7 years: from the BitShare story, BitUSD story, and then EOS, then people moved to Ethereum, then the DeFi summer. If history repeats itself, we’ll see decentralized social networks boom in 2028, maybe 2029”. Suji believes that these foundational shifts in the digital field, catalyzed by major public events, serve as critical moments that will eventually drive widespread adoption. The awareness and understanding of the importance of user control over personal data increase, so will the demand for decentralized solutions. Beyond developing its proprietary technology, Mask Network has played a crucial role in supporting decentralized social networks and infrastructure projects. In 2021, the team initiated the Bonfire Union – the venture arm involved in funding various initiatives, including social platforms, blockchain infrastructure projects, and other innovative technologies that align with the decentralized ethos of Mask Network. Bonfire Union has invested in a diverse array of projects, including: “Bonfire Union’s AUM is over a $100 millions now, but when we launched it, it was just $42 millions”, Suji reflects. “There are many other social things we invest in: decentralized social networks, infrastructure. Financial VC, they don’t see what’s going on. But we’re early and true believers, so we know there are many things that are lacking in this industry”. Mask also became one of the largest contributors to Mastodon, a decentralized and federated social network, and a key shareholder of Lens Protocol, demonstrating a strategic approach to nurturing the ecosystem’s growth. The commitment of Mask Network extends beyond financial investments. In December 2023, Mask established a non-profit entity, Mask Network Academy, which provides financial and technological support to the world’s top universities and journalism programs to promote Web3 research and story-telling. “We actively engage with educational institutions worldwide to foster a deeper understanding of blockchain and decentralized technologies”, Suji explains. “For instance, we’ve partnered with the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and supported Korea University, focusing on encouraging young students to explore decentralized applications. We find it crucial to support these educational endeavors through donations, such as the one we made to the UOPI Foundation, using cryptocurrency to facilitate these contributions. Our goal is not just to fund, we want to inspire and collaborate with the next generation of innovators who can carry forward the vision of a decentralized future”. This dedication to education and development highlights Mask Network’s holistic approach to advancing the Web3 ecosystem. By providing both financial backing and hands-on opportunities, they ensure that emerging talents have the resources and knowledge needed to succeed in shaping a more decentralized and transparent digital future. Suji believes it is still too early to fully assess the impact of their efforts, noting that many in the industry still need APIs, infrastructure, or SaaS solutions. In response, Mask Network plans to offer significant support by providing free infrastructure to their ecosystem, which has yet to be publicly announced. This initiative will cover server and gas costs, allowing emerging projects within their network to develop without financial barriers during their first year. Mask Network’s founder explained that while the company cannot cover excessive costs for projects that secure substantial funding, the team i committed to opening a gateway for those still in the early financial stages. This support includes free SaaS and other resources from Mask Network and its DAO, removing the burden of gas fees and allowing developers to focus on innovation and learning. In the broader narrative of blockchain and decentralization, under Suji Yan’s leadership, Mask Network aims to be more than just a technology provider. They are deeply involved in crafting a decentralized framework for social interactions, where privacy, security, and user autonomy are paramount. Suji emphasizes the importance of this mission in his own words: “Our vision at Mask Network is to foster an environment where digital sovereignty is the norm, not the exception. We’re building tools that allow individuals to control their own data, communicate freely without censorship, and transact securely without intermediaries”. Through ongoing product development, community initiatives, and strategic partnerships, Mask Network is laying the groundwork for what Suji believes will be the next major evolution in how we interact online. Integrating advanced blockchain solutions into everyday social media functionality is paving the way for a future where digital interactions are as secure and private as they are ubiquitous. Suji’s commitment to this vision is clear as he steers Mask Network towards a world where decentralized technologies redefine our digital interactions, making them safe and user-centric.

This landmark decision allows these ETFs to be listed across all major U.S. national exchanges, including the likes of Nasdaq, NYSE, and CBOE. This move culminates a decade-long pursuit for such financial products. The SEC’s endorsement signifies that trading of these ETFs will commence at the CBOE from 9 am on January 11th, coinciding with the opening of the U.S. stock market. The SEC’s filing, which temporarily vanished due to a surge in website traffic, highlighted the approval of 11 issuers for listing Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds: These issuers are now poised to launch their BTC ETF operations, with some ready to start as early as January 11th. Jan Van Eck, CEO of VanEck, corroborated this in a CNBC interview, and other issuers have expressed similar readiness. In the hours leading up to the approval, financial giants BlackRock and ARK 21Shares updated their applications to reveal even more competitive fees. Currently, Bitwise leads with the lowest fee at 0.2%, followed closely by ARK 21Shares, BlackRock, and Fidelity. However, as Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas pointed out, this fee competition might not significantly affect the performance of these ETFs, and it’s doubtful that fees will be adjusted now that the SEC has greenlit the spot BTC ETFs. Following the SEC’s approval, the BTC market exhibited fluctuations and price shifts, with BTC trading below $46,000, marking a decline of over 2% at the time of the report. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

Share this article FTX Trading, commonly known as FTX.com, and its affiliated debtors have announced a major development in their bankruptcy proceedings. According to the newly filed Plan of Reorganization, 98% of FTX creditors are expected to receive at least 118% of their allowed claims in cash within 60 days of the plan’s effectiveness. The remaining creditors are set to receive 100% of their claims and additional compensation for the time value of their investments. FTX’s reorganization plan is subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court, according to a press release published today. The plan, filed 17 months after FTX’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Delaware, aims to distribute nearly all assets associated with FTX at the time of its collapse in November 2022. FTX estimates that the total value of recovered and liquidated assets available for distribution is between $14.5 billion and $16.3 billion, including assets from various sources under both Chapter 11 debtors and multiple liquidators and agencies. Despite Bitcoin and Ethereum’s shortfall at the time of filing, FTX has not benefited from the appreciation of these missing tokens but has focused on other recoverable values to repay creditors. John J. Ray III, CEO and Chief Restructuring Officer of FTX, expressed gratitude towards the governmental agencies and other stakeholders for their cooperation in the recovery process. “We are pleased to be in a position to propose a Chapter 11 plan that contemplates the return of 100% of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors,” he stated. “I want to thank all the customers and creditors of FTX for their patience throughout this process,” he added.

266::https://theconversation.com/explainer-what-are-initial-coin-offerings-icos-and-why-are-investors-flocking-to-them-84330::The Conversation::article::Explainer: what are initial coin offerings (ICOs) and why are investors flocking to them?::Within the world of cryptocurrencies, ICOs are the way to raise funds – but without any government oversight.::Initial coin offerings – or ICOs – have become enormously popular with investors. They have raised more than US$1.8 billion so far in 2017 and one recent ICO raised US$35m in under 30 seconds. But they are proving unpopular with governments around the world. The Chinese and South Korean governments have shut them down, while US regulators have issued a warning that ICOs may be subject to securities laws. This is all part and parcel of the rise in cryptocurrencies in recent years. Bitcoin is the most famous, as the original and still dominant iteration. It was created as a form of digital cash, with a unique property: it is not backed by any bank or government. And it was specifically designed not to be centralised. For this reason it has always had a certain lawless aspect to it and has become the currency of online digital crime. But it is also having a real moment – one bitcoin is currently worth more than US$5,000. Within the cryptocurrency space ICOs have become the favoured way to raise funds in a manner akin to venture capital funding – but without any of the oversight normally found in that process. ICOs are typically built on the technology of another cryptocurrency called Ethereum. Created by a programming prodigy, 23-year-old Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum was designed as a “world computer” rather than simply a form of money. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum is a decentralised payment network with its own cryptocurrency (technically called Ether) that allows anonymous transactions to be sent across the internet without the need for a bank or other middleman. Instead, transactions are stored on the blockchain, a decentralised ledger. Where it differs from Bitcoin is that, as well as allowing currency to run on its network, Ethereum can run all sorts of things including “smart contracts”, which are a form of digital contract that executes automatically once a certain set of conditions is met. ICOs are built on these contracts. An ICO involves creating a sellable token (or coin) that can be purchased with existing cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin or Ether). The investor effectively purchases digital tokens that can be used within a specified ecosystem. Take this made-up example: an ICO for a new online betting venture, “Conversation Casinos”, might issue coins, “Conversation Coins”, which investors could buy and then use to make bets in Conversation Casinos (which would only accept and pay out Conversation Coins). Investors could also decide to hold onto their coins, speculating that the business will be successful, which will increase the demand for the coins and their market value. In many ways, these tokens are not unlike the virtual currencies found in computer games like World of Warcraft and Second Life. They have a utility value, in that they are the digital venture’s medium of exchange (the money). But, often what attracts investors is the speculative value of tokens on cryptocurrency exchanges, rather than the originally intended use. The ICO model has attracted scammers who lure gullible investors into ICOs that are unlikely to ever generate a return. And, since ICOs are completely unregulated, investors have no recourse should the project not deliver or simply disappear. Some ICOs do not allow citizens from certain countries, specifically the United States, to participate, in order to avoid coming under the radar of law enforcement agencies. They are also subject to the volatility that blights cryptocurrencies in general. All cryptocurrencies and tokens are tethered to the price of Bitcoin, the coin that acts as the crypto-economy’s reserve currency. While the Chinese regulators did not explain why they banned ICOs, they were probably most concerned about the danger to investors, given the prevalence of ICO scams. And they probably should be banned if they are merely schemes to avoid securities laws that exist for good reason. Nevertheless, it is clear that ICOs are an interesting innovation. They allow people without access to traditional investment opportunities a chance to invest in companies that appeal to them, without the requirement of a broker (and broker fees). In turn, this allows companies to bypass the traditional venture capital scene and to get their projects in motion quicker.::2017-10-16T14:54:19Z::Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, Ethereum, Finance, Financial regulations, ICO, US Securities and Exchange Commission, securities markets, venture capital::Donncha Kavanagh::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/190359/original/file-20171016-30997-bhko9m.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C790%2C6000%2C3000&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

Stefania Barbaglio has a call to action for Gen-Z women.::In an era where digital natives reign supreme, Gen-Z women are navigating a landscape vastly different from any preceding generation. Born into a world where social networks are as essential as the air they breathe, these individuals wield technology with finesse, utilizing it not only to communicate their identities, engage with others but also to sculpt their public personas. However, amidst the allure of infinite opportunities and the tantalizing prospect of global connectivity lies a paradox: while Gen-Z women are adept at leveraging technology to enhance their personal brands, they may be inadvertently neglecting a crucial opportunity to effect positive change in society. Stefania Barbaglio is the founder of public and investor relations company Cassiopeia. For many young women of this generation, the digital realm serves as both a canvas and a stage. Social media platforms offer a medium through which they can curate their image, projecting an idealized version of themselves to the world without the need for physical alteration. With the rise of influencer culture, these individuals find themselves thrust into the spotlight, their online personas meticulously crafted to garner attention, recognition and status. Yet, in the pursuit of visibility and validation, are they overlooking the broader implications of their digital influence? The proliferation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has only served to amplify this phenomenon. For some young women, their digital avatars or profile pictures serve as more than just a representation of self; they are symbols of status within specific online communities. However, in their quest for belonging and recognition, are they sacrificing genuine connections for fleeting virtual validation? Indeed, the sense of community fostered by online interactions can be both empowering and isolating. While digital networks offer the promise of global connectivity, relationships formed in this virtual realm may lack the depth and authenticity of their real-world counterparts. As interactions become increasingly mediated by screens, the nuances of human connection risk being lost in translation. Moreover, while the digital landscape presents boundless opportunities for self-expression and entrepreneurship, it also reflects and perpetuates existing disparities. Women remain underrepresented in industries such as finance and technology, and the world of crypto is no exception. Despite the democratization of technology and access, systemic barriers persist, hindering the full participation of women in these male-dominated spaces. See also: Women Who Web3 Amid these challenges lies a unique opportunity for Gen-Z women to rewrite the narrative. With the power of technology at their fingertips, they possess the tools to dismantle patriarchal structures and create a more inclusive future. The time is ripe for them to seize this opportunity, to harness their collective voices and drive meaningful change. However, as we navigate this pivotal moment in history, it is essential to ask: do Gen-Z women truly grasp the magnitude of the opportunity before them? Are they cognizant of the power they wield as agents of change, or are they too preoccupied with crafting the perfect Instagram post? While the allure of digital influence may be intoxicating, it is imperative that Gen-Z women recognize their capacity to effect real-world change. By leveraging their online platforms not only to cultivate their personal brands but also to advocate for social justice and gender equality, they can redefine what it means to be empowered in the digital age. The women of Gen-Z stand at a crossroads, poised to shape the future in ways unimaginable to previous generations. It is incumbent upon them to embrace their potential as catalysts for change, to transcend the confines of virtual validation and embark on a journey toward meaningful impact. For in the convergence of technology and empowerment lies the promise of a more equitable and inclusive world for all. Edited by Daniel Kuhn.

269::https://blockworks.co/news/israel-blockchain-startups-empire::Blockworks::article::Israeli blockchain startups face employee crunch amid Hamas conflict::“If you have a lot of employees in the reserves,” Yanowtiz says, “that means half your staff is gone and not working."::“If you have a lot of employees in the reserves,” Yanowitz says, “that means half your staff is gone and not working” 06photo/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks Blockworks co-founder Jason Yanowitz once worked at an Israeli tech startup called Sisense. Amid the outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas this past week, Yanowitz thought back to the many Israeli founders in the blockchain tech space who he knew would be affected. “A lot of the employees are in the reserves,” he says. “A lot of folks are getting called up to the reserves right now,” resulting in an employment shortage for many companies that may be struggling to maintain operations amidst the conflict. On the Empire podcast (Spotify/Apple), Yanowitz points to a startup resources effort launched by Zoe and Michael Burian, who have lived and worked in Israel, in an effort to support startups in the region. The form is posted on X, formerly Twitter, by Shalva Gozland, a healthcare investor at Insight Partners. She claims that more than 400 “talented professionals across various domains are volunteering their time and expertise” to help Israeli startups and venture capitalists while their employees are away for reserve duty. Yanowitz mentions Chaos Labs, an Israel and New York-based startup that has some employees currently living in Tel Aviv. The business provides an “automated economic security system for crypto protocols,” according to a PR statement released earlier this year. “If you have a lot of employees in the reserves,” he says, “that means half your staff is gone and not working.” Yanowitz explains that volunteers can provide their skill sets and other details via the form. “You can actually put in, you know, I’m a data analyst or I’m a salesperson. I’m willing to allocate five hours of my week to stepping in to basically fill the time gap for these folks in the reserve.” “I know a lot of crypto companies who have been impacted, who have a lot of employees who are going to the reserves right now,” he says.  Podcast co-host and Web3 investor Santiago Santos adds that a number of his portfolio companies are either directly based in Israel or have team members living and working there. “It’s a thriving ecosystem,” particularly in the realm of cybersecurity, he says. “A lot of talent is there.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

The SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, quickly refuted this false claim, emphasizing that no such ETF had been authorized. This incident is part of a pattern where hackers have misled cryptocurrency enthusiasts and the general public, especially during heightened anticipation for such financial products. Previously, in December, a phony XRP ETF registration occurred in Delaware, falsely implying BlackRock’s involvement. Although BlackRock swiftly denied these claims, the misinformation briefly caused a 12% surge in XRP’s price within half an hour. The bogus news about the Bitcoin ETF’s approval attracted millions of views shortly after being published, leading to a 3% drop in Bitcoin’s value. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

271::https://cryptobriefing.com/qcp-capital-abu-dhabi-approval/::Crypto Briefing::article::QCP Capital secures preliminary approval to operate in Abu Dhabi::The seven-year-old company plans to relocate some of its more than 70 employees to Abu Dhabi once it secures a full license.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article QCP Capital, a top Singapore-based crypto options trading desk for digital assets, has received in-principle approval from the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) to conduct regulated activities. This development marks the firm’s expansion into the Middle East. The crypto options trading desk, which processed nearly $60 billion in crypto derivatives trading volume last year, is the first Singapore-based digital-asset market maker and broker dealer to receive preliminary approval from ADGM, according to a spokesperson from the regulator. Once it secures a full license, the company plans to relocate some of its more than 70 employees to Abu Dhabi. The United Arab Emirates has been actively working to attract more crypto companies, with Binance, OKX, and Nomura’s Laser Digital already establishing operations in the region. Melvin Deng, CEO of QCP, praised Abu Dhabi’s regulators for their progressive approach to the digital assets ecosystem, considering it as a part of traditional finance. “Abu Dhabi has got very progressive regulators in that they are thinking about the digital assets as a complete ecosystem with all of traditional finance,” said Deng. Deng, who joined QCP in 2021 after spending over 15 years at Standard Chartered Bank, also cited the geographical location as a factor in the firm’s decision to expand to the Middle East. He noted that the region serves as a confluence for capital flows from Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, similar to Singapore’s position. According to an Ernst & Young report, the monthly volume of crypto derivatives stood at $1.33 trillion as of September 2023, with most of the activity taking place outside the United States. QCP recently announced a partnership with Abu Dhabi-based Further Ventures to develop new products in digital assets. Once the firm receives the full license, it will prioritize core businesses such as trading and market making in the region.

272::https://theconversation.com/with-a-new-futures-market-bitcoin-is-going-mainstream-86852::The Conversation::article::With a new futures market, Bitcoin is going mainstream::The introduction of Bitcoin futures contracts will remove a lot of the financial risk associated with the cryptocurrency.::The Chicago Mercantile Exchange will soon begin trading Bitcoin derivatives (futures contracts), signalling the cryptocurrency is now a mainstream asset class. Bitcoin has had limited use in the mainstream economy in part because the volatility of its price. The value of the currency might go up or down significantly between the time a deal is struck and delivery. The introduction of Bitcoin futures contracts will allow investors to manage this risk, and make it safer to hold and trade in Bitcoin. This will make the cryptocurrency more accessible to individuals and businesses, and encourage developers to build more products and services on top of the technology.  Futures and other derivatives are contracts between two parties to fix the price of an underlying asset (currencies, shares, commodities etc.) over a period of time or for a future transaction. The buyer of these contracts commits to purchase the underlying asset at a set price and at a certain date, and the seller commits to sell. There are two main uses for these contracts. First, to reduce price risk by freezing future prices. The second use is speculation. For instance, a speculator would commit to buy a commodity/share/currency at a certain time, hoping that the market price at the time of delivery is higher than the price set in the contract. Airlines commonly buy long term oil future contracts to hedge against the potential increase in fuel price, or to take advantage of what they believe to be a low price. Similarly, future contracts will enable traders to lock in the value of Bitcoin for a defined period of time. This effectively removes the risk associated with fluctuation in value. In addition, since these contracts will be traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the exchange effectively guarantees that both buyers and sellers will abide by the agreement. Read more: Price hikes in Ether and Bitcoin aren't the signs of a bubble In 2010, one Bitcoin was worth less than one hundredth of an Australian cent. As of Monday the 6th of November, the price is near A$10,000. The market capitalisation of Bitcoin is now well over A$160 billion, which is larger than the GDP of most small countries. As the price of Bitcoin has grown, so too have transaction volumes, showing an increasing use of the cryptocurrency. As a result, Bitcoin is starting to look like a credible investment in any respectable financial portfolio. Although, this is not the first futures contract for cryptocurrency. Futures contracts already exist for both Ethereum and Monero. But the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s futures contract is significant as the CME group manages not only the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, but also the Chicago Board of Trade and New York Mercantile Exchange and Commodity Exchange. Combined, these exchanges represent the largest derivative market in the world. The decision to issue futures contracts on Bitcoin rather than another derivative is also significant. So far Bitcoin derivatives have mainly been swap agreements. A swap is a commonly used financial tool where two parties agree to swap financial instruments, such as interest or currencies. The key point is that the two parties, the buyer and seller, make a deal directly with each other. As a swap agreement is not done through an exchange, the risk of a party not delivering on the agreement can be quite high. If one party decides to opt out, the agreement has to be terminated. This leaves the other party exposed. Futures contracts eliminate this “counterparty” risk, as the exchange clears the transaction and guarantees delivery. And unlike swaps, futures contracts are standardised (in term of size, how much is going to be traded, and maturity date etc.). This means futures contracts can be traded at any time until maturity, making them very liquid and accessible. Read more: Taking Bitcoin to the stockmarket won't do much for its risky image The lack of a futures market in Bitcoin was a significant barrier to it becoming a mainstream asset class. You can buy and sell forward contracts on the Fijian dollar, for instance, meaning that institutional funds anywhere in the world can hold Fijian dollars in their portfolio and manage the risks of that asset. But they cannot yet do that with Bitcoin. Until now, there has been no way to offload the risks associated with fluctuating prices. An investor could always hold the cryptocurrency, but they would do so fully exposed to price volatility. The introduction of Bitcoin futures contracts will allow traders to hedge against this volatility and eliminate the currency risk. This will make Bitcoin more attractive for both individuals and corporations. As crypto-assets become a mainstream investment class, other products emerge around them (such as exchange traded funds). It will also have a similar effect to that of mainstreaming share ownership - enabling a much larger fraction of the population to diversify their asset portfolios and income streams. This will unlock some of the value currently being built on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology - new products and services - that are currently only accessible to a relatively small number of the early enthusiasts and those helping build the technology. The increased flow of investment funds into Bitcoin will likely push prices up further, but it will also incentivise more work to build products and services on the technology. Bitcoin just went mainstream.::2017-11-06T19:20:21Z::Bitcoin, Derivatives, Futures Contract, Over the counter, financialisation::Jason Potts::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/193148/original/file-20171103-26426-1f1i7w4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C44%2C1000%2C499&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

Windle answers questions about DeFi investing in Ask an Expert. 2024's Revival of DeFi Yields: This Time It's Organic Ask an Expert Keep Reading::In today’s Crypto for Advisors newsletter, Crews Enochs, from Index Coop discusses the revival of of DeFi Yield and how it will be organic this time. DJ Windle answers questions about DeFi investing in Ask an Expert. - S.M. You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday. In past cycles, yields in DeFi have largely been paid in novel, valueless and inflationary governance tokens. The result was initial bursts of unsustainable activity on new protocols and gains for early entrants. Everyone else was left holding the bag. As digital asset yields have soared in recent months – stablecoin and ETH yield rates hovered above 20%, far exceeding the base rate in traditional finance – some have evinced skepticism about this new cycle of yield farming. But while inflationary dynamics impact current points farming trends, overall the increasing rates are driven by organic and more sustainable demand than in past cycles. Up until early 2023, liquid staking yield was the benchmark rate for digital assets and the only organic yield left, as borrowing demand dried up during the bear market. While the liquid staking rates exceeded federal funds rate for much of 2022, rate hikes last year rendered liquid staking unattractive. Nevertheless, liquid staking remained a solid organic option for digital asset users who didn’t want to move their capital off-chain. As market conditions began to improve in Q1, digital asset yields began to climb. At the end of April, enterprising digital asset users could earn over 31% APY on Ethena, Maker moved the DAI savings rate up to 15% and lending protocols Aave and Compound offer 6-10% to lenders. While these opportunities are undeniably attractive, digital users who recall previous cycles may wonder where these yields come from. For the most part, stablecoin and ETH yields are sourced from interest paid to lenders by overcollateralized borrowers. Stablecoins in particular are the most liquid and in-demand asset in the digital asset ecosystem, and users are borrowing them to lever up exposure to their favorite asset. On the higher end of the risk/reward continuum, some of the biggest opportunities come from points speculation. The enthusiasm for EigenLayer points, most notably, has driven up yield rates for lending ETH, as speculators anticipate an EIGEN token airdrop later this month. Interest in a potential Ethena drop has driven demand for stablecoins. While airdrop speculation is undeniably inflationary, borrowers are paying real interest in stablecoins or ETH that lenders can realize as profit now. Read more about Airdrop points here. Digital asset users who are interested in lending directly to EigenLayer and Ethena points farmers can utilize protocols like Gearbox. Given the extreme enthusiasm for points farming, borrowers are not cost-sensitive and willing to pay upwards of 30-40% to fund their leveraged points farming. Users who are uncomfortable lending against exotic new assets, like Ethena’s sUSDe or liquid restaking tokens, can lend via tried-and-true protocols like Compound and Aave. The Ethena and EigenLayer assets have not been onboarded as collateral for Aave and Compound, where ETH, staked ETH, and USDC remain the primary forms of collateral. Nevertheless, Aave and Compound have enjoyed the second-order effects of the interest in points farming, as well as overall price improvements in Q1. Regardless of platform or protocol, all lending in crypto is overcollateralized, mitigating risk for lenders. That said, lenders do run the risk that borrowing could dry up on whatever protocol they use, resulting in lower yields. Overall, market watchers anticipate that speculative fervor will drive borrowing demand through the next few quarters. Given the cost-insensitivity of borrowers participating in leveraged points farming and other speculative investments, the opportunities for lenders are significant. While conservative digital asset users are understandably concerned about unsustainable yields, current lending infrastructure better isolates risk. For digital asset users who are uncomfortable engaging directly with novel primitives, lending offers an opportunity to benefit from borrower enthusiasm. – Crews Enochs, Ecosystem Growth Lead, Index Coop Q. How might new government regulations affect DeFi investing? As DeFi platforms mature, government oversight is expected to increase. This could lead to the implementation of standardized regulatory frameworks, which may include stricter KYC and AML policies. While these measures are designed to protect investors and prevent illicit activities, they could also limit the anonymity and flexibility that many DeFi users currently enjoy. For the average investor, this means a safer but potentially more cumbersome investment process. Q. What changes with traditional banks' get involved in DeFi? The involvement of traditional financial institutions in DeFi could bring a blend of innovation and stability to the ecosystem. Banks can provide expertise in risk management and access to a broader customer base, which could lead to more capital flowing into DeFi. However, this might also result in lower yields due to the conservative nature of traditional banking. Q. Do DAO's impact DeFi yields and security? DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) are integral to the governance of many DeFi protocols, offering a level of transparency and community involvement not seen in traditional finance. They allow stakeholders to vote on key decisions, including those affecting yield rates and security measures. This can lead to more aligned interests between users and developers, potentially resulting in more robust and user-centric platforms. - D.J.

275::https://blockworks.co/news/kevin-owocki-permissionless-gitcoin::Blockworks::article::Kevin Owocki on building a ‘pro-topian’ future for blockchains::Gitcoin founder Kevin Owocki is all about regenerative crypto ecosystems that are pro-social, pro-environmental and pro-topian.::Pro-topianism is the belief in improving systems with every new iteration Permissionless II by Blockworks Kevin Owocki, the founder of Gitcoin, has a bold vision for blockchains. After recently revealing his intentions to return to Gitcoin, an open-source software funding platform, the founder has been looking into different ways to innovate the space. Since its genesis in 2019, the platform claims it has funded over 3,000 different projects, donating over $50 million to fund public goods with a cumulative grantee market cap of $28.2 billion. In an interview with Blockworks at Permissionless II, Owocki spoke about his vision for the future of blockchains and his plans to continue growing the public goods sector. Keep reading for more excerpts from Blockworks’ interview with Owocki. __________________________________________________________________________ Blockworks: You have previously mentioned that you believe in a “pro-topian”’ future. Could you tell me what that means and how it differs from a, let’s say, utopian future? Owocki: The movement that I am trying to stimulate is about regenerative crypto ecosystems that are pro-social, pro-environmental and pro-topian. This means that it gets better with every iteration, whereas utopian is some ultimate destiny of where the world could go that is positive. I think in order to do that, you can look at it from a game theory perspective. If you can have positive sum games instead of negative sum games, if you can have repeat interactions between participants instead of no-repeat interactions, you can have low miscommunication and you can evolve trust and pro-social behavior. The one that I want to focus on for this conversation is repeat interactions, [and] the reason why is because it evolves pro-social behavior. If you [screw] me over once I’m not going to do business with you again, but if Ethereum is a dark forest and every address looks like every other address, then you’re not going to get these repeat interactions where we can evolve with trust for each other. You’re going to get people who [screw] you over and they’re going to be able to hide amongst everyone else. So, what we need to do is enable the ability to track individual actors in the system so that we can evolve repeat interactions. Read more: Gitcoin’s co-founder wants to return from the sidelines I took an Uber here today. I don’t want to know the guy, where he lives, how old he is, or his birthday, but I do want to know if he’s going to get me there safely and reasonably quickly. So, I think a lot about how our financial lives are intertwined with our identity. The whole line that we’re walking in Web3 is that we want to do privacy-preserving identity. Blockworks: How do you think you can achieve privacy-preserving identity in Web3? Owocki: The problem I’m focused on is Sybil resistance, which is one human, one vote DAOs as opposed to one token, one vote DAOs. If we want Web3 to scale to the people whose financial lives are not their investments or their houses in the Hamptons, if we want Web3 to scale the labor, we have to build more democratic Web3 ecosystems as opposed to plutocratic, one token, one vote ecosystems. The way I explained that, you could be led into thinking that it’s binary, but it’s actually a spectrum. The thing is that once you have a primitive for one human one vote, you can build things that are a spectrum between one token, one vote and that’s what Gitcoin is. It’s quadratic funding and quadratic voting, which is between one human, one vote and one token, one vote. Blockworks: What exactly is quadratic funding? Owocki: So the way quadratic funding works at Gitcoin, is every quarter we have a million dollar matching pool, and that million dollar matching pool is allocated to the results of a crowdfunding campaign — we’re matching contributions from the crowd. The thing is, we’re not matching off the base amount of capital that is put in. Primarily, we’re matching on the base number of contributors to that grant. So basically, if you raise a $100 grant with 100 contributors, and a whale raises a $100 grant, the individual contributors will get 95% of the matching pool. To put simply, what quadratic funding does is it weighs the votes of the people who have a lot of capital less than the projects that have a lot of small contributions that are funding them. So basically, it becomes something that is in between one token, one vote, and one human, one vote. Blockworks: How do you see all of this playing out in the Web3 ecosystem space? What do you envision will happen in the future? Owocki: So here’s the take: In nature there’s natural selection, which is the survival of the fittest species according to which organisms survive or which group of organisms survive. In crypto, we have market selection, which is basically capital flow. You’ve got these crazy summer, winter cycles in which you have had 1,000x growth, and you get all these scams and viruses that are self consuming, and then you get the extinction events where only the strong survive. Because it’s an evolutionary ecosystem, it’s changing so much, and the most effective tactic available evolutionarily changes over time. In the early days, it was just forking Bitcoin, and adding privacy, then it became Ethereum forks, then it became ICOs and alt layer-ones. Later the meta became PFP projects and DAOs, and now we’re at a point where ordinals, and Friend.Tech are the latest meta. What I think is interesting is that as the ecosystem evolves, the meta is always changing. Read more: Bitcoin Ordinals creator wants to clean up BRC-20 standard The cool thing about meta is once someone figures out what the new meta is, there’s a bunch of copycat projects that just replicate it. The cool thing about evolution is that you get this punctuated equilibrium where someone discovers a new meta, then everyone copies it until that meta is no longer the most effective tactic available and the ecosystem moves onto something else. What that does is create a lot of advantages for people who are going to be the first to discover some new punctuated equilibrium. This is my big bet. It’s that the next layer of ecosystems is going to be whatever the next cycle is, and then another layer out from that, we’re going to finally get to a point where funding public goods and democratic DAOs are going to be their own evolutionary tree. I want Gitcoin to be a keystone species that every other project in the ecosystem depends on in order to enable Sybil resistance, and in order to enable public goods funding. So for now, it’s about building public funding and resistance infrastructure. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. Subscribe to the Empire newsletter.

The U.S. SEC is on the brink of making a decision regarding spot Bitcoin ETFs, with trading potentially kicking off by the end of the week. The expected approval, targeted for Wednesday, marks a critical moment for numerous hopefuls aiming to join the rapidly expanding market. Kate Rooney, a CNBC reporter, cites trustworthy sources indicating that the SEC is likely to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs this week, possibly triggering a trading boom as soon as Thursday or Friday. If realized, this move could signal a significant shift in the landscape of digital asset investments in the U.S., paving the way for various applicants. Rooney keenly points out the intensifying rivalry among ETF providers, predicting an upcoming “price war” over spot Bitcoin ETF fees. As numerous applications await regulatory review, major players like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale are preparing for a robust competition to attract investors, both in the pre-approval promotional efforts and in the ensuing fee structure. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

277::https://cryptobriefing.com/crypto-startup-valuations-fundraising/::Crypto Briefing::article::Crypto startups see rapid growth through 'fluid valuations' and decentralized cap tables — Bloomberg::Crypto startups are dabbling with open-ended funding rounds to accelerate their valuations.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Cryptocurrency startups are increasingly adopting an aggressive form of fundraising known as open-ended or rolling funding rounds. This approach allows startups to continuously raise capital and rapidly boost their valuations, in contrast to the traditional venture capital model of discrete funding rounds spaced over several years. According to a report from Bloomberg, the rise of open-ended funding rounds in the crypto industry reflects both the sector’s recovery from the 2022 bear market and venture funds’ desire to deploy previously static cash. With this fundraising model, earlier investors benefit from the rapid increase in a startup’s valuation driven by commitments from later backers. While some investors and industry experts view these “fluid valuations” as perplexing and potentially lacking in fundamental drivers, the report claims that the traditional approach to venture capital formation may not be suited to digital-asset companies. “Capital formation in crypto is always evolving — governance, liquidity, and other important concepts that we’ve figured out in traditional startups are often a little different,” said Matt Luongo, chief executive at Thesis. Thesis is a venture studio, which helped develop and launch Mezo, a Bitcoin L2 protocol designed as an economic layer. Ed Roman, managing partner at Hack VC, noted that crypto startups generally prefer “decentralized cap tables” to help with governance, making the traditional priced rounds with a single, large, lead investor less suitable. Michael Heinrich, co-founder of 0G Labs, a blockchain startup focused on decentralized and modular artificial intelligence, noted that this type of structure is becoming more common when a deal is highly oversubscribed. “Investors are still willing to pay higher prices because it is seen as a signal of market success, even if in rapid succession,” Heinrich said. 0G Labs itself raised $35 million in March through a rolling fundraise, with offers exceeding its planned raise by 20 times. The company’s valuation ranged from less than $40 million to hundreds of millions of dollars, depending on the investor. According to data from The Block Research as cited by Bloomberg, the average Series A round in crypto reached $26 million in the first quarter of 2024, the highest since early 2022. Overall venture investment in the sector increased to $2.5 billion during the same quarter.

278::https://theconversation.com/beyond-bitcoin-the-power-struggle-over-trust-based-technology-84367::The Conversation::article::Beyond Bitcoin: The power struggle over trust-based technology::The development of distributed trust technologies is making traditional institutions like banks, corporations and governments nervous. Those who have power like to hold onto it. What’s next?::Technology blogs and financial news networks are buzzing about blockchain, a cryptographic, distributed trust technology. The key innovation is how it reduces the need for central third-party institutions to serve as central authorities of trust — banks, courts, large corporations, stock markets and even governments, for example. Distributed trust enables co-operative forms of organization without a centre. It can distribute power away from centralized institutions to those that traditionally have less power. Such powerful institutions do not let go of their influence easily. The ongoing debate about how to regulate distributed trust technologies assumes that the advocates of the technologies will seek both legal status and enforceability. Scholars propose that such developments in distributed trust are a competitive threat to nation-state paper currencies. Much of the current, popular focus is on cryptographic currency — or cryptocurrency — applications such as Bitcoin. Regulators are struggling to deal with a fundamental shift in market structure. National central banks are implementing policies to keep control and regulate distributed trust technology. For example, the Chinese government has banned several types of distributed trust activities, and is launching its own non-distributed, centralized digital currency. The Japanese government has made Bitcoin a legal payment method, and major Japanese banks are planning to launch a J-Coin digital currency pegged to the Yen which may be built on a blockchain. Russia initially treated non-approved currency trades as illegal, but is now determining how to regulate them. In fact, traditional centralized, powerful organizations like banks, governments, regulators and technology behemoths are all spending billions figuring out how to use and control distributed trust technologies. But distributed trust technologies have many uses beyond cryptocurrency. Organizational theory has a lot to say about this transition. Distributed trust technologies are organized in what we call a Community Form (C-Form) of organization. C-Forms are not new. They have been around since the 1800s when the Oxford English Dictionary was created by a distributed community of volunteers. The growth of C-Forms was accelerated by technological developments enabling inexpensive peer-to-peer communication. C-Forms came into focus with the last internet-enabled major organizational shift to distributed information-creation platforms. As a result of that innovation, we have seen many forms of information production shift to C-Forms. Open source software such as the Linux computer operating system, which competes with Microsoft Windows and Apple macOS, is produced and shared by individuals in C-Forms instead of centralized software companies. Encyclopedias such as Wikipedia are created by individuals in a C-Form instead of a centralized publishing house. Video content on Vimeo is produced and shared by individuals in a C-Form instead of centralized studios. Similarly, distributed trust technologies are shifting the organizational landscape of how trust is produced and managed from centralized institutions to a C-Form. The development of distributed trust technologies is having a similar enabling effect on the growth of C-Forms replacing the trust functions of centralized institutions. Fundamentally, this is a decentralization of power. Many of our previous assumptions about formal organization are being challenged by shifts to distributed forms of trust. Individuals can now enter into direct peer-to-peer trusted exchanges with strangers. They no longer need a central institution to vouch for the other party. A blockchain-enabled microgrid in Brooklyn is already allowing individuals to sell their excess solar energy directly to neighbours without involving a central utility company. This is a drastic shift to many of the underlying assumptions about how markets and society are organized. As power centralizes, opportunities emerge. Many Silicon Valley success stories are simply centralized platforms. They capitalize on the power and legitimacy of enabling trusted interactions for others. Just as Uber matches riders to drivers, Facebook matches consumers to advertisers. This centralization of power has created an opportunity for distributed trust. The major platforms stand to lose their power as distributed trust takes hold. Such powerful organizations will no longer be needed. But those in power tend to try to hold onto power. Microsoft faced a challenge to its centralized market power as open-source software C-Forms grew. The “Halloween Documents” were internal Microsoft communications about responding to the strategic threat of open-source software. One tactic detailed was “FUD” (fear, uncertainty, and doubt). We are now seeing similar responses to distributed trust technologies. JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon called Bitcoin a “fraud,” and claims governments are going to close down “crypto things.” He is being accused of market abuse in Sweden by a company called Blockswater. Blockswater alleges he “deliberately spread false and misleading information.” In other words, Dimon is being accused of creating FUD. We used to assume that large centralized organizations had legitimacy and power. But that’s starting to change. As distributed trust technologies develop, we will continue to see this power shift. We must question the role of centralized organizations in a time of distributed trust. The key now is to ensure that we use insights from organizational theory, and sociology, to shape our joint societal future in a world of distributed trust. It’s a world where the role of powerful central institutions will be greatly diminished. With such insight, we will be able to design a more equitable future for all.::2017-10-01T23:03:49Z::Bitcoin, Blockchain, China, Cryptocurrency, JPMorgan, Jamie Dimon, Silicon Valley, regulators::Marc-David L.

279::https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/05/08/kgothatso-ngako-how-i-brought-the-machankura-bitcoin-app-to-africa/::CoinDesk::article::Kgothatso Ngako: How I Brought the Machankura Bitcoin App to Africa::Ngako is a speaker at this year's Consensus festival, in Austin, Texas, May 29-31.::Ever since Satoshi Nakamoto dropped the white paper, one of the selling points of bitcoin has been, “You don’t need a bank. All you need is a smartphone.” But what if you don’t have a smartphone? This is the case for millions of people in Africa, which is why Kgothatso Ngako, a former software developer for Amazon, created the no-frills app called Machankura. Kgothatso Ngako is speaker at this year's Consensus festival, in Austin, Texas, May 29-31. Or maybe “app” is misleading, as it’s designed to work on simple phones that lack touchscreens or cameras or the bells and whistles of an iPhone. All you need is the ability to text. Using the Lightning Network, Machankura (slang for “money”) lets users send and receive bitcoin, with or without the internet. This is something most of us take for granted. Consider a bitcoin wallet address: Usually it’s something that looks like “37LaxH5ihB5hZMXs72fofA8qzanipuWTF!” Typing it in manually would ruin your week. If you make a typo – and you’ll make a typo – your bitcoin is lost forever. Thankfully we can copy and paste this monster using our laptop or smartphone. But without a smartphone? “The user may not have copy-and-paste-functionality,” says Ngako. “But bitcoin has these wonderful things called lightning addresses, which are like an email.” Now, users of Machankura can use bitcoin by just typing in normal-looking numbers and email addresses. Before heading to Austin for Consensus, Ngako shares how Facebook did something smart that inspired Machankura, how its 15,000 users are spending bitcoin, and why the usage patterns in Africa are, in a sense, surprisingly similar to the patterns in the United States. Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity. Before creating Machankura, you helped spread the word about bitcoin in Africa. How so exactly? Kgothatso Ngako: I grew up in a township called Mamelodi. So the main barrier at the time was that a lot of the literature that explains Bitcoin is in English, right? But we have all these different African languages. So if somebody is intrigued by Bitcoin and they don't speak English, how would they get content to learn about it? So we started an organization called Exonumia. Its aim is to translate Bitcoin literature into African languages. What Bitcoin literature did you use? I’m guessing the white paper? Yeah, the white paper. A few simple ones. The email Satoshi sent out when Bitcoin version 0.1 released, and Hal Finney's reply to that. And, of course, the "I Am Hodling" post. Classic. And a few others, like Understanding Lightning Network and The History of Bitcoin and the Kenya Government. We're also translating a few books, like “The Blocksize War" and "21 lessons." And then eventually you launched Machankura. What was the goal? So I’m trying to tell as many people as I can about Bitcoin with my translated articles, but I’m met with all these problems. A person may not have a smartphone. If they have a smartphone, they don’t have data bundles on it. If they do have interest or you give them a Wi-Fi hotspot, they don’t have enough space on their phone. All of these problems are solved by having a service that a person does not have to install on their phone, and does not have to pay to use. So USSD [Unstructured Supplementary Service Data] is pretty much that. It’s like a website that is reverse-billed. Look at what Facebook does in developing countries, and I think Twitter did as well. Facebook is available for free, right? People on a mobile cellular connection can access Facebook without paying to access Facebook, because Facebook will settle the bill with the telecom at a later time. So most USSD interfaces work on a similar principle. So what does that look like from the user’s experience, exactly? Especially if they’re not using a smartphone? The user may not have copy-and-paste-functionality. But bitcoin has these wonderful things called lightning addresses, which are like an email, but for human-readable addresses. So mine is kgothatso@8333.mobi. I can share this with pretty much everyone. And alternatively, if someone has my number, 0739 383 807, they could also use that as my lighting address. This is your phone number? Yeah. So whether or not you have copy-and-paste functionality, if you have Bitcoin, you can type out either of the two. And then you can send me Bitcoin. Amazing. How many users do you have, and where are they? So we’re at almost 15,000 users now. We’re in a few countries — South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Malawi, and so on and so forth. What are some of the things people are doing with it? In South Africa, we have a concept called Stockpile. In other places it has other names. In Kenya they call it a “chama.” Effectively, it’s a tabletop accounting. You come together as a group of people in somebody’s home, and you put money on the table. And if we all contributed an equal amount each month, we’re going to distribute it at the end of the year, or maybe buy groceries or whatever in bulk. Interesting. So this is a way to nudge people to save money, through positive peer pressure and accountability? Yes. And also it can be an economic “starter pack” for people in the group, to help them buy in bulk. This would satisfy a minimum purchase order that one person couldn’t do on their own, but the group can. Am I right that instead of trying to get merchants to accept Bitcoin — which can be tricky — they’re mostly using bitcoin to purchase gift cards? And where are they spending it? Yes. The top culprits are [internet] airtime, electricity, and groceries. And if you have a gift card for a grocery store in South Africa, you effectively have so much you can do with your bitcoin. You can pay your bills because some grocery stores let you pay your bills at the till, you could book a bus trip, you can even pay for a flight at the grocery store. How many users, from what you can tell, are using Bitcoin as the primary way to pay their bills and get through life? That's not a lot of users. That's a very small number of users from the total. And a lot of people are still working normal jobs that do not pay Bitcoin, right? So maybe it’s like 10% or 20% of the total users. So what’s the main thing that people are using it for? Exploration, I think. That's the major thing. A lot of people are saying, “Okay. I've heard about this Bitcoin thing. So how do I use it?" So a lot of people create an account and then look around, and then you're like, "Oh, okay. This person hasn't came back." And then an all-time high comes around, and then that person is back again. Honestly, that sounds very similar to how people use bitcoin in the U.S. That’s exactly how it is. Thanks Kgothatso, good luck with the project and see you at Consensus.

280::https://ambcrypto.com/dogecoin-price-prediction-all-the-reasons-why-0-12-is-still-a-target/::AMBCrypto::article::Dogecoin price prediction – All the reasons why DOGE can still fall to $0.12::Dogecoin's price depends on a host of different factors - This may be one of them::Dogecoin’s price depends on a host of different factors – This may be one of them  Not many would expect that development activity would have an impact on Dogecoin’s [DOGE] price. Funnily enough, however, AMBCrypto found that assertion to be untrue. We realized this after examining the metric in question. At press time, development activity on the network was flat. This has been the case since 24 April. However, DOGE has also been consistently consolidating between $0.13 and $0.16 during this very period. Development activity measures the rate at which engineers publicly improve a project’s network. Looking back, the metric jumped from 0.39 to 16.24 back in February.  At the time, DOGE’s price skyrocketed from $0.08 to $0.14 to correspond with the aforementioned uptick. Something similar transpired between October and November 2023 too, with both the price and development activity moving hand in hand on the charts. Source: Santiment Therefore, it might not be out of place to assume that a hike in the metric might offer a price hike too. Also, if development activity falls, so will Dogecoin’s price. Now, DOGE could face a hard time reproducing its performance in February and March. Still, it is important to assess other metrics too. This would tell if the prediction is valid or not. One indicator AMBCrypto looked at was the liquidation levels. This indicator shows estimated price levels where liquidation events might occur. A liquidation event occurs when a trader’s open position is forcefully closed. Most times, this happens because the trader can no longer meet the requirements of keeping the position open. At press time, we noticed that the only possible liquidation points between $0.15 and $0.16 were scanty. This lack of liquidity could put DOGE’s price at risk. This could be the case because Dogecoin’s price might not move to the upside as the zone is not magnetic. Hence, a possible move for DOGE could be a potential sideways movement. In a worst-case scenario, the price might drop to $0.12. Apart from this indicator, AMBCrypto looked at Dogecoin’s Cumulative Liquidation Levels Delta (CLLD) as well. Source: Hyblock Positive values of the CLLD indicate more long liquidations. On the other hand, Negative values suggest that there are more short liquidations. At press time, the CCLD was positive. From a price perspective, the reading indicates that Dogecoin might undergo a full retrace. If this remains the case, the $0.12 bearish prediction might be validated. In addition to the analysis above, AMBCrypto also evaluated active addresses. At the time of writing, DOGE’s 24-hour active addresses were 54,600. Three months ago, this same figure was over 250,000. Simply put, the decline was proof of decreasing network activity. Beyond that, the one-day circulation was 325.94 million as well. Source: Santiment Is your portfolio green? Check the Dogecoin Profit Calculator Concerning the price, this fall in activity could stop DOGE from exponential growth on the charts. However, if things change for the better, DOGE might make a move towards $0.12.

With meme coin season in full swing in 2024, this guide covers everything you need to know about the Bonk airdrop. To select the top exchanges to buy BONK, BeInCrypto’s dedicated product team conducted testing over a period of six months. The criteria for the top exchanges covered areas including fees, availability, reputation, and safety. Here’s a small insight into why each platform was chosen. Coinbase As the most prominent U.S. based exchange, Coinbase is a top option for buying Bonk. The platform operates both a brokerage and an exchange. On Coinbase you can learn-to-earn, trade crypto and NFTs, and benefit from good customer service and a user-friendly interface. Gate.io One of the leading exchanges by trading volume, Gate.io gives users access to a huge selection of altcoins and advanced trading features. BeInCrypto found it easy to purchase BONK on Gate.io safely and securely. OKX OKX is another exchange that hosts a multitude of services. The exchange has a non-custodial wallet, a platform token for lower fees, and a blockchain. You can also earn crypto, trade derivatives, and use trading bots.

It presents itself as the Solana-based version of the well-known Dogecoin. As is common with meme coins, Bonk promotes a lighthearted and welcoming community around crypto. In December 2022, a Bonk airdrop was announced for the Solana community, with the token distribution completed by January 2023. In all, 50% of the currency’s entire supply was donated to Solana users. This strategy encouraged widespread ownership and activity in the Solana ecosystem. In 2024, meme coins have increasingly dominated both the Solana network and the wider crypto market. (Meme coins have) been the strongest performing sector in the crypto market so far in 2024, with many (…) pumping 10, 50, 100x. We had the rise of the Solana meme coins, with coins like BONK and WIF. The eligibility requirements for the Bonk airdrop were as follows: Airdrop snapshots are complete! People seem to be liking $BONK so far, 50 Trillion more $BONK (50% of total supply) will be landing over the next 24 hours to great NFT, Art, and Solana DeFi enthusiasts. The airdrop was intended to increase participation in the Solana ecosystem by distributing tokens broadly across its various user bases. The deadline for the snapshot has already passed, meaning users are no longer able to claim BONK airdrops. Links suggesting the airdrop is still open are likely to be scams. The popularity of BONK boosted transaction activity on the Solana blockchain. There was a discernible increase in trading activity following BONK’s listing on significant centralized exchanges such as Coinbase in December 2023 and again on Robinhood in March 2024. BONK’s price surged by 50% just by virtue of its placement on Coinbase, resulting in a rise in transaction activity on the Solana network. Notably, BONK’s trading volumes on Solana significantly exceeded those of other meme coins, demonstrating its supremacy in this area and boosting network activity overall. The charts above show a notable spike in the number of active addresses and transaction activity on the Solana blockchain between December and March. Peaks in active addresses and transactions line up with the aforementioned rises in BONK trading volume during those periods. Although a trend points to a possible connection between these occurrences, it’s important to remember that correlation is not causation. In the case of the Bonk token, while its activity has stunted as of late April 2024, Bonk remains one of the top ten meme coins by market cap. As of April 26, 2024, BONK is the sixth most popular meme coin in CoinMarketCap’s rankings. As for Solana, thanks to tokens like BONK, the network has become one of the most popular blockchains for meme coin trading, alongside Coinbase’s base chain. Whether or not interest in Bonk fades, Solana will likely remain a top platform for meme coin launches, thanks to its low fees and high throughput. In alignment with classic meme coin tokenomics, BONK has a max supply of 10 trillion. As stated previously, 50% went to community holders who interacted with NFT projects, early contributors, developers, and DeFi traders via a Bonk airdrop. The exact distribution was as follows: Bonk is one of the few meme coins that surpassed mere speculative value. The token has been integrated into a variety of DeFi and gaming applications. Here are a few of the key services that have integrated BONK: BONK’s rapid growth has been buoyed by 2024’s meme coin-friendly market. It’s particularly difficult to predict the future of meme coins due to their inherent volatility and speculative nature. Yet, BONK’s status as a humorous token with integrated utility and an expanding ecosystem parallels Shiba Inu’s ascension. While this comparison is bullish — considering SHIB’s growth and position as an established crypto in 2024 — there are no guarantees of gains when investing in BONK or any other meme coin. Remember that this particular sector is well known for its proliferation of scams and rug pulls. Only ever click official links, and remember to prioritize crypto wallet security at all times. The Bonk airdrop distributed crypto to Solana community members. Some of the users that received BONK were NFT projects and holders, DeFi traders, Solana developers, and early contributors. The airdrop was completed by January 2023. To have qualified for the Bonk airdrop, you must have interacted with the Solana ecosystem. This included select DeFi projects and NFT holders. The snapshot for the airdrop was completed in November 2023. Unlike most meme coins, Bonk has many uses. Users can use Bonk in many DeFi apps on Solana. Traders can also use it on Bonk specific apps like Bonk Rewards, Bonk Swap, Bonk Bot, and more. Some apps like Bonk Bot burns tokens. The Bonk DAO has proposed to burn a significant portion of Bonk tokens. However, the proposal has yet to finalize. Due to the exorbitant circulating supply of BONK, it is highly unlikely that BONK will reach $1 without intervention. BONK has a total supply of about 10 trillion. Burning BONK tokens can possibly cause the price to increase. While Bonk is one of the top meme coins, this asset class is a risky investment. Meme coins are extremely volatile and can lead to both losses and gains. However, Bonk is notably one of few meme coin projects that has uses outside of speculation.

MapMetrics is a drive-to-earn project that rewards users with tokens and NFTs for providing anonymous live traffic and map data. Similar to DePIN project Hivemapper, the team hopes to create a decentralized global map using Web3 technology. Read more: ‘Drive-to-earn’ app aims to bootstrap ‘dynamic maps’ with crypto rewards Brent van der Heiden, co-founder at MapMetrics, told Blockworks that the decision was made as peaq offered a variety of modular DePin functionality. “Peaq ID, a decentralized multi-chain machine identity, enables the network to prioritize real machines in times of high load,” Heiden said. “The Modular Functions, such as the DePIN data verification framework, will also help us further expand our DePIN’s own features.” Additionally, Heiden notes there are a handful of potential synergies in the wider peaq ecosystem, including with other DePINs and its enterprise partners, which may enable the team to secure new partnerships to build out demand for the project. “Peaq’s community includes thousands of DePIN enthusiasts, which will help us grow, and the Machine Composability that comes with using the same identity standard across the ecosystem will help us tap into the pool of devices already on peaq,” Heiden said. The transition process will be completed over multiple phases, beginning with smart contract deployments on peaq, followed by moving core business logic over to the layer-1. Afterwards, native token minting will also be available on peaq, and a bridging option will be available to existing holders. Despite MapMetric’s decision to leave the Solana ecosystem, the blockchain remains a popular home for many DePIN projects today.

284::https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-investor-demand-growth/::Crypto Briefing::article::Appetite for Bitcoin ramps up after positive inflation results, shows options data::Investor sentiment shifts towards bullish as Bitcoin options volatility suggests a balanced market outlook.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article CME Bitcoin options suggests investors are showing a heightened interest in Bitcoin’s future, according to volatility data gathered by CF Benchmarks. This increase in appetite is likely tied to the inflation data published yesterday, which came within the expectations for the first time this year. The CF Bitcoin Volatility Index has revealed a trend towards increased demand for options with expiries beyond 80 days, indicating a market positioning for potential price movements over an extended period. Despite more modest changes in shorter-dated options, the overall sentiment is bullish, with expectations of further Bitcoin gains as disinflation appears to be picking up pace. The post-CPI volatility surface further underscores the growing investor appetite for Bitcoin after the recent cooler inflation data. A pronounced volatility skew in short-term options reflects a cautious stance on immediate downside risks, with investors showing a willingness to pay a premium for protective puts. However, the skew diminishes with longer-dated options, suggesting a more optimistic view of Bitcoin’s long-term prospects, as indicated by the increased willingness to purchase out-of-the-money calls. This shift towards a balanced view of potential upsides and downsides, particularly in longer-dated options, may signal a rise in institutional interest. Such investors typically exhibit a more sophisticated market understanding and are less susceptible to wide sentiment swings. Therefore, while some near-term caution remains, the volatility surface points to a growing bullish sentiment on Bitcoin for the medium to long term. The rising demand for longer-dated calls and the moderating skew hint at a belief that the recent disinflation could mark a pivotal moment for Bitcoin, potentially leading to a rally in the coming months.

285::https://theconversation.com/bitcoin-four-reasons-why-the-price-should-surge-in-2024-220557::The Conversation::article::Bitcoin: four reasons why the price should surge in 2024::Twelve months ago, bitcoin looked dead in the water. Now it could be heading to all-time highs.::The year 2023 will be remembered as turbulent for cryptocurrencies, with numerous important developments that ultimately helped to “clean up” the space to potentially make it more attractive to mainstream investors. Notably there was the conviction of FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried for fraud. Top exchange Binance also reached a US$4 billion settlement (£3.1 billion) with the US treasury department over money-laundering charges, which saw CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao agreeing to step down and pay a US$50 million fine. Meanwhile, regulators continued cracking down on other operators, but potentially lost one of their key cases against the industry after a US court ruled that the XRP token, one of the top ten cryptocurrencies, was not a security (meaning a tradeable financial asset like shares or bonds). This means its creator, Ripple, did not break the law by selling it on exchanges. Viewed as a test case for the majority of cryptocurrencies, the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently appealing. While all this was happening, the bitcoin price rose away from the lows of late 2022. It started the year at US$16,000 and ended comfortably above the US$40,000 threshold. So what does 2024 look like for this sector and what key events are on the horizon? The SEC may finally be about to greenlight a type of investment vehicle known as an exchange traded fund (ETF) for the general or “spot” bitcoin market. ETFs already exist for everything from oil to the FTSE 100 to even regions and countries. They track the underlying asset, creating an easy way for people to invest without having to buy the asset directly. Until now, the only ETFs permitted for crypto in the US have been for the futures markets. These niche markets are concerned with where investors think crypto prices are heading in future. Bitcoin price 2021-24 A spot bitcoin ETF would likely encourage mainstream investors to buy exposure to this market, while potentially attracting banks to actively participate too. Bitcoin could be offered by financial advisors and there would no longer be a need for investors to hold the asset itself or face difficulties like crypto exchanges, coin storage and so on. There are various reasons why many commentators think the SEC may now end its opposition to such an ETF. For one thing, the list of applicants includes Blackrock, the biggest investment house in the world, along with various other major players. Also, digital asset group Grayscale won an important case against the SEC in 2023, which had been blocking its attempt to convert its US$17 billion bitcoin futures ETF, GBTC, into a spot version. This has forced the SEC to reconsider Grayscale’s application too. Further, Hong Kong’s regulatory authority has announced it is open to spot bitcoin ETF applications and has laid down guidelines permitting several varieties. As well as the basic model that we may soon see in the US, where investors would buy into bitcoin ETFs with dollars, Hong Kong is open to a second variety known as “in-kind”. This would make it possible to convert shares in a bitcoin ETF into bitcoin and vice versa, allowing more flexibility and potentially attracting more institutional investors into the space. Jerome Powell, chair of US central bank the Federal Reserve, has indicated that interest rates may have peaked, and that the Fed is likely to cut them during 2024. Similarly in the UK, leading mortgage lender Halifax has cut its lending rate in expectation of a Bank of England rate cut. If interest rates are cut or even stabilise in 2024, it could make bitcoin (and other digital assets) more attractive to investors, since its limited supply makes it a hedge against traditional currencies losing value over time. More generally, rate cuts prompt investors to look for higher investment returns, and cryptocurrencies have delivered here too. Asset class returns since 2011 In addition, the US and other economies may enter a recession in the later half of 2024 due to the lagged effects of the interest rate hikes. Equally, we saw a number of bank failures in 2023, predominantly in the US. In the event of a recession or more bank problems, governments may be forced to provide stimulus packages and print more money. This would further devalue currencies and make bitcoin still more attractive. A big event for bitcoin in 2024 is the so-called “halving”. Bitcoin runs on an online ledger known as a blockchain, in which entries are validated by “miners” using arrays of computers to solve complex mathematical puzzles. Miners are paid in bitcoin for completing a set of transactions known as a block, and the protocol stipulates that their reward per block halves every 210,000 “blocks” (roughly every four years). The reward began at 50 bitcoin in 2009 and is expected to fall from 6.25 bitcoin to 3.125 bitcoin around the middle of April 2024. This decrease entails fewer bitcoin sold on the market, which tightens supply and may squeeze out the least efficient miners, significantly reducing the computer power used by the network. The three previous halvings have prompted dramatic bull runs, while also driving up the prices of digital assets more generally as investors take more risks in the space. Halving effects The bitcoin network saw a number of technological advancements in 2023. This has included enabling a new and a unique form of NFTs (non-fungible tokens) known as ordinals, and also a new standard called BRC-20 that makes it possible to create new cryptocurrencies on the network. Until now, NFTs and new cryptocurrencies have mostly been issued on other blockchains such as ethereum. We are also seeing growing adoption of the Lightning network, a layer above the bitcoin blockchain that enables much faster transactions. All these changes are resulting in increased demand for bitcoin, which in turn may lead to higher prices. In sum, there’s a strong case for being bullish about bitcoin’s price in the year ahead. Commentators’ predictions range from US$60,000 to US$500,000 by year end. Our own belief is that though the road may be bumpy, 2024 could well see increased adoption of cryptocurrencies, which will drive prices beyond the current US$40,000 mark.::2024-01-05T17:12:11Z::Bitcoin, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, ETF, Ethereum, Interest rates, Keep me on trend, NFTs, Ripple::Andrew Urquhart::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/568019/original/file-20240105-21-pulhq0.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=273%2C878%2C3970%2C1985&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

The “TOKEN Supercharge Program” will provide preferential treatment for TOKEN holders and stakers, allowing them to secure tokens ahead of the broader public if the proposal passes. The proposed move would further allow eligible users to acquire up to four times more tokens than the standard quota per wallet. Users who do not stake or hold TOKEN may face limited access to token sale events. Users must stake or hold a minimum of $1,000 worth of $TOKEN for the proposed priority access, with higher holdings offering additional advantages. “We have close to a dozen of these token launches already planned and due to be announced in the coming days and weeks,” TokenFi developer B told CoinDesk in a release. “However, we envision a scenario in which some of these token sale events could be sold out in minutes, especially if open to the general public.” This could result in the majority of $TOKEN stakers and holders being unable to participate in these events when they should be the main beneficiaries,” he added. TokenFi, which uses token (TOKEN) as its native digital asset, lets users launch any cryptocurrency without writing code. It was started in 2023 as a sister project to Floki, a former dog-themed meme coin that has since pivoted into a metaverse and decentralized finance platform. At the time of writing, TOKEN prices were little changed, trading at 16 cents, data shows. Edited by Parikshit Mishra.

288::https://blockworks.co/news/blackrock-barclays-jpmorgan-chase-dapp-tcn::Blockworks::article::BlackRock, Barclays use JPMorgan blockchain app in milestone trade::BlackRock used the company’s new Tokenized Collateral Network (TCN) to tokenize shares in one of its money market funds, JPMorgan said.::Tokenizing money market fund shares as collateral via private blockchain network reduces friction in meeting margin calls, BlackRock executive says Sergei Elagin/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks Two financial heavyweights were involved in a milestone collateral transaction via a decentralized application by JPMorgan Chase. BlackRock used the company’s new Tokenized Collateral Network (TCN) to tokenize shares in one of its money market funds, JPMorgan told Blockworks in an email. It then sent those tokenized interests to Barclays as collateral for an over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives trade between the firms. TCN is a private blockchain application on JPMorgan’s Onyx Digital Assets platform. This is the first collateral settlement for a live client OTC derivative transaction that TCN has facilitated. The ability to post money market fund shares as collateral without first redeeming to cash “offers the prospect of greater efficiency and stability in times of market stress,” according to JPMorgan. Ed Bond, JPMorgan’s head of trading services, said in a statement that TCN reflects an investment in the future of collateral markets — noting that this first transaction demonstrates the power of tokenized assets. Read more: TradFi, DeFi convergence continues through tokenizing real-world assets “[Money-market funds] can now be mobilized and utilized in a more efficient way, unlocking new pools of liquidity to be used for margining,” Bond added. The collateral between BlackRock and Barclays took one second to post — versus what could sometimes take one or more days, Ty Lobban, head of Onyx Digital Assets, said in a Wednesday X post. He called the trade “another first” with another of the firm’s blockchain-based apps. “TCN on Onyx Digital Assets is now open for business for institutional clients,” Lobban said in the post. “We have started with tokenized MMFs [and] plan to expand to other collateral types in the future. We believe ultra fast collateral movement will bring huge value to the $25T collateral industry.” JPMorgan launched Onyx Digital Assets in 2020. Its first application was facilitating intraday repurchase transactions to offer short-term borrowing in fixed income via the exchange of cash for tokenized collateral. The company used the Polygon blockchain to trade tokenized cash deposits in November 2022. That trade was part of a broader pilot by the Monetary Authority of Singapore that also involved Singapore’s DBS Bank, Japan’s SBI Digital, Marketnode and Temasek. Lobban noted during an Empire podcast last month that BlackRock was “looking to tokenize money market fund shares,” noting that global clients have shown interest in such features while “almost not caring that it’s blockchain.” Asset tokenization has infiltrated traditional finance, as companies seek to reduce costs and boost efficiency. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink last year called the tokenization of securities “the next generation for markets.” Matthew Collison noted that the blockchain-facilitated trade with BlackRock is “a terrific example of driving innovation in post-trade settlement.” “The tokenization of money market fund shares as collateral in clearing and margining transactions would dramatically reduce the operational friction in meeting margin calls when segments of the market face acute margin pressures,” Tom McGrath, deputy chief operating officer of BlackRock’s cash management group, added in a statement. “We’re excited to work with JPMorgan and Barclays to improve market efficiencies through this first trade.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

Arkham Intelligence, […]::On January 5th, an anonymous person initiated a transfer of 26.9 BTC (worth about $1.19 million) to the Genesis wallet, the very first wallet on the Bitcoin network, created by the enigmatic Satoshi Nakamoto. This event took place at 1.52 AM ET, coinciding with Bitcoin’s 15th anniversary. Notably, the funds deposited were unrecoverable. Arkham Intelligence, an on-chain analytics firm, noted that the sender engaged in complex transactions involving various addresses before moving the Bitcoins to the Genesis wallet. This activity was primarily funded by a withdrawal of nearly 27 BTC from what is believed to be a Binance-owned wallet. The only recorded activities in the sender’s wallet were these transactions. Some speculate that Binance’s compliance team might know the sender’s identity, given the stringent Know Your Customer (KYC) laws governing crypto exchanges. In light of this, a Coinbase director, Conor Grogan, humorously suggested that perhaps Satoshi himself has become active or someone has effectively burned a million dollars. The Genesis wallet, attributed to Satoshi Nakamoto, has mostly accumulated minor transactions since its creation on January 3, 2009. While Nakamoto might theoretically access the funds, it’s widely believed to be unlikely as no activity has been detected from Nakamoto-linked wallets since their disappearance in December 2010. Originally containing 50 BTC, the Genesis wallet’s balance had grown to 72 BTC by the end of 2023. This recent transaction has further increased its balance to about 99.68 BTC, valued at around $4.3 million. The crypto community is buzzing with various theories regarding the transaction’s intent, ranging from a tribute to Bitcoin’s creator, a costly mistake, or a deliberate publicity act, to an attempt to influence market sentiment ahead of potential regulatory developments. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

Non-custodial crypto service providers face legal showdown::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Crypto hardware wallet manufacturer Trezor announced today the discontinuation of the coinjoin feature in its Trezor Suite. The service, provided in partnership with zkSNACKs, the developer of the Wasabi Wallet, will cease by June. Despite the shutdown, Trezor assures users that funds within Coinjoin accounts will remain accessible. Coinjoin in Trezor will be shut down by 1st June 2024. We deeply value the privacy of our users, and it is with great regret that we must announce the discontinuation of the Coinjoin feature for Trezor Suite by 1st June latest, as our partner will no longer provide this service.… https://t.co/KgyWIdtV6v — Trezor (@Trezor) May 2, 2024 Coinjoin is a privacy tool for Bitcoin transactions, allowing users to obscure the origins and destinations of their funds. Trezor was the first hardware wallet to embrace coinjoin transactions. It integrated coinjoin feature into the Trezor Model T in April last year and extended the implementation to the Trezor Model One later in August. zkSNACKs, in a recent blog post, expressed the decision to end its coinjoin coordination service was made with a “heavy heart” and a need for “legal clarity.” The company said Wasabi Wallet will still offer robust privacy features, such as client-side filtering and Tor integration, even without coinjoin. The move follows zkSNACKs’ decision to block US citizens and residents from accessing its services, including Wasabi Wallet, due to recent regulatory pressures. This prohibition extends to related websites and services, with IP address blocking already in effect. Phoenix, another crypto wallet provider, recently announced it would exit the US market due to ongoing regulatory uncertainties. Users are advised to close their channels and transfer their funds before access is terminated on May 5, 2024. “Recent announcements from U.S. authorities cast a doubt on whether self-custodial wallet providers, Lightning service providers, or even Lightning nodes could be considered Money Services Businesses and be regulated as such,” Acinq, the Bitcoin company behind Phoenix explained its decision. The exodus follows the SEC’s recent crackdown on non-custodial wallet provider Samourai Wallet and growing scrutiny over MetaMask. The SEC reportedly issued a Wells Notice to Consensys, MetaMask’s parent company. This notice serves as a preliminary warning that the SEC is considering legal action. In response, Consensys filed a lawsuit against the SEC, choosing to confront the regulatory challenges head-on rather than await further SEC actions. Previously, Uniswap Labs, the team behind the decentralized exchange Uniswap, also received a Wells Notice from the securities agency.

291::https://theconversation.com/chinas-crackdown-on-cryptocurrency-trading-a-sign-of-things-to-come-84014::The Conversation::article::China’s crackdown on cryptocurrency trading – a sign of things to come::The recent crackdown on cryptocurrencies in China is a prelude to the assertion of control over this area by the Chinese authorities.::The Chinese government’s decision to order several Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies exchanges to close shows how much of a threat they are perceived to be to financial stability and social order in China. The decision to also ban initial coin offerings altogether (the unregulated means by which funds are raised for a new cryptocurrency venture) has taken traders and analysts by surprise. China is the world’s largest cryptocurrency market with around 80% of Bitcoin transactions taking place in yuan. The blockchain (a digital ledger in which digital currency transactions are publicly recorded) is poised to have a massive impact on the future of finance. This recent crackdown suggests the Chinese government is determined to cement its place as a leading rule maker and power-broker in the quickly emerging area of cryptocurrency transactions and exchange. The Chinese government released a list of 60 initial coin offering trading platforms and instructed local agencies to make sure all platforms were listed and closed down. The delayed crackdown is in line with previous practice in China. The Chinese government often adopts a wait-and-see approach to activities that are largely unregulated until the magnitude of the activity becomes clear. The extent of speculative investment and the risk of losses to investors if the bubble bursts motivated the government to intervene in cryptocurrency trading. Read more: Can cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin survive scrutiny from central banks? In China, the popularity of cryptocurrencies has been boosted by the tightening of controls on money moving out of the country over the past two years. This has lowered the value of the China’s currency, the renminbi, as investors seek assets in different denominations and chase higher yields. Cryptocurrencies are also popular because they can be used to transfer funds offshore and circumvent foreign exchange controls. The government is particularly concerned with the use of cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings to perpetrate and disguise fraudulent activity, including money laundering and ponzi type investment schemes. Chinese authorities are anxious to avoid any social unrest in the lead-up to the 19th Party Congress. The effects of the 2015 stock market collapse, where the A-share market lost one-third of its value over a period of one month, are still being felt. In some respects, the regulatory intervention in China is mirrored in other countries that have been dragging their heels in coming to terms with cryptocurrencies. It was only in July this year that the US Securities Commission issued a report determining that DAO tokens were “securities” and must be regulated accordingly. In January last year, the People’s Bank of China issued a notice announcing it would be issuing its own digital version of the renminbi. The notice highlighted the benefits of a government backed digital currency in terms of cost, coverage, convenience and security. Read more: The big business revolution: why the future is blockchain In the initial phase, it’s likely that trading in this digital currency will be limited to regulated entities such as banks along similar lines to trading on the conventional foreign exchange markets. By launching its own digital currency, the Chinese government avoids the risks associated with privately-issued cryptocurrencies and ensuring they are not used as a means of circumventing China’s strict capital and currency controls. When China introduces its own digital currency (no formal date has yet been announced), the impact on the global economy will be significant. Not only will it challenge the existing global payment systems and establish China as a leading rule maker in this area, it will also enhance the importance of the renminbi as a global reserve currency.::2017-09-20T07:26:33Z::Blockchain, China, Cryptocurrency, Global perspectives::Andrew Godwin::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/186700/original/file-20170920-25319-7zvkim.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

BTC recently barely moved from its level right before the 840,000th Bitcoin block was mined just as Saturday began in UTC time. Bitcoin had slumped as low as $59,685 on Friday before rebounding above $65,000. Read more: The Bitcoin Halving Is Here, and With It a Giant Surge in Transaction Fees The halving has historically been a precursor to a rally in the price of bitcoin, with the last one, in May 2020, giving way to a run up from $9,500 to $65,000 during the subsequent year. But this time, bitcoin has already embarked on a momentous rally to record highs, rising from $15,500 in late 2022 to $73,680, helped by optimism around the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. and then then the ensuing enthusiasm after they began trading in January. On Thursday, JPMorgan said that it expected bitcoin to drop following the halving as it remained in "overbought conditions" based on the high level of open interest in bitcoin futures. Goldman Sachs added that in order for bitcoin to emulate the success of previous cycles following halving events, macro conditions need to be supportive of risk-taking. Read more: Complete coverage of the fourth Bitcoin halving Bitcoin has traded between $59,600 and $73,860 since Feb. 28 with the upside of the range being protected this week alongside the backdrop of rising conflict in Israel, which has had a knock-on effect across all capital markets. A sell-off on April 12 from $71,000 to $60,000 wiped out $4 billion in open interest from the bitcoin market, according to Coinalyze. The figure across all exchanges excluding CME is $16.1 billion.

Plus, OpenSea ends lazy minting and Yuga Labs announces layoffs Ondrej Prosicky/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks Maybe crypto’s killer app is a tokenized prediction market for dating. Unlonely is a crypto-native streaming platform where creators can launch streamer-specific tokens and host live betting markets. The platform’s most popular channel is “Love on Leverage,” where crypto singles have a live-streamed virtual first date and viewers can use ether to bet on whether there will be a second date. “[L]ivestreams aren’t about consuming content, they’re about experiencing something,” Brian Guan, Unlonely’s co-founder, told Blockworks via Telegram message. “[S]o, perfect place to test tokens.” Guan’s sister and co-founder Grace Guan said the show’s first week garnered more than 5,000 viewers, with a peak of 150 watching at one time. Participants drove a total of $8,000 in trading volume via the betting feature. Unlonely is the latest among a crop of “SocialFi” products to generate buzz in today’s bear market. Friend.Tech has generated nearly $20 million in revenue since its August launch, per DeFiLlama. OpenSea ended lazy minting this week with the launch of OpenSea Studio. Lazy minting refers to how NFT creators could keep their work off-chain until a piece is sold. OpenSea believes “the future of NFTs is one where creators deploy and mint from their own independent contracts,” the company wrote in a blog post accompanying the launch. The company also teased forthcoming “immersive video/image/text modules” and an Editions product making dropping an NFT “as simple as posting a photo on Instagram.” The release drew ire from some in the NFT space for the 10% fee charged on primary drops, which lazy minting did not require.

296::https://cryptobriefing.com/pantera-ton-investment-boost/::Crypto Briefing::article::The Open Network (TON) secures fresh funding from Pantera Capital::The new investment follows Pantera Capital's SOL token acquisition through an FTX bankruptcy auction in March.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Pantera Capital, managing over $5 billion in assets, has recently made an undisclosed investment in The Open Network (TON), a prominent layer 1 blockchain. Pantera’s move demonstrates its strong belief in TON’s potential to drive widespread crypto adoption, leveraging Telegram’s 900 million users and over 1 trillion monthly views. “We believe the TON network is still in its early stages and we are excited to see the adoption of the ecosystem and its new features by Telegram users,” Pantera Capital told The Block. Originally developed by Telegram’s team and rebranded following legal hurdles with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, TON has since made considerable advancements. The network has become a bustling web3 ecosystem, sharing revenue with channel owners, and facilitating advertising payments in TON. Also, speculations suggest that TON, Haskey Group, and Oyster Labs have joined forces to launch the ‘Universal Basic Smartphone.’ Besides, the TON blockchain has also gained traction recently. Last month, Tether integrated Tether USD (USDT) and Tether Gold (XAUT) onto TON blockchain. This integration expands Tether’s reach to 15 blockchains and unlocks new possibilities for over 900 million Telegram users worldwide. As a result, users can now leverage USDT and XAUT for peer-to-peer payments directly on the TON blockchain and within decentralized applications built on its infrastructure. Pavel Durov, the co-founder and CEO of Telegram, also announced the company’s plans to tokenize its stickers and emojis, transforming them into non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the TON blockchain. Durov highlighted TON’s scalability as a key factor in this decision. According to him, TON’s ability to handle millions, even hundreds of millions, of transactions, making it a perfect fit for Telegram’s target scale. Pantera Capital’s latest investment comes as the company is finalizing KYC procedures for a Solana token purchase. The firm is also in talks to raise an additional $1 billion for “Pantera Fund V.” This new fund targets early-stage startups, tokens, and other digital assets.

297::https://theconversation.com/can-cryptocurrencies-like-bitcoin-survive-scrutiny-from-central-banks-84137::The Conversation::article::Can cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin survive scrutiny from central banks?::Regulation and oversight could be the saviour or the death of a Bitcoin and others.::The future of money looks very different in the world of cryptocurrencies. There is a growing consensus among businesses, investors and countries (Venezuela in particular) that these alternative forms of online money are going to dominate payments in the next decade. There may be agreement on the potential, but quite how regulators and central banks will respond is still up in the air. The combined market value of all cryptocurrencies in circulation reached US$170 billion by the end of August 2017, 850% higher than at the beginning of the year, according to CoinMarketCap, a leading cryptocoin prices and market capitalisation tracker website. It is no surprise that this kind of growth sparked much hand-wringing among regulators and central banks, who are still undecided whether cryptocurrencies should be classified as a commodity, an asset or a form of currency. That might seem like an odd discussion to be having. But one of the basic functions of currency is to facilitate transactions in a timely manner. And to protect the security of the blockchain (the technology behind cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin), the processing of Bitcoin transactions is sometimes very slow. Due to restrictions on the limit of Bitcoin transactions which can be completed in a day, it may take a few days to complete a single transaction, rendering the cryptocurrency unable to fulfil the basic function of money at times. Private blockchains can speed up transactions but they are not popular and availability is limited. The call to better regulate cryptocurrency gained momentum after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) issued a staff discussion note stating that banks should consider investing in cryptocurrencies: Any wholesale adoption by the banking sector would clearly establish a huge market for cryptocurrencies, but the traffic isn’t moving entirely one way. Chinese regulators dealt a huge blow to the crypto market at the beginning of September when the People’s Bank of China made it illegal to raise funds through Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). An ICO is a fundraising tool that trades future cryptocoins in exchange for cryptocurrencies of immediate, liquid value. They have become an easy platform for digital currency geeks to raise funds quickly. In simpler terms, ICOs are a crowdfunding platform for future cryptocoins. They have already raised US$2.32 billion, according to industry website Cryptocompare. China is getting stricter in general. It was even reported that it may ban the trading of virtual currencies on domestic exchanges entirely. If this goes ahead, it will certainly dampen the enthusiasm around the sector. But there always seems to be some better news round the corner, and more oversight may well generate the confidence that can overcome concerns. The Russian finance ministry is pushing to regulate the use of cryptocurrencies in the country by the end of 2017, while the central bank has been working on regulation for digital currencies since the beginning of the year. Perhaps the biggest boost for cryptocurrencies came from Finland’s central bank economists, who called the infrastructure behind crypctocurrencies such as Bitcoin “revolutionary” and praised its ability to prevent manipulation. There has also been recognition for cryptocurrencies in countries such as Australia and Japan, which are both implementing polices to legalise cryptocurrencies exchanges. Japan has made it mandatory for Bitcoin exchanges to register with regulators and undergo annual auditing by certified accountants. Singapore’s central bank noted that the function of digital tokens went beyond simply being a virtual currency while asserting some oversight. It said that ICOs would have to be approved or recognised by the bank or recognised under Singapore’s Securities and Futures Act. In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission echoed that sentiment, announcing that ICOs will be regulated as securities and any unregistered offerings could be subject to criminal punishment. This kind of growing acceptance – China aside – is an acknowledgement of the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies as a financial instrument. Looking further ahead, regulators have two options. First, they could implement stricter regimes to ensure cryptocurrency transactions are not related to dark net activities, terrorism financing or money laundering activities. Alternatively, central banks could start issuing their own digital currency known as Central Bank issued Digital Currency (CBDC) based on the distributed ledger technology (DLT), the same blockchain technology behind the cryptocurrencies. This raises the possibility of CBDCs destroying the value proposition of existing cryptocurrencies. The Bank of England has taken a lead in the initial discussion while its peers in Canada, Sweden and at the European Central Bank all analyse the feasibility of launching digital currencies. The wider discussion on CBDCs is a testimony to the fact that central banks are serious about cryptocurrencies, and in a way competing with their growing popularity. In the worst case scenario for this still fledgling market, central banks could decide to make trading or possessing cryptocurrencies illegal. That would be tough to enforce as there is no single organisation or person that controls cryptocurrencies and transactions don’t go through a central clearing house. There is precedent, however. Back in 1933, the US president, Franklin Roosevelt, made holding gold bullion a crime and required all Americans to hand over their cache of gold to the Federal Reserve. If that happens here, then the cryptocurrency market would die a natural death. It all rests now with the central bankers. China has offered a glimpse of a difficult future; crypto evangelists will hope others continue down the more accommodating path.::2017-09-19T12:50:29Z::Banking, Bitcoin, Blockchain, Central banks, China, Cryptocurrency, Financial services, Global perspectives, People's Bank of China, Regulation, Technology::Nafis Alam::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/186390/original/file-20170918-8258-11gwwar.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C220%2C3008%2C1458&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
298::https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/20/runes-protocol-launches-on-bitcoin-sending-fees-soaring-as-users-rush-to-mint-tokens/::CoinDesk::article::Runes Protocol Launches on Bitcoin, Sending Fees Soaring as Users Rush to Mint Tokens::Though finding value in meme coins isn't always easy.::Despite this being the most anticipated Bitcoin halving yet (at least according to Google search history), it was the launch of the high-profile Bitcoin builder Casey Rodamor’s latest creation – Runes – that turned heads, even among long-time blockchain developers who despise the digital tokens that can be minted on the platform. Rodamor is known for the release of Ordinals, a protocol that allows people to “inscribe” data on the smallest units of bitcoin (i.e. satoshis) to create highly valued assets on Bitcoin. Ordinals is largely credited for inspiring a renewed developer ecosystem on Bitcoin. Runes is similar to Ordinals, in that it allows people to “etch” and mint tokens on-chain – the main difference is that ordinals are “non-fungible” (i.e. one-of-a-kind) while Runes will function more like meme coins, which have recently taken crypto markets by storm. The first Runes project to mint was Rodamor’s own UNCOMMON•GOODS project, which was announced well in advance of the halving, as were many of the projects looking to etch themselves on these highly coveted satoshis. See also: The Bitcoin Halving Is Here, and With It a Giant Surge in Transaction Fees Impossible to know in advance, however, is what other projects would be able to find space on these scarce satoshis. There are already quite literally hundreds of Runes projects that are currently being minted and looking for prospective buyers. About nine blocks after the halving, Runes minters had already paid 78.6 BTC in fees (~$4.95 million) in order to buy the rarest of the rare. This suggests that, like Ordinals, the Runes protocol could be a boon to Bitcoin’s burgeoning fee economy. What makes a Runes project potentially viable is something of a subjective measure: being an early project to list — like DOG•GO•TO•THE•MOON, which has the honor of being “Rune Number 3” — is one measure. But buyers are also judging projects based on the “quality” of its ticker. A number of Runes projects were already starting to mint before the halving happened, including DOG•DOG•DOG•DOG•DOG, MEME•ECONOMICS, SHORT•THE•WORLD and PEPE•WIT•HONKERS, including dozens others, according to runebtc.xyz. Prior to the halving block being mined, prospective buyers in an X Space hosted by Leonidas, a well-regarded Ordinals collector, users and speculators alike were discussing which Runes to mint and trading ticker names. Among the names dropped were Taproot Wizards, the Ordinals project co-created by Bitcoin OG influencers Eric Wall and Udi Wertheimer, and a project called Satoshi Nakamoto, named after Bitcoin’s creator, which at press time had over 5,000 holders who minted about 19,000 tokens. Which projects will actually prove to have long term value is hard to judge. “Yeah, I don't see any good memes, like, I mean, I'm just trying to figure it out,” one trader said. “To be quite frank, I haven’t minted anything yet.” See also: Runes DEX Secures $2 Million in Seed Investment to Pioneer AMM on Bitcoin “I’m trying to understand the space in general right now,” someone else responded. “These projects are like early Runes. Do you guys think that these are actually going to be the most valuable ones?” “I think it depends what happens with them,” someone responded. Another aspect to consider: how many of the tokens were “pre-mined,” or held in reserve for project creators to potentially release on the market later. Prior to the halving, Leonidas shared guidelines that suggested projects that pre-mine more than 10% of the token supply were “greedy.” “I think the pre-mines are going to be the ones that win,” one trader said. “Because like, it's so hard to come up with a good meme with a 13 character limit,” he said, referring to the hardcoded naming system Rodamor added to Runes to try to prevent “ticker squatters.” In time, Runes tickers will be able to list with shorter names. Within three years, there could be Runes projects with three-letter tickers, for instance. Though it’s unclear how well this strategy will play out. According to data source Ordiscan, one forethinking developer has already blocked off a series of tickers, including ZZZZ (which will be the “first four letter Rune” to mint in two years), ZZ and Z (the first two letter and one letter Runes to mint in three years) and A (the last single character Rune to mint in four years). In other words, with something so new, it’s hard to determine what to value. “As everybody is scrambling to figure out what the hell's going on, I want to just take a moment to say it's awesome being here with all of you,” Leonidas told his audience. “This is essentially the start of a new protocol that kicked off about 30 minutes ago. So let's see what happens. I think it's going to be very chaotic.” Edited by Bradley Keoun.

300::https://blockworks.co/news/fairblock-fundraising-conditional-decryption-privacy::Blockworks::article::Fairblock raises $2.5M for fully private blockchain transactions::With the $2.5 million blockchain fundraising, Fairblock is hoping to make conditional decryption and pre-execution privacy a reality. ::The Fairblock team has recently secured $2.5 million from investors to bring conditional encryption to blockchains LoudPhoto/Shutterstock modified by Blcokworks Fairblock is hoping to make conditional decryption and pre-execution privacy a reality. Conditional decryption refers to allowing users to set conditions that enable protocols to execute transactions without revealing any on-chain information before execution. Unlike zero-knowledge (ZK) technology, Fairblock is designed so that information is only encrypted or decrypted under certain conditions. It does so through advanced cryptography, including identity-based encryption and witness encryption. The company is also looking into fully homomorphic encryption, or FHE, which will enable computations to be performed on fully encrypted data. Peyman Momeni, Fairblock’s co-founder, told Blockworks that the team had secured $2.5 million in pre-seed funding to build this infrastructure. The funding round was led by Galileo and saw participation from Lemniscap, Dialectic, Robot Ventures, GSR, Chorus One, Dorahacks, and Reverie, just to name a few. “Applications like sealed-bid auctions, randomness generation, private governance, encrypted limit orders, all these kinds of ideas can be built on top of our infrastructure using our cryptographic libraries,” Momeni said. Read more: Blockframe using sealed bid auctions for NFT price discovery Momeni notes that Fairblock’s goal is to lower risks for average crypto users, adding that there are still many issues with transactions being front-run or having the contents of a transaction leaked, creating a market skewed to favor people with financial knowledge or development experience. “We want to build something that gives the freedom to users to optionally keep their transactions and protect the contents of the transactions. Transactions can be decrypted under certain conditions, such as a deadline or specific prices,” he said. What this would look like in practice, Momeni explains, would be an SDK that is integrated with the front end of applications that choose to use Fairblock. In a governance proposal, for example, users can submit their votes as usual but have an extended toggle function, enabling them to encrypt their votes. “If their transaction is encrypted, it will go through that normal process, hit the mempool of the blockchain as usual, and votes that are not encrypted will be included as plaintext…both of these will be aggregated until the deadline or other conditions are met, and we will generate a single decryption key using identity-based encryption,” Momeni said. He noted that the purpose of Fairblock in this particular scenario would be to act as a service provider that enables the generation of keys under certain conditions. Fairblock has been built using the Cosmos SDK, but is not limited to just the Cosmos ecosystem, Momeni said. “You can think of us as an Axelar or an oracle for providing decryption keys to consumer chains — which could include a rollup or a smart contract, so even though we are in Cosmos, we can include their transaction and send it to a smart contract on Ethereum,” he said.

Data from Santiment, an on-chain analytics company, shows that the MVRV ratio for Bitcoin (BTC) is now at 61.3%, a peak not seen since April 2022. Back then, Bitcoin’s price hovered around $43,000, having dropped from a local high of about $48,000. The MVRV ratio measures Bitcoin’s market cap against its realized cap, the total value of all coins at their last trading price. A high MVRV ratio indicates that Bitcoin’s market value is significantly higher than its realized value, which could mean it’s overvalued. On the other hand, a low MVRV ratio suggests that Bitcoin is undervalued, potentially offering a good buying opportunity. Moreover, Bitcoin’s MVRV Z-Score, which identifies major divergences between market and realized values using standard deviation, is now at 1.53. This marks a shift from the “buy zone” in January. Historically, Z-Score levels above 1 have been associated with market peaks, and negative values with market bottoms. The current increase in MVRV and the Z-Score’s movement out of the oversold levels indicate that the bottom might have been reached. However, it’s important to remember that predictions based on historical data are not always accurate indicators of future performance. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

302::https://cryptobriefing.com/worldcoin-partnership-talks-paypal-openai/::Crypto Briefing::article::Worldcoin eyes collaboration with PayPal, OpenAI::Worldcoin is gaining user base rapidly but faces significant regulatory and data privacy challenges. Strategy shift::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Tools for Humanity, the company behind Worldcoin, is exploring potential partnerships with digital payment giant PayPal and Artificial Intelligence (AI) research company OpenAI, said Alex Blania, Chief Executive Officer at Tools for Humanity, in a recent interview with Bloomberg News. Details about these potential partnerships, however, remain tentative and non-specific. Blania did not provide concrete examples of what the collaboration with OpenAI might entail. “There’s some natural things in how we might and will work together,” he said. “But it’s nothing that we’re ready to announce yet.” Regarding PayPal, a potential collaboration might still be in the preliminary stages. According to Blania, Tools for Humanity has had conversations with PayPal Holdings, but, as with OpenAI, these discussions have not yet led to any concrete developments. A PayPal spokesperson told Bloomberg that the company does not comment on rumors or speculation. Apart from their specific offerings, Sam Altman’s involvement is crucial for both OpenAI and Worldcoin. At OpenAI, Altman serves as CEO. Under his leadership, the organization has significantly expanded its scope, secured substantial funding, and positioned itself as a leader in AI innovation. While not directly involved in day-to-day operations, Altman remains a co-founder and influential figure at Tools for Humanity. Blania claimed that Altman’s high profile has attracted significant attention to the project and drawn increasing regulatory scrutiny. Worldcoin, in particular, has encountered investigations and regulatory actions in multiple countries. There were raids in Hong Kong, investigations in Germany and Argentina, and a ban in Kenya. Additionally, regulators in Spain and Portugal have raised concerns about minors participating in eye scans. Blania said the company is taking a proactive approach by engaging with regulators and making adjustments based on their feedback. Despite facing setbacks, the company is expanding its product offerings and has introduced more user control over data, such as allowing users to request the deletion of their World IDs. Earlier this month, Worldcoin revealed plans to launch a layer 2 blockchain called World Chain and is upgrading the orb scanning device (Orb). Blania shared that the project is also moving away from the term “universal basic income” to “distribution of scarce resources” to better reflect its goals and avoid political connotations. Worldcoin sparked controversy this week with plans to sell its native token, WLD, to investors outside the US. This move aims to increase the circulating supply of WLD by 19% over the next six months. As of April 2024, Worldcoin has attracted over 5.1 million registrations across 120 countries. Also, over 2,000 Orbs have been produced to potentially verify these identities.

303::https://theconversation.com/are-cryptocurrencies-a-dream-come-true-for-cyber-extortionists-80115::The Conversation::article::Are cryptocurrencies a dream come true for cyber-extortionists?::Cybercriminals increasingly depend on e-currencies to profit from their misdeeds. They, and their potential victims, could be driving some of the growth in cryptocurrency markets.::When malicious software takes over computers around the world, encrypts their data and demands a ransom to decode the information, regular activities of governments, companies and hospitals slam to a halt. Sometimes security researchers release a fix that allows computer owners to decrypt their machines without paying, but many people are forced to pony up to free their data. In 2016, the FBI estimated that the ransomware industry took in US$1 billion – and that’s only the cases officials know about. All that money isn’t paid in cash. Before digital currencies existed, extortionists asked victims to send money by more formal transfer companies like Western Union or make deposits to bank accounts. Those were easily traced. Today, ransomware attacks demand payment in bitcoin and its ilk, systems praised by supporters for their transaction speed and protection of users’ anonymity. In researching cybercrime and cybersecurity for more than a decade, I have found that obtaining cybercrime proceeds is often the biggest challenge that cybercriminals face. In this regard, diffusion of cryptocurrencies is a major development that enables cybercriminals to achieve their goals. In fact, the escalation of ransomware attacks and the increasing prominence of cryptocurrencies may be connected. Some companies have invested in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies specifically so they can pay extortionists if it ever becomes necessary. That helps contribute to the rapid growth in use and value of e-currencies. And as digital currencies become more common, ransomware attackers will have an easier time hiding their illicit transactions among the growing crowd of legitimate transfers. The extortionists behind most ransomware attacks demand payments in bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency. The WannaCry attackers demanded between $300 and $600 per computer; the Petya ransomware wanted $300 in bitcoins before providing a code that would let victims decrypt their data. Not many people actually pay, though: WannaCry victims paid only about $241,000 in bitcoins to the extortionists. If everyone infected had paid, the criminals would have received at least $60 million. It translated to a payout rate of 0.4 percent. Even fewer paid the Petya perpetrators: They got just 66 payments, totaling barely over 4 bitcoins, or about $18,200. Other attacks are more successful: In June, a ransomware attack hit more than 150 servers owned by South Korean web hosting firm Nayana. More than 3,400 of the company’s customers were affected – mostly small businesses running their websites on Nayana’s equipment. Nayana itself stepped up, taking loans to cover a payment of more than $1 million in bitcoins to the attackers, saying it had to save its clients’ sites. The attackers don’t always need to make much money to be effective. Many cybersecurity researchers believe that Petya attacks were carried out with political motives rather than for financial gains. But ransomware has a much higher payout rate than other common cybercrimes. One study found that for every 12.5 million spam emails sent promoting a fake online pharmacy, the scammers got only one response. That’s a success rate of about 0.000008 percent. They make a lot of money – up to $3.5 million a year – only by sending out enormous numbers of messages. One reason cybercrime success rates are low is that victims don’t trust the extortionists to actually unlock their data once they get paid. In 2016, about a quarter of the organizations that paid ransoms were not able to recover their data. The WannaCry attackers were particularly bad: Their system was labor-intensive, requiring the criminals to manually connect payments with encrypted files before letting victims decode them. In fact, a flaw in the WannaCry attack software made it almost impossible to decrypt a paying victim’s data. More sophisticated methods do exist, including those that incorporate what are called “smart contracts,” another aspect of some cryptocurrency systems that runs a particular program as part of completing a transaction. In those ransomware attacks, making payment automatically releases the information a victim needs to decrypt and recover hijacked files. The fear of ransomware is growing. In mid-2016, a study found that one-third of British firms had bought bitcoins just in case they needed to pay off ransomware attackers. More than 35 percent of large firms, those with more than 2,000 employees, reported being willing to pay as much as $65,000 to unlock critical files. Even Cornell University was reported to be stockpiling bitcoins in case of a future ransomware attack. At the same time, bitcoin and other similar systems are becoming much more popular. In 2016, the total value of all cryptocurrencies was 0.025 percent of the world’s GDP. By August 2017, that number had increased more than eight-fold, to 0.21 percent of global GDP – about $162 billion. The World Economic Forum projects cryptocurrencies will hold 10 percent of global GDP by 2027. These cycles are self-reinforcing: The more transactions there are involving cryptocurrencies, the harder it will be to trace where the money is going. As a result, cybercriminals will use cryptocurrencies more often – forcing their victims (and even potential targets) to invest in cryptocurrencies, too.::2017-09-12T02:17:49Z::Bitcoin, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, Cybercrime, NotPetya, Petya, Ransomware, Spam, WannaCry::Nir Kshetri::Home::https://images.theconversation.com/files/185308/original/file-20170908-32268-1xlgj20.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
304::https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/04/21/bitcoin-miners-reap-windfall-as-runes-debut-sends-transaction-fees-to-record-highs/::CoinDesk::article::Bitcoin Miners Reap Windfall as 'Runes' Debut Sends Transaction Fees to Record Highs::The Bitcoin "halving" was supposed to dramatically chop revenue of bitcoin mining companies. Instead, the simultaneous launch of Casey Rodarmor's Runes protocol has ignited a flurry activity on the oldest and largest blockchain, driving up fees. Ordinals sequel 'Preview of what's to come'::Bitcoin's once-every-four-years "halving," which took place late last week, was supposed to bring a steep cut in revenue for crypto miners, since their rewards for new data blocks would drop by 50%. Instead, the simultaneous launch of Casey Rodarmor's new Runes protocol – for minting digital tokens on top of the oldest and largest blockchain – has proven so popular that it's caused massive network congestion, sending transaction fees to record levels and showering Bitcoin miners with a windfall like never before. Bitcoin transaction fees averaged a record $127.97 on April 20, when the halving took place and Runes launched, based on coordinated universal time. That's more than seven times the average fee rate on the day before, and roughly double the previous record set three years ago. Total revenue for bitcoin miners, which includes the block rewards as well as transaction fees, soared to a record $107.8 million for the single day, according to YCharts. The development could be bullish for big bitcoin mining firms including Marathon Digital Holdings ($MARA), Riot Blockchain ($RIOT), Hut 8 Mining (HUT) and Core Scientific (CORZ). (Marathon announced separately on Friday that it was rebranding to "MARA," which happens to be its stock ticker.) The quadrennial halvings were part of Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto's original design when it was launched in 2009, an effort to harden the original cryptocurrency's resistance to inflation with an ever-decreasing pace of new issuance. But with the rewards shrinking for miners, the question has been whether they would see adequate incentives to continue mining on the blockchain – crucial since their efforts are essential to the blockchain network's security. "We expect the particular frenzy pushing fees to these levels to die down in the relatively near term, but this episode is the latest indication that concerns about bitcoin’s long-term 'security budget' are misplaced," the Bitcoin-focused investment firm Ten31 wrote in a newsletter on Saturday. Rodarmor's new Runes protocol can be used to spin up new digital tokens like those common on the Ethereum blockchain but thus far mostly absent from the Bitcoin ecosystem. The launch was highly anticipated because Rodarmor was the primary developer behind Ordinals, which became extremely popular after it debuted last year as a novel way to mint NFTs on Bitcoin, previously unthinkable. Rodarmor himself worried aloud on a recent episode of his Hell Money podcast whether Runes might be a flop; if the main use of Runes was to spin up "meme coins" for fickle traders whose speculative interests can shift quickly, why would these traders instinctively gravitate toward a blockchain optimized for security rather than for speed or low costs? Come, they did, however, and Runes may have outstripped even some of the most ambitious expectations. According to the website RuneAlpha, as of April 21 some 4,923 runes had already been etched, with 801,124 runes transactions and 68,548 holders. "The overall Runes ecosystem will likely be worth many billions of dollars," the blockchain researcher Saurabh Deshpande wrote in a post on Decentralised.co. Several crypto exchanges, including OKX and Gate.io, have already listed some of the newly minted runes, such as SATOSHI•NAKAMOTO, for trading. Jimmy Song, an independent Bitcoin developer and commentator, wrote in a blog post on Saturday that the Runes frenzy has made it nearly impossible to get a transaction included into certain blocks without paying an exorbitantly high transaction fee. "The Runes asset issuance has overridden almost every other use case at the moment," Song wrote. The Bitcoin Layer substack wrote that Runes appears to be a "game of greater fools in which essentially everybody loses," but it does take up block space and may "accentuate the need for hastening the development of and further expansion of liquidity on layer-2 scaling solutions like the Lightning Network." Transaction fees as a percentage of the total miner revenue per block jumped to their highest level ever of 75%, according to the authors Joe Consorti and Nik Bhatia. It's "a preview of what’s to come in Bitcoin mining economics decades from now, as Bitcoin monetizes into a $10 trillion+ asset, demand for the network is orders of magnitude larger than today, and we’ve had a few more halvings," they wrote. Grayscale, the money manager behind the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), remarked on the potentially dramatic change in outlook for miners in an emailed newsletter on Saturday. "If transaction fees normalize at a level higher than in the past, the impact of the halving on miner revenue will be dampened," Grayscale wrote.

306::https://blockworks.co/news/cosmos-ethan-buchman-blockchain-convergence::Blockworks::article::Uniting the blockchain ecosystems: Q&A with Cosmos founder Ethan Buchman::Buchman says blockchains are reaching a point of convergence where previously competing ecosystems are working together to scale the industry.::As layer-2’s scale, Cosmos can offer solutions for the many problems encountered Permissionless II by Blockworks Blockchains today are reaching a point of convergence where previously competing ecosystems are looking at ways they can work together to scale the industry, argues one Cosmos founder. In a conversation with Blockworks at Permissionless II, Ethan Buchman, the co-founder of Cosmos and the current CEO of Informal Systems, notes that there is an opportunity today for different blockchain ecosystems to converge to similar architectures. Additionally, as new chains come to Cosmos, Buchman believes there’s an opportunity to move beyond speculation and into genuine consumer-focused apps — potentially the first step in crypto achieving its political and social ambitions. Blockworks: What do you think of the narrative that different blockchains are finally reaching a point of convergent evolution? Buchman: I think Cosmos has been thinking about many problems from early on that many other ecosystems are starting to come to over the last couple of years. So, in some sense, we’ve had a head start, but in other senses, other ecosystems or projects advanced in ways that maybe Cosmos hasn’t as much, but there’s an opportunity for us now to be converging to similar architectures. So it seems very much that the Cosmos app chain vision we pioneered some years ago is now increasingly being adopted as the way forward. The rollup-based scalability roadmap is very much driven by this app chain scalability vision, where you’re letting each rollup do its own thing rather than a monolithic top-down scaling framework, which is very much Cosmos-inspired. We’ve found the best way to improve Ethereum is to ship good ideas into Cosmos, then Ethereum people will see that, take it, and run with it. People might say you don’t need Cosmos. We’ll just take all the good ideas to Ethereum. Well, where will you get all your good ideas from? Blockworks: It’s interesting because a narrative that has become more apparent over the past few months from the Cosmos ecosystem is an increased alignment with Ethereum. What are your thoughts on that? Buchman: I mean, part of that has just been the emerging success of rollups and the problems they’re struggling with, which we’ve already pioneered solutions to many years ago. So we see a lot of opportunity for them to benefit from the work we’ve done. Cosmos, from the beginning, has always been designed not to be an independent versus sort of thing. The dream was always for Cosmos to help scale Bitcoin and Ethereum when Cosmos started. That’s what really mattered. We always considered ourselves part of the Bitcoin community and very much part of the Ethereum community where we [emerged from], so we owe a lot to and have a lot of respect for [Ethereum]. So, we love seeing Cosmos’ ideas and technology being adopted to scale projects. Although we’ve always felt aligned, it hasn’t always been clear how we can more directly contribute to roadmaps until the emergence and early success of Ethereum rollups. Now, there’s a much clearer opportunity for Cosmos technology to contribute. Everyone’s now getting to the point where they feel centralized sequencers aren’t really a mature path forward. We need to decentralize the sequencer, which starts to look like consensus. And who built the best consensus engine? Cosmos. And you’ve got all these rollups. How will they be interoperable? We need standards for interoperability, and where’s a good standard for interoperability? Lo and behold — IBC on Cosmos. So, with the growing success of rollups, there’s a real opportunity for Cosmos technology to start to get integrated. Blockworks: A common critique I often hear about Cosmos is that despite all the good tech, there aren’t many users… Buchman: I mean, there’s plenty of users across Cosmos. Terra was obviously massively used, and it was built on the Cosmos. Obviously, with Terra’s collapse and bear market, I think a lot of people did sort of move back to Ethereum, where it’s allegedly safer or where there’s more consolidation. But I think we’re starting to see activity pick up again across the Cosmos ecosystem, we’re seeing new blockchains that are going to be built in Cosmos: Celestia, Anoma, Penumbra, they’re all coming up, and they’re all pioneering new approaches to cryptography or to modularity application designs and privacy which can only be done in Cosmos. How many users are they going to have? Well, I don’t know. I think the whole industry is struggling with use cases. There’s a lot of focus on speculative activity and trading, and with fragmented liquidity, it’s difficult to have a good trading menu, so everyone wants to consolidate and that’s why most liquidity is on Ethereum, fair enough. But as new use cases start to emerge, I think we’ll start to see user activity pick up within Cosmos and other ecosystems again. I’m very interested in seeing this technology actually be able to be used in the real world rather than just these speculative use cases, and that’s something we’re really focused on and working on building right now, but I think there’s still a long way to go with all of that. A small part of what crypto addresses and can be solved is a technical problem. But more broadly, there are social, political and economic challenges that it’s going after. Those take a lot longer, and it’s really about changing the structures of institutions, which will inevitably take decades and can’t be measured in two-year product market cycles.

ARK Invest, […]::Cathie Wood believes that the SEC’s decision regarding spot Bitcoin ETFs could have a significant impact on the adoption of cryptocurrencies by institutional investors. She sees the potential approval of these ETFs as a crucial moment, suggesting that it could serve as the ultimate endorsement for institutions considering investments in the crypto market. ARK Invest, in partnership with 21Shares, is currently awaiting a decision on their ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) proposal, and a ruling is expected by January 10. In October 2021, the SEC approved Bitcoin futures ETFs, which was seen as a cautious yet progressive step, despite concerns about counterparty risks when compared to spot products backed by Bitcoin held in cold storage. Most Bitcoin ETF proposals designate Coinbase as the custodian, providing an added layer of security and credibility. A court ruling in July favored Grayscale Investments in a case against the SEC, highlighting the ongoing tension and evolving regulatory landscape. The court criticized the SEC’s decision to deny Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF conversion while allowing futures-based funds, deeming it “arbitrary and capricious.” Cathie Wood’s optimistic long-term forecast for Bitcoin’s value, suggesting it could surpass $1 million, aligns with Bloomberg Intelligence analysts’ high confidence in the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by January 10. This optimism represents a departure from the SEC’s historical reluctance to support spot Bitcoin ETFs. Ophelia Snyder, President of 21Shares, has noted recent changes in the approval process, indicating a potential shift in the SEC’s stance. Recent updates in Bitcoin ETF filings, including BlackRock’s inclusion of seed capital language and technical amendments addressing concerns like Bitcoin mining’s energy consumption, suggest an ongoing and active dialogue with the SEC. The entry of major firms like BlackRock into the Bitcoin ETF space has revitalized efforts by other financial giants like Fidelity and Invesco. Cathie Wood anticipates that multiple firms, including ARK Invest, could potentially receive simultaneous approval, depending on the specifics of their filings. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

308::https://cryptobriefing.com/stripe-usdc-crypto-payments/::Crypto Briefing::article::Fintech leader Stripe integrates USDC payments across Solana, Ethereum, and Polygon blockchains::The company experimented crypto payments with Bitcoin in 2014 but stopped the service in 2018 due to volatility concerns.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Stripe, a major player in digital payments, is set to accept crypto payments, starting with Circle’s stablecoin USDC on Solana, Ethereum, and Polygon networks, as shared by Stripe’s co-founder and President John Collison at the company’s Connect developer conference in San Francisco this week. The coming offering marks Stripe’s re-entry into the crypto payment space. The company hasn’t accepted crypto payments since 2018 when it discontinued Bitcoin support due to high fees and lengthy transaction times, which negatively affected the user experience. Things are different now; both the duration and cost of transactions have been reduced dramatically, said Collison. “Transaction settlements are no longer comparable with Christopher Nolan films for length, and transaction costs are no longer comparable with Christopher Nolan films for budget,” Collison stated. “Stripe is bringing back crypto payments — this time with stablecoins, which are a way better experience.” Stripe has a history of dipping its toes in and out of the crypto market. The firm initially dabbled in Bitcoin payments in 2014, but concerns about its volatility and inefficiency led them to withdraw support in 2018. In 2019, Stripe joined Facebook’s Libra project, a now-defunct stablecoin initiative, but again opted out. In 2022, Stripe began its re-entry into the crypto market by enabling USDC payout feature on Polygon, with Twitter as its initial customer. Stripe’s latest move to accept USDC stablecoin payments marks a more concrete step back into the crypto arena. However, it’s unclear if Stripe will fully commit to crypto payments with this launch. It appears that the company is testing the waters with stablecoins to see if it can offer crypto payments while maintaining their reputation.

309::https://theconversation.com/how-blockchain-could-help-musicians-make-a-living-from-music-52125::The Conversation::article::How blockchain could help musicians make a living from music::Bitcoin, blockchain and automatic royalty payments could transform how musicians earn.::In the decade and a half since Napster, it’s got harder for musicians to make a living, at least from recorded music. Falling CD sales, illegal downloads, the low payments from legal music streaming platforms, and a shift towards buying single tracks rather than whole albums all play their part. Recently, a number of music industry projects have turned to a particular technology as a possible solution to these problems. These include Mycelia, launched by singer, songwriter and producer Imogen Heap, and Dot Blockchain Music, launched by PledgeMusic founder Benji Rogers. Then there’s Ujo Music, Blokur, Aurovine, Resonate, Peertracks, Stem and Bittunes, which already claims users in 70 countries. What links these projects is that they all are based on blockchain. Blockchain is the software that underpins bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Comprised of blocks of data cryptographically chained together in chronological order, it has two key features. It is immutable: data cannot be modified. And it is distributed rather than centralised: many exact copies are maintained independently of each other. Blockchain technology has been touted as the answer to problems facing industries as diverse as banking, the diamond trade, online gambling and fashion – even how we govern society. How might it help musicians? The first problem facing musicians comes down to the fact that no comprehensive database of music copyright ownership exists. There are several databases, but none features every track in existence, and when a track appears in more than one database the details don’t always match up. The blockchain, as Vinay Gupta put it in a recent talk, is both database and network. If music copyright information were stored on the blockchain, via a cryptographic digital fingerprint (like a barcode), then up-to-date information could be accessible to all users, rather than being held by particular gatekeepers. The second problem is payments. Listeners can access tracks immediately with a click, yet according to a Rethink Music report it can take years for royalties to reach those responsible for making the music. Smart contracts, implemented on the blockchain via software, could split royalties in agreed proportions as soon as a track is downloaded or streamed. Such micropayments might not be feasible with current systems, but systems built around using cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin could facilitate payments in fractions of pennies. Third, the mechanism by which royalties are calculated and paid is often opaque. Some revenue ends up in a “black box” beyond the reach of the artists and songwriters to whom it rightly belongs. In a culture of confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, artists (or their managers) cannot properly audit their payments if they are not certain how much they are due. The final issue is cash, required upfront to help musicians create new music. It’s often said that artists no longer need record labels, but funds are required to compete commercially – and that still usually means the backing of a substantial label, especially one of the three remaining “majors”: Sony, Universal and Warner. The transparency offered by blockchain technology could help attract new funders, including investors currently put off by the difficulty of seeing a clear route to profitability for musicians. It could also see the emergence of “artist accelerators” similar to those available for tech start-ups, where early support is rewarded by a stake in future income, monitored and paid automatically via smart contracts. The same transparency and traceability could encourage crowdfunding, with artists issuing shares to be cashed in against future earnings. This is new technology and new terrain. Away from the music industry, another blockchain-related project called The DAO (a “decentralised autonomous organisation”) crowdsourced millions of dollars of funding, only for the site to be hacked and the money stolen. Bitcoin survived a similar crisis when millions were stolen during the Mt Gox scandal, so while this won’t spell the end for blockchain technology it is a reminder of the risk, as well as the potential. Blockchain has the support of banks and even some governments, and there has been significant investment in a number of industries, including music: Stem, a company that tracks and organises revenue from streaming platforms, raised a reported US$4.5m earlier this year. Certainly some claims made of blockchain are inflated, but blockchain does have the potential to transform the music industry. We have to consider, though, whether this is the right way of looking at it. For one thing, there isn’t a single music industry – sometimes, wrongly, assumed to be synonymous with the record industry – but multiple music industries. Blockchain technology would not necessarily affect them all in the same way. In any case, the fact that change could happen is no guarantee that it will. There are considerable barriers to overcome, from issues with the cryptocurrencies themselves to concerns over the integrity of the data, as well as the resistance of industry figures who perceive this new technology as a threat. Perhaps we should not ask whether blockchain technology has the capacity to change the music industry (singular). Instead, we should ask whether the will to change exists and, if so, where; how the considerable barriers to adoption might be overcome; and what the effects, both positive and negative, might be on a number of music industries. With my research colleagues at Middlesex University, in a report and at a panel discussion in London, these are the questions we’re asking. But it’s only the start.::2016-07-07T08:21:18Z::Bitcoin, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, Ethereum, Music, Music industry, Musicians, Recording music, micropayments::Marcus O'Dair::Arts ,  Culture::https://images.theconversation.com/files/129553/original/image-20160706-12703-wp7g3y.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C344%2C1920%2C931&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

Bitcoin is about economic incentives only, not altruism, SunnySide Digital CEO Taras Kulyk argues. The monetary maximalist perspective Ordinals: magically growing fees, usage and fun Hate it or ignore it::In the nether realms of crypto-Twitter/X, there is a brewing civil war between the “monetary maximalists” and “JPEG enjoyers.” While the Bitcoin network is limited in its storage capacity, the threshold for confirming transactions of any kind whether monetary or any arbitrary data from things like Ordinals inscriptions and meme coins is actually quite limited within each block. The mempool can become congested relatively quickly and drive up fees for all users. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package published to coincide with the fourth Bitcoin “halving” in April 2024. Taras Kulyk is the founder and CEO of SunnySide Digital, Inc. Herein lies the conflict: is Bitcoin open to anyone for any purpose? Or did Satoshi Nakamoto have an intended purpose for his creation, which should be accounted for when deciding who can use Bitcoin and how? It turns out there are heavy consequences and tradeoffs for both paths. As the saying goes, “Bitcoin is for enemies,” and we are finding out just how true that is. Here is why the Battle over Block Space is worth fighting, and why the question remains who will ultimately obtain the spoils of war. To begin, the title of the white paper is “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash system,” allowing for “online payments” to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. It makes no mention of file storage. On the surface, this might feel like enough precedent to legitimate monetary transactions only (some treat it as scripture). However, Satoshi himself made an inscription on the Genesis block with the famous headline from The Times in 2009 that read “Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.” The takeaway here is that invoking WWSD (What Would Satoshi Do?) or reapplying what he has done or said in the past via email is a losing battle. Putting aside some of the apparent contradictions between what Satoshi himself sometimes did and said, the core argument for Monetary Maximalism is that Ordinals inscriptions and BRC20 tokens spam the blockchain and abuse the current rule set. They could be considered a kind of DDOS attack. Or worse, a grift. See also: What Bitcoiners Are Saying About the Halving In short, why focus on meaningless, fun-for-some pet JPEGS (often with VC ties) on Bitcoin when the real aim is revolutionizing global money, value storage and peer-to-peer payments. Using Bitcoin as file storage, which is predominately done in wealthy nations, is pricing those out in developing countries that rely on bitcoin for day-to-day transactions. It might even push out new entrants that notice how high fees are, forcing them to explore cheaper options as new users typically won't understand L2s like the Lightning Network — this might be their one shot at giving bitcoin a try. What’s more, given the block size limitations on the Bitcoin blockchain, data / file storage doesn’t scale on the protocol. The only way to scale file storage is to make the system more centralized (which is arguably why Ethereum switched to proof-of-stake) and that is obviously a fast track to obsoletion. And yet, there are very real benefits in the near term for storing more data on-chain, like higher fees for miners, taking market share from other chains and encouraging expressivity and development, among other things. Inscriptions, whether you hate them or love them, have helped jumpstart a fee war, comprising 21% of all fees last year. While it’s true that inscriptions have helped ignite a competitive transaction fee environment (the peak of the inscription craze in May was $18 million), regular daily transaction fees have amounted to $13 million. Miners even saw fees double the block reward multiple times last year thanks to inscriptions. Ordinals are also responsible for the largest block and largest transaction in Bitcoin’s history. That’s no small feat, and as someone who’s deeply involved in the digital mining ecosystem, I fundamentally believe what’s good for miners is good for Bitcoin. A healthy and lucrative fee war, whether they are monetary transactions or ordinals, is unarguably positive for miner revenues in what is proving to be a cut-throat capitalistic industry. What’s more, the top two noncustodial bitcoin wallets (Unisat and xverse) by active users are both Ordinal/BRC20 wallets, with each growing over 30% month over month. What got us here might not be the same thing that is going to get us to where we need to go. In order to reach that level of adoption, the ideology in its current form will have to evolve. The goal is to be the predominant blockchain for everything that, at this point in time, is currently siloed on different protocols. The gravitational force of Bitcoin, by way of engaging fun, cultural and technological movements as found in ordinals, NFTs, etc., will also benefit everyone who owns and is passionate about Bitcoin. When it comes down to it, Bitcoin is about economic incentives only, not altruism. While it’s true the high fees will prevent others from transacting on-chain, it could be argued that this is exactly what it’s all about: free market forces. The fact of the matter is, if you’re a monetary maximalist you could probably get away with ignoring ordinals and be just fine. They’re accelerating Bitcoin adoption and a healthy fee market for blockspace in the near term, and long term are likely to be priced out entirely and pushed to other layer 2 or sidechain solutions. See also: OG Bitcoin L2 Stacks Is Getting a Major Overhaul Naturally, Bitcoin, as the monetary network we all believe it will be, will eventually price out all uneconomic transactions regardless. The network was built from a security model standpoint to bake in higher fees, so the argument that a spike in fees now is bad for Bitcoin later is nonsensical. My take: ignore the noise, let this trend play out, and of course — stay humble and stack sats. Edited by Daniel Kuhn.

312::https://blockworks.co/news/hong-kong-stock-exchange-blockchain-settlement::Blockworks::article::Hong Kong Stock Exchange debuts new settlement system, but it's not a blockchain::The settlement acceleration platform, called Synapse, allows global investors to efficiently handle post-trade tasks across various time zones.::The settlement acceleration platform, called Synapse, allows global investors to efficiently handle post-trade tasks across various time zones. Lewis Tse/Shutterstock, modified by Blockworks The operator of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) has launched an upgraded settlement platform for Stock Connect, which links the exchanges of Shanghai and Hong Kong, modernizing its system of handling transactions. HKEX’s improved platform, called Synapse, will integrate smart contracts through the use of DAML (Digital Asset Modelling Language), a specialized programming language launched by Digital Asset in 2016. DAML is tailored to standardize and streamline post-trade procedures. Using a language like DAML for smart contracts can help clearing agencies like HKEX update and make their settlement processes better. It is a way to modernize and improve the exchange’s settlement processes by automating tasks, reducing risks and increasing efficiency and transparency. Synapse makes settlement processes faster and more transparent, benefiting asset managers, brokers, custodians and clearing participants by allowing real-time data syncing to handle higher trade volumes efficiently, HKEX said in a statement released Wednesday. “HKEX Synapse is a DAML smart contract based integrated settlement platform that supports institutional investors participating in Northbound Stock Connect to better manage their post-trade operations across different time zones, in particular with regard to adhering to the Mainland securities market’s T+0 settlement cycle,” a spokesperson for HKEX told Blockworks. The clearinghouse said that in the first half of 2023, daily trading volume for Northbound Stock Connect averaged RMB 109.3 billion ($15.1 billion), marking a 5% rise from the previous year and a 50% jump compared to 2020 levels. Synapse, offered as an opt-in service, is designed to support institutional investors participating in Northbound Stock Connect, which involves trades settled in Renminbi by both local and overseas investors, allowing them to easily handle post-trade operations across varying time zones. Other financial exchanges have explored the use of blockchain technology to enhance their efficiency, however HKEX clarified to Blockworks that its system is not based on blockchain — in contrast to an earlier document on its website which the spokesperson explained was outdated. Similar efforts have used permissioned ledgers based on proof-of-authority consensus. However, the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) last year halted its blockchain system development, which was aimed at modernizing its outdated settlement layer, after three years of effort. Meanwhile, the London Stock Exchange Group has developed a new digital markets venture, potentially positioning itself as a front-runner among prominent exchanges in embracing blockchain for trading of conventional financial assets. Correction, October 10, 2023 at 6:50 am ET: Headline and story now reflect HKEX statements that references to blockchain in its documentation were outdated.

This incident, involving miner AntPool receiving over 83 BTC in transaction fees, marks the highest Bitcoin fee for a single transaction to date. On November 24, an anonymous user, under the handle “@83_5BTC,” stated they inadvertently paid 83.5 BTC in fees while setting up a new cold wallet. The user speculated that a hacker used an automated script to hijack their transaction, resulting in a fee estimated at $3.1 million. Crypto.news reported the event a day earlier, mentioning a transaction of 139.4 BTC mined by AntPool. The user claiming ownership explained they were transferring 139 BTC to a new cold wallet, which was then immediately redirected to another wallet, suggesting a script-based interference with an unusual fee calculation. The user “@83_5BTC” backed their claim with a signed on-chain message from the alleged compromised wallet, stating they owned the funds. Jameson Lopp, co-founder and CTO of digital asset security firm Casa, and Mononaut, creator of Bitcoin explorer Mempool, confirmed the message’s authenticity. However, Mononaut noted that the signature could belong to either the attacker or the victim, meaning AntPool must use other verification methods. This incident dethroned Paxos, which previously held the record for the highest Bitcoin transaction fee at around $500,000, a result of an error. The miner F2Pool, which collected this fee, returned the overpayment to Paxos. As of the report, it was unclear if AntPool planned to return the funds in question or how it intended to verify the identity of the self-declared victim. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

314::https://cryptobriefing.com/triple-a-paypal-pyusd-integration/::Crypto Briefing::article::PayPal stablecoin PYUSD soon available on Triple-A::Triple-A seeks to bolster payment diversity with PayPal's PYUSD addition.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Singapore-based licensed payment firm Triple-A is set to integrate PayPal’s stablecoin, PYUSD, into its range of token offerings by the end of June, according to a recent report from Bloomberg. With the addition of PYUSD, Triple-A customers can choose from a wide range of payment options, which currently include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether’s USDT, and Circle’s USDC. As Singapore’s first licensed crypto payments company, Triple-A received its Digital Payment Token (DPT) Service license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) in late 2021. This license enables the company to offer a variety of crypto payment solutions, such as domestic and cross-border money transfers, e-commerce transactions, and other digital payment token services. Eric Barbier, founder and chief executive officer of Triple-A, noted the company’s payment volumes tripled from 2022 to 2023 and expressed ambitions to more than double these volumes by the end of 2024. “PayPal has the firepower to make it available to a lot of consumers at one go. Nobody has this power today,” Barbier stated, highlighting the potential of PYUSD to become a leading stablecoin in the market. According to him, stablecoins make up 60% of Triple-A’s total payment volume, with USDT being the most popular choice. This preference reflects the growing role of stablecoins as bridge currencies, smoothing the transfer of funds between cryptos and traditional fiat currencies. PayPal has ventured into the stablecoin space with PYUSD, backed by Paxos, as part of an experimental effort to compete with other crypto entities. Since its launch in August, PYUSD has achieved a market cap of approximately $202 million, according to CoinMarketCap’s data. In comparison, the market-leading stablecoin USDT boasts a nearly $110 billion market cap. To further PYUSD’s adoption, PayPal US has recently enabled its Xoom customers to use the stablecoin for international payments, allowing conversion to USD for cross-border money transfers.

This technology is called the “[blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_chain_(database)”. The blockchain acts as a public database or ledger, and is the technology that stores the details of every exchange of bitcoins. What makes it particularly clever is that it is designed to stop the same bitcoin being spent twice, without the need for a third party (like a bank). Even from the early days of Bitcoin, it was believed that the blockchain could be used for much more than recording Bitcoin transactions. What the blockchain does is record a set of details that include a time, a cryptographic signature linking back to the sender and some data that can represent almost anything. In the case of Bitcoin, it is the number of bitcoins being sent but it could be a digital cryptographic signature, called a “hash”, of any electronic document. One of the earliest demonstrations of the potential of using the blockchain in this way was “proof of existence”, a website that allows a user to upload any document and have its signature recorded for ever on the Bitcoin blockchain. What this does is prove that the person who uploaded the document had that specific document in their possession at a specific time. It can also be used to prove that the document had not been altered in any way from that time. Proof of existence was intended as a demonstration of the potential of the blockchain technology. Startup Stampery has turned this service into a business that allows other companies to “digitally stamp” any of their electronic documents or emails in order to prove ownership and integrity. This week the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the use of the blockchain as a share ownership register for online retailer Overstock.com. Overstock plans to use alternative trading system technology provided by T0.com, to enable people to buy and sell these shares. The attraction of this system is that it provides instant settlement as opposed to the traditional three day settlement for traditional company stock. T0’s implementation of its share register uses an extension of the Bitcoin blockchain called “Colored Coin” that was originally seen as adding a “smart contract” functionality to Bitcoin. One scenario where this could be used would be where someone was sending Bitcoins for the purchase of a house for example, and the currency would only be released if the contracts for the sale went through. Whilst Overstock’s SEC filing does highlight the advantages of having a public ledger that is theoretically secure, it also stresses the risks. One of those is the fact that Overstock has chosen to make the information stored on the the blockchain ledger accessible by anyone, so investors may have concerns about the privacy of their holdings. However, the main risk is one that is a general issue with all blockchain applications, including Bitcoin. This is the fact it is still not known exactly how secure the system is and whether it has any flaws that could be exploited by hackers. One potential issue around the use of the blockchain is the fact that there are now a large number of different implementations, all based on different technological approaches. IBM, JP Morgan, Intel and a group of other companies have just launced the “Open Ledger Project”. Open Ledger does not use the Bitcoin blockchain but implements a different scheme that is more suited to companies wanting to restrict access to the blockchain ledger. There is no doubt that the ideas behind the blockchain are clever ones and were critical to enabling a digital currency like Bitcoin to operate with many of the same properties as cash does in the physical world. When the technology is used for other applications, though, it is not absolutely clear that it actually does anything that can’t be achieved with other, more conventional technology. It is not the technology that is stopping shares from being settled instantly. It is regulators and the issues they are dealing with in terms of this type of settlement are social and legal ones, not technical. In the hype that surrounds companies that are working on blockchain products, the real challenges facing the actual use of these products are often glossed over, with the main objective being to get rid of third parties but without necessarily replacing all of the positive things those third parties may actually have been doing. It is inevitable that blockchain technology will become a mainstream technology. The level of interest being shown in this technology demonstrates its potential for enabling the development of applications that will bring new approaches to old business problems. It is the social, legal and financial challenges that these changes will surface that may prove a much harder problem to solve.::2015-12-17T13:52:39Z::::David Glance::Home::https://images.theconversation.com/files/106506/original/image-20151217-8112-1nlvbd3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

But its latest loss – of money meant for down-bad customers – was an inside job. On Tuesday, a pseudonymous developer known as Hoak admitted to stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies from Cypher's hack reimbursement fund. "I took the funds and gambled them away," Hoak said in a statement, blaming his activity on a "crippling gambling addiction." Hoak's admission comes one day after Cypher's founder Barrett accused him of systematically draining troves of valuable cryptos from the protocol's redemption contract over multiple months, beginning in December. Citing on-chain data, Barrett said Hoak ultimately sent assets worth around $300,000 (at current market prices) to Binance, presumably to cash them out. Hoak broadly stated Tuesday that "the allegations are true." In a tweet, he said he doesn't expect anyone "to let this go unpunished." Barrett told CoinDesk he had sent information about the heist and Hoak's true identity to law enforcement and was following their lead. "This is incredibly saddening to me. I never thought this would be a possibility, having a core contributor who stayed on after the exploit to try and rebuild the project be the one who rugged funds from the redemption contract," Barrett wrote. Cypher contributors created the redemption contract to reimburse customers who shouldered a $1 million loss in an exploit in August. Barrett said the team discovered the funds were missing after one user reported issues in claiming their redemption. Edited by Nick Baker.

Called the Titan Fund, it has a particular focus on early-stage startups operating in the blockchain verticals of infrastructure, fintech and consumer applications such as gaming, metaverse and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The Titan Fund’s investments will be directed towards equity investments in blockchain companies, not digital assets, according to a statement released on Wednesday. Block.one served as the anchor investor, pledging $50 million. CMCC Global, the fund’s initiator, also contributed a 15% general partner commitment. Other notable investors include Richard Li’s Pacific Century Group, Hong Kong’s Jebsen Capital, Winklevoss Capital and Animoca Brands’ co-founder Yat Siu. “The Titan Fund will empower great entrepreneurs to build the next wave of Web3 and blockchain powered fintech applications,” Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss said in a statement. “The last five years have seen a set of new unicorn companies emerge, the next five to ten years will see this trend continue to accelerate as mainstream adoption of blockchain technology proliferates,” he added. The fund’s management is a collaborative effort between CMCC Global’s co-founders Charles Morris and Martin Baumann. This institutional-grade fund is entrusted to State Street as the fund administrator, and EY assumes the role of auditor. Among the fund’s initial five investments, two have been directed towards Hong Kong-based companies, Baumann told the South China Morning Post. Although there isn’t a strict mandate specifying the allocation of capital to Hong Kong companies, the primary focus remains on investing in the most promising entrepreneurs globally, Baumann added. The Titan Fund’s investment portfolio already includes various noteworthy ventures. It played a leading role in backing Mocaverse, an NFT project by Animoca Brands in December. Additionally, the fund invested in Terminal 3, a Hong Kong-based company specializing in blockchain-driven digital identity solutions. Beyond these domestic investments, the Titan Fund ventured into international territory, supporting projects like Informal Systems, co-founded by seasoned crypto expert and Cosmos co-founder Ethan Buchman, as well as the NFT-focused ecommerce platform KickzMeta and its affiliated project, Mooncourt. Further, it engaged with a San Francisco-based Y-combinator team dedicated to innovating in the realm of tokenization of enterprises and assets. With Hong Kong’s recent introduction of a regulatory licensing program for digital asset operators, there’s been a surge in interest from various players, especially cryptocurrency exchanges. However, it’s worth noting that crypto transaction volumes in Hong Kong dropped by about $6 billion between July 2022 and June 2023 compared to the previous year, following a tumultuous period for the industry. This decline also made Hong Kong drop one place in Chainalysis’ most recent global crypto adoption ranking. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

319::https://cryptobriefing.com/ey-blockchain-contract-solution-ethereum/::Crypto Briefing::article::EY launches new blockchain solution to manage business contracts on Ethereum::EY's OCM uses Ethereum for streamlined, secure contract execution.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article EY has launched a new blockchain-based contract management tool, EY OpsChain Contract Manager (OCM), on the Ethereum public chain. The OCM is designed to help businesses execute complex agreements securely, efficiently, and at a lower cost, the company shared in a press release on Wednesday. As noted, the OCM uses smart contracts on the Ethereum public blockchain to automate contract execution and enforce agreed-upon terms. It also uses zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to keep confidential data private. With the new solution, EY aims to eliminate the challenge of managing business agreements across numerous operational and technological divisions within and outside organizations. Traditionally, managing complex contracts across different parties and systems can be slow, expensive, and error-prone. By utilizing EY OCM, companies can synchronize data with business partners and uniformly enforce key business terms, such as standardized pricing and volume discounts, the company noted. The solution is expected to create a secure and transparent environment for all parties involved. According to the team, EY’s solution can integrate with existing enterprise systems via a standardized API, supporting a wide range of business contract types. In other words, enterprises of all sizes can use OCM to manage various types of business contracts. Early adopters are currently testing the system with complex Power Purchasing Agreements that incorporate market prices and strike prices. Paul Brody, EY Global Blockchain Leader, highlights the efficiency of contract automation. He stated: “We’ve identified from past client work that contract automation can improve accuracy while cutting cycle times by more than 90%, and overall contract administration costs by nearly 40%. With our zero-knowledge privacy technology, we have industrialized this capability, and we can now get these benefits at a fraction of the up-front cost. Deploying on a public blockchain is not only cheaper, but also much more scalable, helping enable many-to-many integrations on an open platform with no one company having an unfair advantage by controlling the network. The latest move follows EY’s debut of a beta version of Nightfall in September 2021 in collaboration with Polygon. Nightfall is a privacy protocol that employs an Optimistic Zero-Knowledge Roll-Up to facilitate private transactions on Ethereum. Nightfall concentrates on enabling private transactions for enterprises on Ethereum, addressing concerns like network congestion and high transaction costs. Its primary use is safeguarding transaction privacy while benefiting from the public Ethereum blockchain’s security features.

Called Bitcoin miners, they effectively record each transaction on a ledger called the Blockchain…::Bitcoin relies on the participation of people and organisations to act as the “bankers” of the system. Called Bitcoin miners, they effectively record each transaction on a ledger called the Blockchain and in return, they are awarded with bitcoins. The process of mining is to do a series of calculations to discover a specific number, and the first one to do so gets the reward of 25 bitcoins (valued at approximately US $10,500). In order to increase their chances, Bitcoin miners have large numbers of computers with specialised hardware that consume significant amounts of electricity. The entire Bitcoin system has been estimated to use about 350 Megawatts of electricity which is the same demand as 280,000 US homes. For miners, electricity usage is the majority of the cost of producing bitcoins and this is why China, with its relatively low energy costs, has become the country of choice for this type of operation. The economics of Bitcoin mining only make sense if the price of Bitcoin is maintained. Around July 18th however, Bitcoin will go through a process whereby the reward allocated to Bitcoin miners is halved. This happens every 4 years and was added into the design of Bitcoin as a way of slowly reaching the limit of the total number of Bitcoins to 21 million. The design also assumes that as the production of new Bitcoins from the mining process slows down, the incentives for mining will be made up by adding transaction costs to the process. Of course, unless the price of Bitcoin goes up, more pressure will be put on Bitcoin miners to continue operating after their profits have been slashed. Although anything could happen, Bitcoin miners could potentially decide that mining an alternative cryptocurrency like Ethereum might be easier than continuing with Bitcoin. The uncertainty of what will happen after Bitcoin goes through this “halving” process has already had one significant casualty. Bitcoin Group, an Australian Bitcoin mining company was hoping to list on the Australian Stock Exchange this year but last month abandoned its plans for an IPO. The Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) didn’t believe that Bitcoin Group could assure its capital adequacy after the Bitcoin halving process and so clearly ASIC at least didn’t think that the price of Bitcoin was going to go up as a result. The truth of the matter is that nobody really knows what will happen. On the one hand, there will be fewer bitcoins being generated each day and some people have argued that this will create a shortage of supply that will drive prices up. This of course assumes that supply of bitcoins is constrained in any way which it is not clear that it is. On the other hand, Bitcoin miners will be making fewer bitcoins and may have to sell more bitcoins to pay their expenses which could drive the price of bitcoins down. Ultimately, if the process of mining bitcoins becomes too unprofitable, they will stop altogether and switch to another cryptocurrency and this would largely spell the end of Bitcoin. Unfortunately, predicting anything about Bitcoin is made more difficult because of a number of factors involved in how the mining process works and ultimately what is actually driving the Bitcoin market. Given that Bitcoin is largely an experiment in creating a novel form of currency, the uncertainty is unsurprising. The designers of Bitcoin possibly expected that the community would be able to respond to knowledge gained as the experiment ran, but that hasn’t turned out to be the case. Instead, the Bitcoin community has been fractured with an ongoing argument of how to modify one aspect of the Blockchain, what size the blocks that make it up should be. Given that achieving any sort of compromise on this question proved so difficult, the interest in cryptocurrencies is rapidly shifting away from Bitcoin to the Blockchain and to other currencies like Ethereum. Ethereum is like the version 2 that Bitcoin should have had. It has a range of new features that make the Ethereum Blockchain capable of supporting so-called “smart contracts” but more importantly, it is moving away from the extremely wasteful mining process of Bitcoin to another system that promises to be much more efficient. Given that by 2020, Bitcoin is predicted to be globally using more electricity than the entire country of Denmark currently does, a more efficient system can not come too soon. The halving is another bump in the technological and social experiment that has been the evolution of Bitcoin. Whether it derails the project entirely will only become apparent in the months that follow.::2016-04-03T14:31:21Z::::David Glance::Home::https://images.theconversation.com/files/117200/original/image-20160403-6797-1db503u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
321::https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/05/14/vanguard-said-set-to-name-ex-blackrock-etf-exec-as-ceo-wsj/::CoinDesk::article::Vanguard, Avowedly Anti-Crypto, Names Bitcoin-Friendly Ex-BlackRock Exec as CEO Consensus 2024: All Eyes on Regulation::Samil Ramji, who led BlackRock’s ETF business including the launch of the firm’s spot bitcoin product, departed the firm in January.::Vanguard named the BlackRock executive who oversaw the firm's launch of its bitcoin exchange-traded fund as its new CEO on Tuesday evening. Salim Ramji left BlackRock in January to “seek a new leadership or entrepreneurial opportunity outside the firm,” he said then. The move came shortly after the asset manager launched the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which Ramji oversaw the filing and logistics for, according to Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. "He has been quoted about his interest in digital assets although I'm not sure that's going to change Vanguard's stance but he will be the CEO. Who knows. Door much more open now IMO," Balchunas wrote in a post on X. The Wall Street Journal first reported the appointment earlier on Tuesday, with the company confirming his appointment in a press release later in the evening. In a statement, Ramji said he would be working with Vanguard's leadership to "lead the company into the future." "The current investor landscape is changing, and that presents opportunities for Vanguard to further its mission of giving people the best chance for investment success, which is more relevant today than at any time in the firm's five-decade history," he said. "My focus will be to mobilize Vanguard to meet the moment while staying true to that core purpose – remaining the trusted firm that takes a stand for all investors." Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store said: “Will be interesting to see if Salim Ramji tries to help Vanguard investors gain access to crypto as he believed in doing for BlackRock investors." The pick comes as a surprise given Vanguard’s negative stance on bitcoin and Ramji’s known interest in the industry, sparking chatter on social media that the asset manager might change its stance. “The underlying technology that underpins bitcoin and the blockchain technology, something that we’re incredibly excited about, and we’re excited about it because it removes frictions or at least has the promise of removing frictions across the ecosystem,” Ramji said in an interview on Bloomberg TV in July 2023. “The underpinnings are really powerful for us and that really sparked our interest.” If confirmed, this will also mark the first time that Vanguard is hiring a CEO from outside the company.

Pulsr, an AI-powered search engine for NFTs, is launching a new token. The genesis of PULSR is taking place on Thursday, April 25 at 11.30am EST — and will fuel the project’s ambition to make on-chain assets across the Web3 ecosystem more visible. Established in 2021, Pulsr says there are huge discovery gaps as platforms struggle to index collectibles across blockchains and mediums. This ultimately means creators need the time and skill to build communities on separate social networks, newly minted pieces are penalized by algorithms, and audiences struggle to find content they’ll love. Backed by the likes of Spartan Ventures and Sequoia, Pulsr utilizes artificial intelligence by enhancing the metadata of past and present non-fungible tokens. This allows visual and audio content to be accurately analyzed, labeled and conceptualized into text — unlocking a new era of search engine optimization. Whereas searches for affordable pixel art, NFTs of penguins or on-chain art inspired by techno would have once yielded little to no results, Pulsr scours the whole of Web3 so users can find exciting collections based on their preferences, rather than relying on word of mouth. Enthusiasts with art already in their wallet can uncover similar creations, connect with like-minded collectors, and bookmark the NFTs that inspire them. Another service offered by Pulsr is NAME — otherwise known as NFT Automated Metadata Enhancement. Here, creators about to mint their collection can opt into having detailed metadata labels generated using AI-enabled computer vision. Now, key attributes about the artwork will become searchable in marketplaces — covering everything from materials to style, and from colors to shapes. Pulsr founder Maxine Ryan said: “Pulsr delivers automated and compounded indexing for non-financial assets on the blockchain for the very first time. Our technology is a crucial step toward increasing the adoption of NFTs. The world of digital art is now multi-chain and multi-medium — and we’ll be supporting talented content creators every step of the way.” This is where PULSR comes into play. A portion of tokens have already been allocated to the community — and can be earned by anyone using the NFT search engine, or other services in the ecosystem. Meanwhile, fees are paid whenever platforms or individuals use Pulsr to boost the visibility or searchability of NFTs — with marketplaces paying a commission if sales are generated from traffic directed from the Pulsr platform. This income is then used to buy back PULSR and distribute it back to stakers. Minting partners also need to hold this token in order to access NAME for a period of time — and they’re gradually burned as the contract comes to an end. Holding PULSR brings a plethora of exclusive perks — including access to online and IRL events celebrating art, technology and Web3, along with carefully curated merch. It also unlocks the ability to suggest desired features, and vote on proposals. Meanwhile, larger token holders can offer their feedback and insights to Pulsr’s team as they continue to roll out the roadmap. The foundation features of Pulsr are open to all — but PULSR holders benefit from premium discovery features that deliver a better experience and more powerful functionality. Since news of Pulsr’s launch and token event, keen interest from Solana-based communities such as MagicEden, Madlads and more, have rallied in partnerships to crack Web3-wide NFT discovery and bring an even broader range of collections to their audience. Maxine Ryan from Pulsr added: “Our ecosystem creates a win-win-win situation. Not only do collectors find it easier to uncover pieces of digital art they’ll love and cherish forever, but talented creators can amplify the reach of their pieces like never before. Pulsr’s aggregator can also drive sales for NFT marketplaces — giving them an irresistible opportunity to reach new customers. A digital renaissance has arrived, and our search engine is designed to create a lasting record of imaginative and thought-provoking works — a library that will grow for years to come.” Pulsr is an AI-powered discovery network for NFTs that spans multiple blockchains and touches every corner of the Web3 ecosystem. Its powerful search engine allows users to find on-chain art they’ll love — whether it’s an artwork, video or song. Meanwhile, a cutting-edge system enables creators to generate detailed metadata about their collections, increasing visibility in a world of information overload.

323::https://blockworks.co/news/empire-web3-defi-tech-mainstream-institutions::Blockworks::article::The ‘next leg’ of DeFi users will be institutions, Blockchain Capital’s Larsen expects::Decentralized finance technology has been around for a while now but still hasn’t managed to attract the mainstream crowd.::DeFi innovations are aimed straight at the juggernauts, Blockchain Capital’s Larsen says Billion Photos/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks Decentralized finance technology has been around for a while now but still hasn’t managed to attract the mainstream crowd, investor Santiago Santos observes. “We’re a decade in and we have ten users in DeFi,” he quips. In today’s “we’re still so early” crypto industry, the self-deprecating “ten user” joke continues to ring true. DeFi’s relatively lackluster numbers hardly resemble what most would consider to be the “mass adoption” phenomenon that was promised years ago. The timing of the DeFi movement has been a little out of sync, Blockchain Capital general partner Aleks Larsen says, because the technology was born into an environment where the infrastructure wasn’t ready to accommodate mainstream usage. On the Empire podcast (Spotify/Apple), Larsen explains that the Ethereum network — the overloaded backbone of early DeFi innovations — “got bloated really quickly. Transaction fees were through the roof,” he says. But he insists that the DeFi thesis, at its core, “is powerful.” “These are massive markets that DeFi is going after,” Larsen notes. “That’s one of the most exciting things about crypto,” he says. “You’d expect a new technology maybe to go for niche use cases initially, but crypto goes straight for the juggernauts.” “Global permissionless financial services are,” Larsen continues, “at a very fundamental level, better suited to serve the internet economy and will grow with it.” DeFi’s mass adoption won’t necessarily look the way many imagine, Larsen says, “You’re not a daily active user of a mortgage.” Larsen says that DeFi statistics will never resemble the frenzied activity volume of a game, for example, due to the technology’s unique purpose. “But the amount of capital that the system has amassed, I would say, is quite impressive.” The retail sector drove volume in DeFi’s early days, Larsen explains, but was caught in an “unsustainable transaction fee environment” that “put a damper on adoption” just as broader attention turned to the nascent technology. Web3 infrastructure simply wasn’t ready for DeFi when it first hit the scene, but “we’re getting there now,” he says. “We’re going to have infrastructure that’s high performance, that’s cheap to use, that’s secure. And we’ve seen a lot of progress on that front.” Larsen says the industry is now waiting on the “next leg of users,” who will likely not be retail in nature. The “power users” of financial services tend to be institutional, he says. “When you think about the next leg of innovation in DeFi, derivatives come to mind for me. And these are not really retail products. These are products for sophisticated users of financial tools.”  Larsen says the movement “bleeds into tokenized markets,” with upcoming developments from massive entities like BlackRock who are “angling to enter the space.” He adds that he “wouldn’t be surprised to see them do something big in the next couple of months.” “Until then,” he concludes, “the major potential user here remains crypto degens and DAO treasuries, and perhaps forward-looking neobanks.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

This event represents the third occurrence of such a delay this year, with prior incidents noted in May. Among several instances Records from Blockchain Explorer show that block 815,689 took nearly 43 minutes to generate, and the following block, 815,690, took 66 minutes. These times are significantly longer than Bitcoin’s average block time, which is typically about 10 minutes. Colin Wu, a journalist from China, pointed out that in 2021 there were also two significant block production delays, with each lasting close to two hours. Though somewhat infrequent, these types of interruptions are not unprecedented. Tadge Dryja, creator of the Lightning Network, commented during one of the earlier setbacks that a gap of 85 minutes between blocks is expected to happen roughly every 34 days. However, his estimate does not take into account any changes in the network’s difficulty that may alter this frequency. Bitcoin mining milestones The year 2023 was particularly momentous for Bitcoin, as the network mined its 800,000th block in anticipation of its fourth halving event in April 2024. At the time of the 800,000th block, there were 867 million confirmed transactions, with an average of approximately 1,084 transactions per block, marking a significant achievement for both the cryptocurrency and its community. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

325::https://cryptobriefing.com/tether-expansion-ai-mining-edu/::Crypto Briefing::article::Tether launches new departments with fresh focus on AI, finance, Bitcoin mining and education::Tether's new framework aims for a self-sustainable, independent financial future.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Tether is establishing four new divisions focusing on data, finance, power (Bitcoin mining and energy), and education. The new ventures are part of the company’s ongoing efforts to build a more inclusive financial and technological future, Tether shared in a news release today. According to the team, the new divisions, named Tether Data, Tether Finance, Tether Power, and Tether Edu, target a wide range of services, such as data management, financial services built on blockchain technology, sustainable Bitcoin mining, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and digital education initiatives. Moving beyond its core business of offering USDT, Tether’s goal is to create financial products and services accessible to everyone, regardless of location or background. This includes building infrastructure that supports the adoption of digital assets and educating people about these new technologies. Tether said it has partnered with various institutions and initiatives to promote widespread adoption of these technologies. Notably, the company wants to use blockchain technology to create a more democratic financial system. Tether also revealed its plans to launch a digital asset tokenization platform, making it easier for people to participate in the digital asset space. Earlier this week, Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, hinted that Tether would soon launch its own tokenization platform. The platform will be completely non-custodial and customizable with multi-chain and multi-asset support. Ardoino said it would enable the tokenization of everything, from bonds, stocks, or funds to rewards points. Ardoino believes the new ventures will lead to a future-proof financial and tech ecosystem that’s accessible, sustainable, and empowering for individuals and communities worldwide. “Thriving together is in our DNA. We disrupted the traditional financial landscape with the world’s first and most trusted stablecoin. Now, we’re daring to kickstart inclusive infrastructure solutions, dismantling traditional systems for fairness,” said Ardoino. “With this evolution beyond our traditional stablecoin offerings, we are ready to build and support the invention and implementation of cutting-edge technology that removes the limitations of what’s possible in this world. We’re Tether. We use technology to empower individuals, communities, cities, and nations to become self-sustainable, independent, and free. Be unstoppable, together,” added he. Last week, Ardoino revealed that Tether’s $500 million Bitcoin mining project is close to its final stage. The investment has been used to set up mining facilities and renewable energy plants in Uruguay, Paraguay, and El Salvador. The company aims to make Bitcoin mining more decentralized. Last month, Tether officially announced its expansion into AI to address concerns about monopolizing technology development in the sector. The company will focus on developing open-source models and setting new industry standards.

326::https://theconversation.com/the-big-business-revolution-why-the-future-is-blockchain-78409::The Conversation::article::The big business revolution: why the future is blockchain::Blockchain technology is familiar to us in the form of digital currency bitcoin. And if it makes it way to the mainstream, could it change the way the world does business forever?::The value of one bitcoin recently hit a record high of US$3,025, a staggering rise of over 200% in value this year alone. Aswath Damodaran, professor of finance at the New York University, known as Wall Street’s “dean of valuation”, has said that among the younger generation, digital currencies have replaced gold as a choice of investment and that, sooner or later, currencies such as bitcoin and ethereum will compete against nation-state paper currencies. So could bitcoin become a popular currency and decrease the popularity of euros, dollars, pounds, roubles and others? For anything to be seen as “money” it needs to meet three functions – a store of value, a measure of value and a medium of exchange. Bitcoin’s volatility shows that it is an infant in meeting these three criteria, but has the potential to do so. However, digital currencies like bitcoin are just one application of the blockchain technology that makes them possible. Blockchain, as the BBC explains, is: Blockchain combines the security of cryptography, the storage and transmission of data in coded form, with peer-to-peer networks to create a shared database of transactions that is trusted, yet controlled by no one. If blockchain finds uses in various industries we could see a more digitally integrated global economy, something that could enhance economic growth and decrease poverty. In business today, we still require trusted administrators to manage and record the numbers and databases – auditors, supervisory boards and so on. The potential of blockchain is that it offers the chance to “distribute” these digital ledgers to others through a network of computers across the world. It could actually dispense with those businesses that are based on trusted relationships – such as banking, auditing, solicitors, even aspects of government. For example in Sweden, Georgia and Ukraine property registers are being moved on to the blockchain. In finance, people rarely lend directly to each other, hence the need for banks as trusted go-betweens. The beauty of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin or ethereum is that they remove the need for the trusted third party, using instead an encrypted, secure database. This has huge implications for any business that requires the verification of payments and performance of contracts – that is, most businesses. The beauty of blockchain is that something can be unique and stored digitally with ease, without needing an equivalent in the real world. For example, things like contracts, wills, deeds and share certificates might only require a piece of code stored on the blockchain that represents the exchange. Instead of a trusted intermediary verifying transactions, the computers of the shared network of bitcoin users themselves perform the verification at no cost to those involved in the transaction. This verification process holds the seeds of change across huge numbers of industries. The distributed ledger – the blockchain – offers the chance to enhance truth and trust in every system to which it is applied. It can prove who owns what at any given moment. Anything that currently exists to verify contracts, ownership, payments and even performance can be shifted to the blockchain. This would transfer power away from those who currently manage or verify transactions – a seismic change to the way the world currently operates. As with any power shift, those holding power are reluctant to surrender it. The “winners” in this scenario will come from existing companies rather than start-ups, given that for this new system to work, it requires buy-in and trust – existing brands already have this advantage. So what are blockchain’s main advantages? By performing the functions of record keepers and managers it would enhance decentralisation, reduce the amount of intermediaries involved and provide an alternative to how value can be stored. Physical as well as digital assets could be uniquely verified online to prove ownership. As transactions stored on the blockchain could be independently verified and traced, it would be easier to fight crime, counterfeiting and fraud, reducing systemic risk in the financial system. A distributed digital ledger would make it near impossible to change or falsify data, because data would have to be altered across all the related “blocks” in the digital chain, so any tampering would be exposed. Consequently associated costs would fall, enhancing economic growth and prosperity. A dramatic disruption is happening already in the financial industry: the world’s largest custodian bank, BNY Mellon, is using a blockchain based platform for government bond settlement. And one of the Bank of England’s research focus areas is based around financial technology or “fintech” and how it affects the way markets and society function. Another benefit would be to make micropayments possible digitally. A country such as India, where huge number of people still do not have access to banking, could experience profound economic change if brought within their reach, helping them save, borrow and plan for their future. The online marketing and advertising industry has feasted on data generated by internet users, and social media platforms such as Facebook – with more than two billion users – Google and Amazon collect considerable amounts of individualised data on us to target adverts at us. Blockchain could enhance our online privacy, by allowing us to store our digital footprint on our own unique blockchain and control who has access to it. Rather than these massive organisations building up records of our tastes and preferences, this data would be decentralised and within our own control. Blockchain could enhance entrepreneurship in developed and developing countries, breaking down barriers built from embedded bureaucracy and corruption by providing a means to bypass existing power structures. For example, the digital ledger Everledger is tracking a real-life object – diamonds – to prove their provenance and ownership. As a result, trust in the system is enhanced. When the internet came into being, it was a disruptive, game-changing force for many industries – blockchain technology holds the same potential. In moving trust from the current “verifiers” to a distributed blockchain system, the world could see a massive shift in power to the masses – a truly revolutionary idea.::2017-07-25T13:33:04Z::Bitcoin, Blockchain, Business, Cryptography, Currency, Digital currencies, Economic growth, Global economy ::Jukka Aminoff::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/179198/original/file-20170721-21259-1le72v2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=8%2C907%2C5991%2C2910&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
327::https://www.coindesk.com/learn/how-to-buy-solana/::CoinDesk::article::How to Buy Solana::Buying solana (SOL) is straightforward, but with numerous crypto exchanges on the market, it's crucial potential investors consider other key factors before making a purchase. Understanding Solana and SOL Choosing the right platform to buy SOL The purchasing process for buying SOL Buying Solana meme coins Securing purchased SOL::Cryptocurrency exchanges spend millions of marketing dollars convincing potential customers that purchasing solana (SOL), or any other cryptocurrency is quick and easy. They aren’t wrong. The act of purchasing cryptocurrency is quite simple. However, it is vital that potential investors have a thorough understanding of solana (SOL), the native token of the Solana blockchain, including how the Solana blockchain works and which purchase methods are best for their geographic location when designing an investment strategy. Solana is a smart contract-compatible blockchain platform that distinguishes itself from competitors with its hybrid consensus mechanism, a combination of proof-of-history and proof-of-stake. Solana’s unique consensus mechanism allows nodes, devices which validate and store transaction information on the blockchain, to process transactions without the need to communicate with one another, significantly reducing transaction processing time. With its ability to theoretically process up to 65,000 transactions per second, Solana has been dubbed by the Blockchain Council as one of the fastest and most efficient blockchains in existence. This efficiency has an impact on network fees. A network fee in the Solana ecosystem is the amount of SOL that an individual will pay to compensate node operators to process and validate their transactions. Solana’s efficiency reduces transaction costs, making it a preferred blockchain for meme coins and NFT transactions. SOL has two primary functions in the Solana ecosystem. The first function, as mentioned, is to serve as payment to node operators for processing transactions and the second is to function as a mechanism to secure the Solana network via staking. However, investors can also purchase SOL with the intention of holding, hoping that the price will increase in value against fiat currencies. There are a variety of ways in which SOL can be purchased. While crypto exchanges may convince users that buying SOL is simple and easy, the truth is that the best way to purchase the token depends on an investor's aptitude with cryptocurrencies and personal investment strategy. According to CoinMarketCap, there are over 200 different centralized cryptocurrency exchanges in existence. With so many options, it is imperative that potential SOL investors choose the right exchange for their geographic region, their investment strategies and their comfort level with keeping ownership over their own digital assets. Due to regulatory restrictions, not every cryptocurrency exchange operates in every country. It is always a good idea to check that the crypto exchange you plan to purchase SOL on is legally allowed to operate in the country you reside. There are also potential benefits to choosing a crypto exchange that is familiar with the tax and legal requirements of a specific country. For instance, crypto exchanges that operate in the United States are likely to be more familiar with IRS tax reporting requirements and provide users with both information and documentation for tax reporting purposes. You may also want to consider using a decentralized crypto exchange to buy SOL. Decentralized crypto exchanges operate without a central authority, where trades occur directly between users’ wallets and liquidity pools. Decentralized crypto exchanges use smart contracts to automate order matching and settlement. In comparison centralized crypto exchanges are operated by a company that acts as an intermediary between buyers and sellers. They manage the order book, match buy and sell orders and facilitate trading. Each platform has its benefits and drawbacks, highlighted below. To purchase SOL on a centralized exchange, first, choose a reputable crypto exchange that supports it, such as Coinbase, Binance or Kraken. Create an account by providing your email address and setting a strong password. For security, complete the identity verification process, which typically requires a photo ID. After verifying your account, secure it further by enabling two-factor authentication (like Google Authenticator). You can then deposit funds using a bank transfer, credit card or other payment methods available on the exchange. Keep in mind that centralized exchanges can charge different fees based on the method used to fund the account. Once your account is funded, navigate to the SOL trading section of the crypto exchange, select the appropriate trading pair (like SOL/USD) and execute your purchase. Always review the transaction details before executing the transaction. To buy SOL on a DEX such as Jupiter or Raydium, you will first need a wallet compatible with the Solana network. Ensure your wallet is funded with enough crypto to complete the purchase and cover the transaction fee. Connect your wallet to the DEX website; this often involves scanning a QR code or selecting a wallet connection option. Once connected, choose the trading pair that matches your funding source (e.g., SOL/USDC). Set the amount of SOL you wish to buy and check the current liquidity and slippage to ensure you receive a fair exchange rate. Confirm the transaction, and once it’s processed, the purchased SOL will appear in your wallet. Remember, trading on a DEX removes the intermediary but requires careful handling of your private keys and wallet security. According to data from Hello Moon, the number of active daily users on the Solana blockchain reached an all-time high in mid-March of 2024. The price of SOL also experienced strong bullish momentum. What caused this surge in activity? In an interview with Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko, CoinDesk’s Sam Kessler highlighted that growth in activity was due to meme coin transactions. Meme coins are digital tokens on a blockchain that are often inspired by animals, jokes or themes popular on the internet. Meme coin prices are often more volatile than other types of cryptocurrencies. The process of buying meme coins on Solana is relatively the same as purchasing SOL. However, there are extra considerations that need to be made when purchasing meme coins. Meme coins are rife with scams but the allure of a quick pay day can blind some investors to the risks. It is strongly recommended that investors interested in diving into the meme coin game thoroughly assess their personal risk tolerance and devise a sound investment strategy. Never invest more than you are willing to lose. CoinDesk also offers a thorough explainer on purchasing meme coins safely. After purchasing SOL, buyers need to protect their investment. If SOL was purchased on a centralized crypto exchange, the crypto exchange acts as custodian of the cryptocurrency and users do not need to worry about securing their private keys but accounts still need to be protected. Ensure your account is protected with a strong alphanumeric password and turn on two-factor authentication (2FA), though preferably not SMS, which lacks end-to-end encryption. It is wise to regularly update passwords. If purchased on a decentralized exchange, the buyer acts as custodian of their private keys and needs to keep them secure. Private keys can be stored in either a cold wallet that is not connected to the internet or a hot wallet that is connected to the internet. It is recommended that investors planning on holding SOL over longer periods of time store their crypto in a cold wallet, which are less vulnerable to hacks if never used to sign a transaction online. Never share your private keys with anyone, ever. Editor's Note: This article does not constitute investment advice and is not intended to invite or induce investment in solana (SOL) or any other cryptocurrency. It is meant for factual and educational purposes, with respect to certain aspects of SOL and its associated blockchain, for those who might be interested. Cryptocurrency is a high-risk investment and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong. Edited by Daniel Kuhn.

Web3 foundation Matera announced it has raised $3.6m in a strategic token round, reserved to future users of the Matera technology. Investors include Sidedoor Ventures, backers of Sui’s Mysten Labs and Polygon; OG crypto syndicates HighCass Crypto and Medusa Ventures, metaverse project The Sandbox, blockchain advisory firm Saxon Partners, APAC launchpad Enjinstarter, various KOLs as well as long term backers Gemini and Kingsway Capital. Matera aims to solve a huge problem in the creator economy: the lack of liquidity for creators to monetize. But contrary to many SocialFi projects in the space, Matera is a layer on top of existing social networks, enabling creators to compute their ‘Matera Credit score’ based on engagement on platforms they already use. They can then trade this score for liquidity and rewards in Matera’s DeFi ecosystem, which is open for other DeFi projects to connect. “No web3 SocialFi has reached major adoption because they underestimate the network effects of web2 platforms”, says Sam Huber, Matera CEO. Even if they get better economics, the switching costs are too high for Creators to start building an audience from scratch on a new platform. Matera as a bridge, enabling users to benefit from the scale of web2 and the economics of web3, solving this dilemma.” Currently, the platform supports X, and will integrate other social platforms in the near future. Users creating content on X will be able to attract stakers to support them, raise capital for their projects, and monetize their superfans. Matera will be revealing their launch platform at Token2049 in Dubai, enabling creators to sign up and start accessing the ecosystem. Over time, Matera aims to build the entire infrastructure to support 100m creators on-chain: the DeFi platform, the protocol layer, and their own Layer 2. Matera has evolved since it was first revealed about a year ago. Originally, Matera was incubated as a product of Landvault, the metaverse-as-a-service technology used by brands and Middle East governments to publish and monetize their 3D experiences. Matera evolved into a larger creator economy play, when realizing that the use case could be generalized to the entire creator economy – not just 3D worlds. In 2024, Matera was spun off from Landvault as a separate foundation, and a dedicated team formed to be full time on Matera, including Luke Gniwecki as its VP of Product (previously at Boson Protocol and Cudo Ventures) and Maxime Sebti as VP Marketing (previously as Human Protocol). Landvault remains a strategic partner for Matera, integrating the technology in government metaverse platforms across Dubai and Saudi Arabia. Matera is revolutionizing the creator economy by integrating DeFi on top of existing social media platforms. Following a successful $3.6 million seed funding, the platform is set to transform how creators capitalize on their audience, marking a significant shift in creative monetization strategies Wesbite | X | Telegram Disclaimer This article contains a press release provided by an external source and may not necessarily reflect the views or opinions of BeInCrypto.

329::https://blockworks.co/news/blockchain-asymmetric-ethereum-eclipse::Blockworks::article::Blockchain tech narrative is ‘lightyears ahead of reality,’ says Dudas::6th Man Ventures founder Mike Dudas is excited to see parallel processing on Ethereum, but “a lot has to happen before we’re going to see that."::Mike Dudas is excited to see parallel processing on Ethereum, but “a lot has to happen before we’re going to see that” Yurchanka Siarhei/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks It’s a story that spawns both bullish and bearish arguments, depending on who you ask. Previously reported at Blockworks, the Eclipse mainnet plans to use a hybrid “best of all worlds” approach — combining Solana’s speedy execution with Ethereum’s secure settlement. The idea is to take some of the best tech advantages of Solana and “tap into Ethereum’s liquidity,” Garrett Harper says on the Lightspeed podcast (Spotify/Apple). “As an open-source zealot, I am all for this,” says Asymmetric CEO Joe McCann. Being that the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) is open-source and can be applied anywhere, McCann says “that’s exactly what you should be doing.” “It’s really cool that the guys at Eclipse are taking the SVM and trying to apply it differently than its core use case today with Solana.” Read more: Eclipse is using Solana’s virtual machine to launch an Ethereum L2 McCann asserts that the broader implementation of the SVM contributes to the Lindy effect — a theoretical phenomenon whereby a technology becomes more resilient the more it is utilized. “If Eclipse is successful, what are they dependent on? The SVM. That thing has to continue to survive and exist and persist and improve and squash bugs and fix security patches and security bugs.” McCann says the news is “incredibly bullish” for Solana’s underlying technology, “because now you’re also going to be getting pressure-tested potentially in a new environment, a new set of use cases that may not actually be the core use case of the SVM today.” 6th Man Ventures founder and partner Mike Dudas cautions that Eclipse is an early stage project, noting that — as is often the case in blockchain — the narrative around the technology is “light years ahead of reality.” “I’m excited to see how parallel processing works in an Ethereum environment, but there’s just a lot that has to happen before we’re going to see that,” he says. “A lot of it is theoretical,” he says, adding, “we’ll see what happens.” McCann warns that the vision for Eclipse exhibits a “path dependency that is multi-variate.” “So many things have to go right,” he says, adding that he really hopes that it does. But Asymmetric “couldn’t get there on the investment side” during last year’s seed round, he says, “because I couldn’t size the risk of that.”  “The path-dependent nature of how this thing actually plays out has so many branches in the way that it has to succeed that it was difficult for me at the time to secure an investment.” In the long term, Dudas believes that Ethereum will exist as the largest layer-1 blockchain, at least in terms of liquidity. Solana has a chance to attract more users, he suggests, “depending on how payment use cases shake out.” “We’re early stage venture investors like Joe, and we’re underwriting a number of different early stage approaches — the majority of which won’t work out,” he says. “I just wish that the dialogue was a little less extreme about, ‘Hey, this roadmap is certainly going to work and this is the path.’” Ethereum currently holds an advantage in the amount of capital and developer talent invested in the ecosystem, Dudas says. Ethereum’s “meme of modularity” encourages people to experiment in “so many disparate ways.” “It really is actually remarkable and it’s beautiful to watch.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

Bukele, a staunch supporter of Bitcoin, garnered substantial backing from the populace on October 26, following his formal endorsement by his political party, New Ideas, to vie for a second term. Addressing a massive crowd of Salvadorans, Bukele expressed his desire for an additional five years in office, stating, “Five more [years], five more and not a single step backward. We require another five years to continue our progress in bettering our nation.” Bukele first ascended to the presidency in 2019, leading the New Ideas party to break a thirty-year stranglehold on power held by the Nationalist Republican Alliance and the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN). Nonetheless, Bukele’s candidacy has its critics. Alfonso Fajardo, an El Salvadoran lawyer, argues that the country’s constitution bars Bukele from seeking a second consecutive term, emphasizing the prohibition on immediate presidential re-election as many as seven times. He voiced this reminder on October 26, the same day Bukele received his party’s nomination. Contrary to this, in September 2021, the Supreme Court of El Salvador decreed that presidents are permitted to pursue consecutive terms in office. According to a survey conducted by a Salvadoran university and reported by Reuters, New Ideas enjoys the support of a staggering 70% of the electorate, leaving its nearest rival trailing with just 4% of the total votes. In June 2021, FMLN, one of New Ideas’ competitors, launched a legal challenge against Bukele’s Bitcoin adoption initiative, claiming it to be unconstitutional. However, their efforts were in vain as just three months later, in September 2021, Bitcoin was officially adopted as legal tender in El Salvador. Moreover, Bukele’s administration has enacted a series of tech-centric policies aimed at bolstering the nation’s economy, including the abolishment of all taxes on technological innovations. Gabor Gurbacs, a strategy advisor at VanEck, has recently expressed his belief that El Salvador has the potential to become the “Singapore of the Americas,” thanks to these initiatives. A significant portion of Bukele’s popularity can be attributed to his uncompromising crackdown on MS-13, an international gang that was a key factor in El Salvador recording the world’s highest homicide rates six years ago. Since then, the country has witnessed a remarkable 92.6% drop in its homicide rate, plummeting from 106 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2015 to just 7.8 in 2022, making it one of the safest countries in Latin America. However, this success has not come without criticism. The United Nations, among others, has accused El Salvador of violating human rights laws by detaining 65,000 individuals without granting them the legal rights necessary to defend themselves. The presidential election in El Salvador is scheduled for February 4, 2024. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

331::https://cryptobriefing.com/binance-converts-1b-emergency-fund-to-usdc/::Crypto Briefing::article::Binance converts $1B emergency fund to USDC::The fund now represents roughly 3% of USDC's total circulating supply.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Binance has converted $1 billion from its Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU) into Circle’s stablecoin USD Coin (USDC), effectively placing the fund to represent approximately 3% of the stablecoin’s total circulating supply. The SAFU was established in 2018 to protect Binance users in extreme situations, such as exchange hacks, by reimbursing them for unforeseen losses. The fund was previously held in three wallets, denominated in Bitcoin, Tether, True USD, and BNB. “We are transferring 100% of SAFU’s assets to USDC,” Binance stated, adding that the move is aimed at “making use of a trusted, audited, and transparent stablecoin,” to protect its users and enhance reliability. According to data from Etherscan, the SAFU wallet address made a transaction of 800 million USDC on Ethereum at 02:35 UTC for a transaction fee of just $1.88. The conversion process also involved a transfer of 1.36 million BNB, worth around $754 million, and 16,277 BTC. This is the second conversion of the SAFU in just over a year. In March 2023, Binance replaced the Binance USD (BUSD) holdings in the fund with Tether (USDT) and TrueUSD (TUSD) in response to a regulatory crackdown on BUSD issuer Paxos, which announced that it would stop minting the exchange-backed stablecoin. With a circulating supply of $32.6 billion, USDC is the second-largest stablecoin in the market, commanding a market share of around 20%. The stablecoin’s supply has increased by 33% since December. Tether, however, remains the dominant stablecoin, with a record-high circulating supply of $108 billion and a market share of 69%.

He replied that he did, but that it…::On July 19, Doctor Nefario, founder of the Global Bitcoin Stock Exchange, arrived at Seattle airport and was asked if he had enough money to cover his stay in the US. He replied that he did, but that it was in Bitcoin, an electronic cryptographic currency. Unfortunately, not only did the Customs and Border Protection Authority not know what Bitcoin was, they didn’t accept it as a valid currency and so refused him entry. This ignorance of Bitcoin is shared by many, even though there is currently around US$63.6 million of Bitcoin in circulation (versus approximately US$950 billion in hard cash). Bitcoin is a “cryptographic currency” that was first proposed in 2008 by a programmer using the supposed alias Satoshi Nakamoto. In early 2009, Nakamoto released software that would implement the creation, sending and receiving Bitcoins over a peer-to-peer network. His main motivation was to avoid the need for “financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments” such as a bank or PayPal. The scheme allowed the receiver to be sure the Bitcoin received was genuine and hadn’t been sent elsewhere. Nakamoto also thought Bitcoins would be largely anonymous. Although theoretically possible, the exact nature of this anonymity is still being debated and it’s clear that, to achieve it, users need to take a series of precautions. It was the anonymity of Bitcoin and its relation to an illicit online market place called Silk Road that really brought Bitcoins to the public’s and US Government’s attention. Silk Road can be used, among other things, to buy and sell drugs and other contraband. This led two US Senators to demand Silk Road be [shut down](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(bitcoin) and Bitcoin investigated. Further concern was expressed that Bitcoins could be used for money-laundering (although, given the relatively illiquid nature of the currency, this would be on a relatively small scale). The fact Bitcoin was adopted by organisations such as Wikileaks and LulzSec would not have surprised anyone. While the US authorities could bring pressure to bear on financial institutions such as Visa, Mastercard or PayPal to stop payments going to Wikileaks, there is no central authority in charge of Bitcoin, making it very much more difficult to control. Having said that, it’s not clear how much funding Wikileaks receives in the form of Bitcoins. You can get Bitcoins in two ways. The first, and most difficult, is through what is called Bitcoin mining. This involves using computers to perform some of the cryptographic operations involved in making the Bitcoin network work. If you are the first to solve the calculations, you are rewarded with a certain number of Bitcoins. A simpler way of getting Bitcoins is to buy them through one of the many Bitcoin exchanges. One such exchange is Mt Gox, which allows you to buy Bitcoins using funds transfers of ordinary cash and e-Cash. Once you’ve added funds to your account, buying Bitcoins is like buying shares: you can place an order to buy at the market rate or at a preferred rate. Once you have the Bitcoins, you can leave them in your account on the exchange. You can also transfer them to a digital wallet on your computer or to an online e-wallet service. You can then use your Bitcoins to buy goods and services ranging from books to website development to legal services. It seems clear the majority of Bitcoin is being bought and sold for investment purposes. This is another underlying cause for some of the fluctuation in rates that have beset the currency, which has seen its value go from US$1 to US $30 USD at its peak. It is currently around US $10. The underlying system of transferring Bitcoin may be secure enough, but Bitcoin suffers from a number of vulnerabilities that have led to widely-publicised problems in the Bitcoin universe. One of the first Bitcoin incidents occurred in June 2011 when Mt Gox was hacked and the user database of 61,000 users was taken. The hackers used those usernames and passwords to transfer 25,000 Bitcoins – approximately US$225,000 – to an account. From there, they then tried to sell them on, but succeeded in only removing about $1,000-worth because of the daily limit imposed by Mt Gox. As a consequence of the hack, the exchange rate for Bitcoin on Mt Gox plummeted before climbing back to the pre-hack level. The second event was when another Bitcoin service, MyBitcoin.com, was hacked resulting in the site closing down along with all of the account holders’ Bitcoins. Approximately US$2 million of Bitcoin (valuation at the time) was lost, with one account holder who helped promote the site to family and friends losing about $250,000. And then there was Bitomat, another Bitcoin site. Based in Poland, a technical error on the part of the operator caused the server to crash, losing access to the Bitcoins in the process. Mt Gox has recently taken over the accounts of Bitomat and offered to refund the lost coins to those users to help ensure the continuation of Bitcoin. The “idea” of Bitcoin clearly has resonance with certain groups of people. An electronic currency free from mediation and interference of governments and corporations, and which can be anonymous, is ideal for groups operating on the fringes of society – activists (cyber or otherwise), libertarians and, yes, criminals. Whether the implementation of Bitcoin as it currently stands survives or it’s ultimately replaced by a variant will depend on how many other things go wrong, and also on the development of more robust and easy to use software. Certainly, the recent Bitcoin events are growing pains in comparison to the fall out of the Global Financial Crisis and what countries, companies and individuals have lost as a result of a largely self-regulated financial industry. Ironically, Bitcoin may end up being more resistant to national and corporate manipulation and possibly more robust as a result. Still, if you’re going to use Bitcoins, do so carefully and with small amounts of money that you can afford to lose. A version of this article appeared on David Glance’s blog Tech Muse.

333::https://www.coindesk.com/learn/a-beginners-guide-to-ai-tokens/::CoinDesk::article::A Beginner’s Guide to AI Tokens::AI tokens will play an integral role in the adoption of machine learning models in the blockchain industry. Understanding AI Crypto Tokens How Do AI Tokens Work? Top 5 AI Tokens Final Words::Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming many industries, and the crypto space is no exception. With this convergence of blockchain and AI, we’re seeing the rise of unique digital assets; AI crypto tokens. In this beginner’s guide to AI tokens, we will explain what they are, how they work, and list some of the most prominent AI cryptocurrencies in the market. This is partner content sourced from Laura Shin’s Unchained and published by CoinDesk. AI tokens are cryptocurrencies that support AI-based projects, applications, and services within the blockchain ecosystem. AI tokens play three pivotal roles; the first is facilitating transactions. They are the medium of exchange within AI-powered platforms. With them, users can pay for services, access data, and participate in the platform’s activities. Additionally, they are crucial in enabling protocol governance. Some of these tokens confer governance rights to their holders, empowering holders to participate in decision-making processes shaping the development and direction of the AI project or platform. Finally, they incentivize users to contribute towards the growth of the AI protocol/project. These may receive rewards in tokens for contributing data, providing computational resources, or developing AI applications. AI crypto tokens typically work in the following ways: Specifics can vary widely depending on the project. Each AI token system is designed with its own rules and purposes. The crypto AI landscape is rapidly evolving, and many projects are coming up to address various aspects of the space. Here are the top five leading AI tokens measured by market capitalization. The Injective Chain is a layer-2 decentralized exchange and derivatives trading platform powered by the INJ token. It enables advanced trading tools like margins/leverage, using AI for optimized order execution, strategy testing, and predictive analytics. At the time of writing, INJ was the biggest AI token with a market cap of $1.418B. The Graph (GRT) is an indexing protocol for organizing blockchain data, allowing for its easy querying for AI analytics. GRT is the second-largest AI token by market cap ($1.379B at the time of writing) and coordinates the decentralized network of nodes (Indexers). These earn the rights to index and serve application data by staking their GRT. Render Token enables a decentralized GPU cloud computing network for high-demand AI/ML training/rendering tasks. Users stake and lock up RNDR for access to GPUs. The project rewards Render Farm suppliers in RNDR for leasing out graphics horsepower capacity. RNDR has a market cap of $1.22B at the time of writing. The Theta token (THETA) powers the Theta decentralized video delivery network and is the fourth largest AI and big data token, with a market cap of $960M at the time of writing. It aims to provide improved video streaming quality and reduced costs through AI and ML innovations. Users and relay nodes earn THETA for sharing bandwidth resources. The Oasis Network uses a token-incentivized architecture to enable privacy-preserving AI computations on blockchain. ROSE tokens, which have a market cap of $567M at the time of writing, coordinate the network of nodes, providing secure computing via technologies like Intel SGX, differential privacy, and federated learning. As blockchain platforms aim for large-scale adoption, AI innovations will be critical for unlocking new capabilities and efficiencies. Specialized AI tokens help coordinate the incentives and collaboration necessary for advancing AI in a decentralized context. These have strong potential as the tokenization of ML processes grows on-chain. But the category remains technically complex and volatile, as with most crypto. Therefore, investor due diligence before their adoption remains vital. Disclosure Please note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.

Users can now query data from Avalanche, Arbitrum, Cronos, Ethereum Goerli, Fantom, Near, Optimism, Polkadot, Polygon, Polygon Mumbai and Tron, according to a Thursday blog post. Google called these blockchains “in-demand” and says that users can now retrieve information about “the flow of assets from one wallet to another, which tokens are most popular, and how users are interacting with smart contracts.” It also said that customers are often asking things like how many NFTs were minted on specific chains or how transaction fees compare across chains. Read more: Google loosens ad guidelines for NFT game providers Google added that having more access to a wider array of networks can help curious individuals answer questions like those “without the overhead of operating nodes or maintaining an indexer.” Back in 2018, Google’s cloud segment added support for Bitcoin and Ethereum on BigQuery. And with the advent of ordinals, essentially Bitcoin NFTs, coming to the network in January 2023, Google is also now allowing developers to query satoshis and/or ordinals from the Bitcoin dataset on BigQuery. Previously, in 2019, six other chains were added to BigQuery beyond the big two, including Bitcoin Cash, Dash, Dogecoin, Ethereum Classic, Litecoin, and Zcash. Google’s commitment to advancing blockchain isn’t limited to maintaining large blockchain datasets. Blockworks previously reported that Google Cloud has become an oracle operator for LayerZero, a cross-chain messaging protocol.

The potential release […]::On a global scale, the United States government has become a significant holder of Bitcoin (BTC), accumulating a substantial stash of around 200,000 BTC as a result of legal actions targeting cybercriminals and activities in the hidden corners of the internet. These holdings currently have an estimated value of roughly $5.4 billion. The potential release of these digital assets into the market has raised concerns about potential disruptions, a situation made more complex by the U.S. government’s relatively hands-off approach to cryptocurrency markets. Reports from The Wall Street Journal have shed light on the fact that the U.S. government is not actively engaging in speculation on the future value of its Bitcoin (BTC) holdings or participating in day-to-day trading. Instead, these BTC assets are caught up in a complex and lengthy legal process. Jarod Koopman, the executive director of the IRS’s cyber and forensics services section, emphasized, “Our approach does not involve speculating on the market. Our actions are guided by the timelines established in our protocols.” If the U.S. government decides to sell its Bitcoin holdings, it could have a significant impact on the market, causing concerns among investors and potentially leading to a decrease in BTC value. However, it’s important to recognize that the bureaucratic procedures required to secure approval for such a sale are known for their lengthy nature. When a government agency seizes digital assets, it’s crucial to understand that immediate ownership doesn’t occur. Ownership is transferred only after a court issues a final forfeiture order. Following this, the forfeited assets are entrusted to the U.S. Marshals Service, which takes responsibility for liquidating these seized digital assets. Nicolas Christin, a professor specializing in computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, explains, “The government’s processes for disposing of assets tend to move slowly, as thorough due diligence is essential. Cases are often complex, and substantial bureaucratic procedures must be navigated.” In a notable development earlier this year, the U.S. government successfully sold approximately $215 million worth of BTC confiscated from the Silk Road marketplace. Furthermore, it was revealed that the government had plans to divest an additional 41,490 BTC, valued at an impressive $1.1 billion. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

337::https://cryptobriefing.com/a16z-7b-venture-strat-ai-gaming-web3/::Crypto Briefing::article::a16z raises $7.2B for venture strategies, pushes for AI and Web3 gaming::N/A::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) has raised $7.2 billion for five of its venture strategies, as disclosed by Ben Horowitz in a blog post. The funds were raised for American Dynamism, Games, Apps, Infrastructure, and Growth, with the largest raise being $3.75 billion for the Growth strategy. Notably, Games and American Dynamism were allocated $600 million each. While the specific allocation of the freshly raised funds remains unclear, a16z’s Games venture has previously expressed interest in Web3 gaming. According to statements from the venture’s website, a16z is committed to the idea that games are driving innovation across the consumer ecosystem, opening new opportunities for “user engagement, retention, and monetization” as seen through “microtransactions, battle passes and Web3 tokens.” Although crypto was not among the firm’s initial moves, a report from Bloomberg indicates that the firm is “still on track to raise additional funds” by 2025. This aligns with a report from October 2023, which speculated that the venture capital firm was eyeing $3.4 billion for some of its funds and that new investing vehicles could come in 2025. “This marks an important milestone for us,” Horowitz shared in the recent blog post. A16z has been actively investing and leading rounds in the crypto industry. In late March, the firm announced that it had selected 25 start-ups for its spring 2024 crypto startup accelerator, offering each firm a $500,000 investment in exchange for 7% equity. Outside of its accelerator, a16z has continued to support crypto projects. The venture capital firm recently led a Series B funding round for Espresso Systems, a rollup-focused Ethereum infrastructure project. Commenting on the firm’s support for Espresso Systems, a16z general partner Ali Yahya said: “At its core, crypto is a technology movement that builds tools for better human cooperation at a larger scale — especially when the cooperating parties mutually distrust one another.” Earlier in February, the venture capital firm also made a $100 million investmen for EigenLayer’s Series B funding round.

338::https://theconversation.com/the-blockchain-could-have-better-security-than-the-banks-80748::The Conversation::article::The blockchain could have better security than the banks::Providing security in the blockchain would convert into a degree of predictability in the technology. If this was shown to work in the long term, it would also create trust.::There are ways to improve the online ledger blockchain by taking some security notes from banks. If people could use both two-step verification and spending limits on the blockchain, this would reduce any economic loss from cyber attacks and in turn encourage more users. The blockchain is a global network of computers that run the same blockchain software. Transactions on the blockchain are currently limitless and there is no one governing body. Introducing security measures could demonstrate a level of predictability in the blockchain that could build more trust. At the moment there are third-party sites that perform transactions with the blockchain on your behalf. They are owned and managed separately from the blockchain itself, and this presents a single point of failure. These sites, like Kraken, Changelly and Shapeshift, allow people to purchase, as well as exchange, blockchain assets. Activity on these sites includes purchasing Bitcoin with US dollars or exchanging Bitcoin for Ethereum assets. The blockchain ecosystem is by no means perfect. Many people shy away from using it due to its perceived volatility. There is no “code of conduct” protocol for the blockchain at the moment and it’s likely there never will be. In addition, creating and maintaining blockchain software is arduous and managed by only a few people globally. These software developers, who are the trailblazers of this technology, are being disadvantaged by constantly being forced to respond to malicious attacks. There have been many malicious attacks on the blockchain including the very recent attack on a third-party online wallet. In this attack, an unknown user was able to hijack the third-party site and redirect all transactions to their account. These and other malicious attacks have made blockchain assets either temporarily unavailable or permanently unrecoverable. It’s for these reasons that the solution to secure the blockchain can’t be owned and managed by third-parties, and must be part of the blockchain itself. Security measures like the ones we’re proposing may reduce the severity and speed of any malicious attacks. Lowering the bounty for malicious attacks could also prove to be a disincentive for this behaviour. The mechanisms we use to build trust in the traditional financial institutions could be coded into the blockchain. It’s unlikely that a blockchain user will use the technology to spend 100% of the assets in their account, with no notice whatsoever. This is why hacks of these accounts are so obvious, just as they would be if your bank account was suddenly drained. Adjustable spend and transaction limits currently protect mainstream bank account users from one malicious transaction. There is no reason the same kind of consumer protection cannot apply to cryptocurrency users. In order for this to work, the blockchain needs to verify that you are the legitimate user of the account, who is wanting to raise and lower spending limits for the purpose of transferring funds. We propose this could work via voice authentication. This is where a blockchain user performs a transaction on the blockchain and is subsequently prompted to provide a single-use vocal passphrase – this is the second step in the two-step verification process. This would be similar to the program Captcha, but with one unique twist. Captcha is designed to discern legitimate users of the internet from online robots. It works by generating a one-time image of letters and numbers that the user has to type correctly to proceed. Captcha can verify if you are human, but is unable to verify your individual identity. Using the human voice with this type of technology could be more commonplace in the future. It’s also less complex than other types of biometric verification, which require sophisticated infrastructure such as retina- and iris-scanning hardware. More importantly, the human voice shares blockchain attributes. Your voice and your public blockchain key are both public and unique. At present there is no guarantee of holding blockchain assets without disruption of some kind. Providing security in the blockchain would convert into a degree of predictability in the technology. If this was shown to work in the long term, it would also create trust. Obviously, we trust traditional currencies. For example, laws provide a promise that a $20 note will result in a mutual exchange of goods and services to that value. So once a degree of predictability is established in a blockchain, there will also be new business opportunities from traditional markets, such as insurance in case of sudden undue economic loss. It’s in the interests of the majority stakeholders of blockchain to consistently look for responses and improvements that reduce the limitations of the technology. A malicious attack, intent on bringing down the architecture of blockchain technology, would unfairly relegate the blockchain to a history as another ponzi scheme.::2017-07-16T19:58:38Z::Banking, Bitcoin, Blockchain, Currencies, Hacking, Security, Technology::Luke van der Laan::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/178196/original/file-20170714-14242-1tcyehh.gif?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

What Are Bitcoin Whales? How Do Whales Influence the Market? Three Ways to Spot a Bitcoin Whale Biggest Bitcoin Whales in the Market::Bitcoin whales can significantly impact the price of bitcoin when they decide to buy or sell BTC in large quantities, making them some of the most important Bitcoin market participants. Read on to learn more about bitcoin whales, how they influence the market, and how you can spot them. This is partner content sourced from Laura Shin’s Unchained and published by CoinDesk. Bitcoin whales are individuals or entities holding large amounts of the digital currency and have the potential to impact price movements with a single trade. The widely accepted minimum threshold for a bitcoin whale is 1,000 BTC. The term “bitcoin whale” is a colloquial phrase to put the size of the holding in perspective when compared to other “smaller fish” in the market. The wallet owner can be an individual or a group pooling resources to make significant investments. Whales’ position as the biggest players in the Bitcoin market makes them highly influential. Their significant holdings allow them to significantly affect bitcoin’s immediate demand or supply on exchanges (or via OTC trading desks) whenever they trade. As a result, the market often responds with price movements. The price of bitcoin often rallies when a while decides to add to their bitcoin position due to the size of their trades. Conversely, if a Bitcoin whale opts to exit their position by selling a portion of their holdings, the price tends to respond with a decline. Moreover, a lot of whales’ wallets are publicly tracked, which results in the wider Bitcoin trading community responding to whale’s trading decisions (or expected trades), often resulting in a large price movement as many traders mirror the whale’s (expected) trade. Consequently, some whales prefer trading with others directly via OTC trading desks to limit their impact on the price. However, some whales trading on exchanges may take the opportunity to move the market in the direction they want by signaling to the market that they are a large buyer or seller. Knowing how to spot a Bitcoin whale can be a helpful addition to your Bitcoin trading arsenal, given its potential to impact the market with a simple buy or sell order. Let’s look at three ways you can spot a Bitcoin whale. According to this bitcoin whales chart, as of July 2023, there are 2,018 BTC wallets with balances of over 1,000 BTC. Some notable whales have held onto their bitcoin for the long term. Let’s look at five of the most notable, publicly known bitcoin whales. Spotting a bitcoin whale’s activities can help you make shrewd moves in the market. However, remember that even whales can make emotional decisions without rationality. Some may even seek to manipulate the market to benefit themselves. Ensure you go beyond tracking their activities and find their reasons before making decisions.

The South Korean city sits at the southeastern tip of the peninsula and has started to become something of a blockchain hub of the country. The purpose of the urban blockchain is to unify all the various blockchain services currently offered on chains such as Ethereum and Cosmos onto a single citywide platform, News1 reported. One well publicized use case is an identity management program called BPASS. Busan and Coinplug pioneered the program, which uses decentralized identifiers (DID) so residents can anonymously authenticate themselves when applying for public or private services. BPASS users can store their driver’s license, library card and even university graduation certificates on mobile devices. There was no timeline given for the upcoming Busan blockchain, but the city plans for it to be public and interoperable with Ethereum and Cosmos. Read more: South Korea passes crypto legislation to crack down on ‘illegal trading practices’ A city digital asset exchange, initially announced sometime in January 2023, is also part of Busan’s recent blockchain push. The exchange is set to debut tokenized precious metals and raw materials, with full-scale operations launching in the first half of 2024. The corporation overseeing the exchange will launch in November 2023, following a public offering in October. News1 reported that crypto assets won’t be available for trade initially, but there are plans to expand tradable assets to global intellectual property rights, carbon emissions and tokenized securities. To support all of this new building in the sector, Busan also announced a blockchain innovation fund.

According to an October 14 update from an inside source cited by Bloomberg, the SEC has decided not to appeal the decision made by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in August. This court ruling argued that the SEC had made a mistake in rejecting Grayscale’s application for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. This case has garnered significant attention in the financial industry, as various players have been competing for approval to launch spot Bitcoin ETFs. The SEC’s unexpected decision to step aside might pave the way for a thorough review of Grayscale’s ETF proposal. Grayscale, a major investment firm, has put forth an ETF designed to provide exposure to Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s leading cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, without requiring direct ownership. Previously, the SEC had denied all spot Bitcoin ETF applications, including Grayscale’s, claiming that the applicants couldn’t sufficiently protect investors from potential market manipulation. The situation escalated when Grayscale challenged the SEC’s decision in court, arguing that the surveillance mechanisms previously approved to combat fraudulent activities in Bitcoin futures-based ETFs should also be applicable to their proposed spot ETF. The appeals court upheld Grayscale’s position, stating that the SEC had failed to clarify the significant differences between the two setups. It is expected that instructions on how to implement the court’s decision will be issued, likely directing the SEC to reevaluate Grayscale’s application. This development could also have implications for other financial giants, such as BlackRock and Fidelity, which have similar spot Bitcoin ETF applications pending. With the SEC expected to make decisions on these applications by 2024 at the latest, the landscape for cryptocurrency-based financial products may be on the verge of a significant transformation. As of the time of writing, neither Grayscale nor the SEC had issued any comments on this development. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

343::https://cryptobriefing.com/roaringkitty-comeback-market-surge/::Crypto Briefing::article::Meme coin supercycle or liquidity crisis? Expert discusses RoaringKitty's return::Eneko Knörr, CEO and co-founder of Stabolut believes that the resurfacing of the legendary investor might favor the crypto market. A possible meme coin supercycle::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article After a nearly two-year hiatus, the trader known as RoaringKitty returned to social media on May 13. Keith Gill, the real identity of RoaringKitty, is largely credited for spiking the GameStop stock (GME) surge in late 2020, and his return was enough to make GME price jump nearly 147% in 24 hours. Moreover, following his first publication, Gill started sharing cryptic videos that attracted the attention of known crypto investors, such as Ansem. This formed a landscape that is seen by the trader who identifies himself as EllioTrades as a preparation for a ‘meme coin super cycle.’ However, some investors from the crypto community manifested their worries about movements in traditional finance being capable of draining liquidity from crypto. Eneko Knörr, CEO and co-founder of Stabolut, shared with Crypto Briefing that the crypto market’s liquidity is unlikely to be substantially affected. “On the contrary, it feels like the meme stocks comeback has brought back attention to meme coins, with PEPE trading at a striking all-time high, for instance. This parallel surge in both meme stocks and meme coins indicates that the enthusiasm generated by RoaringKitty’s return is not limited to a single market, but rather is a broader phenomenon that transcends traditional boundaries,” explained Knörr. Furthermore, Stabolut’s co-founder believes that the crypto market is well-equipped to absorb and respond to such shifts in investor sentiment, another sign that the liquidity will remain robust in crypto. “In fact, the overlap between the meme stock and crypto communities may even lead to a cross-pollination of ideas and investment strategies, further fueling the growth of both markets.” Knörr highlights the impact influencers and key opinion leaders (KOL) have on the crypto industry, mentioning Max Keiser and Kris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com, as examples. Their voices, he adds, can shape market sentiment. Therefore, RoaringKitty’s return combined with interactions with notable crypto investors has the potential to trigger a meme coin supercycle. “The evolution of KOLs has led to a budding economy where influencers not only promote projects but also invest in them, often under favorable terms of course. This shift has raised concerns about transparency and potential conflicts of interest, as many KOLs fail to disclose their financial ties to the projects they promote. Despite these concerns, the influence of KOLs on the crypto market is undeniable, with research suggesting that they can significantly impact token prices and market trends.” The impact mentioned by Stabolut’s co-founder is even more significant when it comes to meme coins, which often thrive on the enthusiasm and participation of influencers’ followers, and the endorsement of a prominent influencer can be a significant catalyst for their growth.

344::https://theconversation.com/bitcoins-central-appeal-could-also-be-its-biggest-weakness-80486::The Conversation::article::Bitcoin’s central appeal could also be its biggest weakness::Bitcoin’s central appeal of anonymous, irreversible transactions could become its biggest weakness.::Bitcoin reached a huge new peak in value in June 2017, when one unit of the virtual currency was worth US$2,851 (£2,208), up from around US$600 just a year earlier. More than 10m people worldwide are now thought to own bitcoin and more than 100,000 merchants accept it for goods (not counting all those using it to sell drugs and other illegal items on the black market). Part of bitcoin’s appeal for many of its users is the lack of centralised control or regulation by any government or bank. Instead it relies on a technology known as blockchain to underpin and secure transactions. But research my colleagues and I have conducted suggests that the lack of any social trust in the way blockchain operates poses a challenge for bitcoin’s further spread. Blockchain is a public database that records digital transactions. These are validated by computers working within a worldwide network that solve complex coded problems. Whereas traditional bank transactions are authorised by financial institutions and controlled by governments through taxation and contracts between parties with known identities, blockchain is decentralised, unregulated and anonymous. In our studies of blockchain’s users we found that these features appeal to bitcoin users because of increasing distrust of financial institutions and governments. The technology empowers people to regain control over their money, with no restrictions over where and when they can send it. But our findings also indicate that two core aspects of blockchain’s design – the fact that transactions are anonymous and irreversible – pose significant challenges to the social trust among its users. Anonymity has an obvious appeal for people looking to avoid government control. And irreversible transactions were built into blockchain’s original design as a positive feature to address banks’ privilege of reversing transactions, even when the contract states that they were final. But in practice, these features are a problem for many people. Most people are used to relying on the reputation of a seller to decide whether or not to buy from them – and the ability of the financial and legal system to help them if something goes wrong. But neither of these things are possible through blockchain. Most transactions don’t just involve moving bitcoin from one electronic wallet to another. In practice, they are often part of a larger, two-way transactions where both parties send and receive assets such as bitcoins, real world currency or physical goods. The issue is that the blockchain only records the movement of bitcoin, not the movement of other currencies or goods. Because there is no authority to complain to, this raises a major risk that users could fall prey to dishonest traders who fail to deliver their side of the deal. In our latest study, we interviewed 20 bitcoin users recruited from five online groups from Malaysia, most of them with more than two years experience of using bitcoins. Our research indicates that more than 50% of participants would prefer blockchain’s transactions to be regulated and identifiable, so that transactions can be either reversed or the dishonest trader legally sanctioned. This shows there is a tension between the freedom and empowerment of blockchain’s unregulated nature, and the lack of security that most people are accustomed to receiving from traditional financial institutions. If this is not addressed, such tension may limit the spread of bitcoin beyond its current base. It could even reduce the number of bitcoin users involved in such two-way transactions, as more people become aware of the risks of dishonest traders. In contrast, the use of blockchain for one-way transactions such as remittance payments will continue to grow, as they are less affected by dishonest traders. Even bitcoin’s current users still operate largely under the traditional mindset of centralised and regulated currencies. Bitcoin advocates may need to find ways to encourage users to develop a new mental approach to unregulated blockchain technology. But developers could also build tools to address some of bitcoin users’ concerns. For example, there may be a way to record whether the real-world elements of bitcoin transactions are also verified, authorised and stored on the public ledger. Electronic wallets could be linked to a reputation file that users could view before agreeing to a deal, much like sites such as eBay allow consumers to rate sellers. And new mechanisms built on top of the irreversible blockchain protocol could enable individual two-way transactions to be reversed. Without doing something to tackle these challenges, the very thing that caught people’s attention about bitcoin in the first place could end up stifling its growth and eventually consigning it to history.::2017-07-07T11:01:48Z::Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, Fintech, Online anonymity, Virtual currencies::Corina Sas::Home::https://images.theconversation.com/files/177299/original/file-20170707-3005-1psg20m.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C363%2C4961%2C2406&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
345::https://www.coindesk.com/learn/bitcoin-name-service-bns-explained-a-guide-to-btc-domains/::CoinDesk::article::Bitcoin Name Service (BNS) Explained: A Guide to .BTC Domains::Bitcoin Name Service (BNS) domains provide Bitcoin web3 users with human-readable .btc names for their wallets. What Is the Bitcoin Name Service? How Do .BTC Domains Work? How to Buy Bitcoin Domains::Bitcoin Name Service (BNS) enable crypto users to have an easily identifiable, human-readable .btc domain name linked to their Web3 wallet, increasing the user-friendliness of their Bitcoin Web3 experience. This guide looks at Bitcoin Name Service (BNS), how .btc domains work, and how to buy a .btc domain. This is partner content sourced from Laura Shin’s Unchained and published by CoinDesk. Bitcoin Name Service is a decentralized naming database secured on the Bitcoin blockchain that supplies Web3 usernames registered by Stacks. BNS is the Web3 phonebook and provides a mapping between human-readable host names such as unchained.btc to cumbersome alphanumerical wallet addresses. BNS shares a similar purpose to the Web2 Domain Name System (DNS). It provides an interface to buy, register, manage, and look up domain names. The two systems may fulfill the same need but differ in structure and architecture. Where DNS depends on centralized servers, BNS runs on peer-to-peer server systems that are secure and censorship-resistant. BNS names have three properties: universally unique, human-meaningful, and strongly owned. The Bitcoin Name System leverages the security and resilience of the Bitcoin network to facilitate a seamless user experience for Bitcoin Web3 users within the Stacks ecosystem, allowing users to send and receive STX as well as Stacked-based tokens and NFTs. A .btc domain is a specific type of blockchain name registered and stored on the Bitcoin network as an NFT. The .btc domains are held on the BNS and registered through a smart contract on Stacks. The domains utilize Bitcoin’s security features and implement Clarity smart contracting language to create a decentralized name registry. Ownership of every .btc name is documented on the Bitcoin blockchain as a hash. Every domain and subdomain on BNS has Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) that provide an eternal identifier for public keys and is compatible with other systems that use DIDs. .BTC names are organized into a global name hierarchy in three layers; namespaces, BNS names, and BNS subdomains. You can register .btc names through a transaction with the BNS smart contract on Stacks. The smart contract ensures that BNS domains are synchronized and replicated to all other Stacks nodes worldwide. Before getting a .btc domain, you’ll need a wallet that supports .btc domains, such as Hiro Wallet or Xverse. You will also need STX in your wallet to purchase a Bitcoin domain on BNS. New domains cost 2 STX. These costs don’t include transaction fees. You can buy STX from an exchange and send it to your Stacks-compatible wallet. The steps to buying a Bitcoin domain are as follows; Go to https://btc.us/ and write the name you want to register in the search bar on the landing page. A pop-up will tell you whether the name is available, the rates you’ll pay in STX, and how long you’ll have it (5 years for 2 STX). Once you’ve confirmed the name is available, you must create a Bitcoin-connected Stacks account to start the purchase. Connect your Stacks-compatible wallet to the site to log in. Once you’re logged in, you will get a prompt to purchase the .btc domain you chose. Send in the 2 STX, and you’ll own the domain for five years. The transaction will incur a small gas fee. After the transaction is complete, the Bitcoin domain name will appear in your Stacks wallet. You can also buy a second-hand Bitcoin domain in secondary marketplaces. BNS names give people unique web3 identities and make it easier to complete transactions without making any errors.

Bitcoin [BTC] surprised investors last week as its price rallied by double digits. The trend sparked excitement in the market as expectations of BTC reclaiming $70k increased. In fact, if the latest data is to be considered, this possibility doesn’t seem to be a long shot. CoinMarketCap’s data revealed that BTC’s price rallied by more than 10% in the last seven days, allowing it to sit above $67k.  At the time of writing, the king of cryptos was trading at $67,115.81 with a market capitalization of over $1.32 trillion. While BTC’s price action favored the bulls, Titan of Crypto, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet highlighting an interesting development. As per the tweet, BTC was targeting the upper line of its realized price. If this translates into reality, then investors might witness BTC run above $100k in the coming weeks. The possibility of that happening was likely, as similar episodes happened in the past. To be precise, Bitcoin has touched the upper line of its realized price during each and every cycle in the past. Things in terms of on-chain metrics also looked pretty optimistic for Bitcoin. AMBCrypto’s analysis of CryptoQuant’s data revealed BTC’s net deposit on exchanges was dropping, hinting at low selling pressure. Its MPI was green, meaning that miners were selling fewer holdings compared to its one-year average. However, at press time, BTC’s aSORP was red, suggesting that more investors were selling at a profit. In the middle of a bull market, it can indicate a market top. Source: CryptoQuant Apart from aSORP, a few other metrics also raised red flags. For instance, AMBCrypto’s analysis of Glassnode’s data revealed that BTC’s accumulation trend score had a value of 0.0107. The accumulation trend score is an indicator that reflects the relative size of entities that are actively accumulating coins on-chain in terms of their BTC holdings. A value closer to 0 means that investors are distributing or not accumulating BTC. Source: Glassnode Apart from this, BTC’s fear and greed index had a value of 72. This meant that the market was in a “greed” phase, which often results in price corrections. So, AMBCrypto analyzed BTC’s daily chart to see which direction it was headed in the short-term. We found that BTC was testing its resistance at the $67.3k mark at press time. Likewise, its price remained above its 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-25 Additionally, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) also registered an uptick, suggesting that BTC might flip its resistance into its support. If that happens, then things will remain bullish in the near term. Nonetheless, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) went southward, hinting at a price correction soon.

Yet while transferring and storing value remain its primary functions, crypto inscriptions have introduced broader applications for the Bitcoin network. Inscriptions allow users to store data directly on the blockchain, such as images, audio, videos, and more. Even though this started with Ordinals on Bitcoin, inscriptions have spread to other networks, attracting a mixture of curiosity and concern among community members. This guide covers crypto inscriptions, their history, how they work, and the benefits and drawbacks they bring to decentralized ecosystems. BeinCrypto tested the top exchanges to purchase inscriptions over a period of six months. The criteria for the top platforms included fees, reputation, safety, products and services, and features. OKC, Gate.io, and Binance reflect the qualities seen in the top inscriptions platforms. Here’s why we chose each platform. Gate.io Gate.io is a global exchange that has low fees, a vast array of products and services, and wide availability for customers in various countries. Alongside inscriptions, customers can also stake, mine, trade derivatives, and a multitude of other activities. Binance As the world’s largest exchange by trading volume, Binance customers can enjoy low fees and tight spreads. In addition to its inscriptions services, customers can also trade spot, NFTs, futures, optons, on margin, and with trading bots. OKX OKX is an expansive exchange that allows users to not only trade crypto at low fees, but also use earn products, trade derivatives and spot, use trading bots, and trade on margin. Users can also trade peer-to-peer or or trade NFTs. To learn more about BeInCrypto’s Verification Methodology, navigate to the following webpage. Gate.io is an expansive cryptocurrency exchange that serves a global suite of users. On the platform customers can enjoy low trading fees, a wide variety of cryptocurrencies (including inscriptions and Runes), NFT trading, futures trading, and more. OKX boasts a large marketplace for inscriptions. Users can inscribe, exchange, and manage inscriptions, doginals, ordinals, and atomicals for free. Along with its wide range of products, OKX is well-known for its earn products, derivatives, and NFTs. Binance is the world’s largest exchange by trading volume. It has some of the lowest fees, a wide selection of crypto to choose from including inscriptions, and an assortment of products and services. Users can even take advantage of its proprietary BNB blockchain for developing or using decentralized applications (DApps). In the case of Bitcoin, inscriptions are metadata added to individual satoshis (sats), the smallest unit of BTC. Inscriptions arise from people inscribing sats with arbitrary content, creating Bitcoin-native digital artifacts. The rise of Ordinal inscriptions on Bitcoin occurred when Casey Rodarmor, a Bitcoin developer, created the Ordinals protocol, which launched in January 2023. The Ordinals protocol — made possible by the Taproot and SegWit upgrades — uses Ordinal Theory to number, identify, and track sats, allowing Bitcoin to support the creation and trading of tokens. When sats are inscribed, they can be transferred through Bitcoin transactions, directed to Bitcoin addresses, and stored within unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs). However, you’ll need an address that can receive Ordinals, as standard BTC addresses won’t work here. While Bitcoin Ordinals became popular in January 2023, the concept of non-interchangeable tokens on Bitcoin was not new. In the traditional Bitcoin framework, all Bitcoins were treated as equal. However, in 2012, so-called colored coins emerged as a method to represent and manage real-world assets on the Bitcoin blockchain. This allowed Bitcoin’s utility to expand beyond being a peer-to-peer currency. However, the additional “non-financial” data increased demand for block space, which strained Bitcoin nodes. Colored coins used “metadata injection” to add metadata. However, the method was inefficient and had capacity limitations. To address this, the Bitcoin community introduced the OP_RETURN function in 2014 as part of the Bitcoin Core 0.9.0 release. This function enabled users to “store” arbitrary data on a Bitcoin transaction output, preserving it within the Bitcoin block space. In 2017, the segregated witness (SegWit) update was activated on Bitcoin. Before SegWit, the OP_RETURN function stored arbitrary data within the transaction block, along with existing details such as the sender or receiver’s address, the transaction time, etc., on Bitcoin. SegWit separated signature information from transaction data, helping to optimize block space and making transactions cheaper. In 2021, the Taproot upgrade expanded upon SegWit’s foundation by introducing Schnorr signatures, which were more efficient, secure, and smaller, contributing to the overall reduction in transaction size. These advancements enable transactions to accommodate larger metadata payloads, resulting in faster processing times and reduced transaction costs. Introduced in January 2023 by Casey Rodarmor, Ordinal Theory was built upon its preceding developments. This made the creation of Bitcoin-native assets simpler. Ordinal Theory describes the systematic ordering of satoshis and the inscription of data onto them using the Ordinal protocol. Ordinals are satoshi’s numerical system, allowing tracking and data transfer. These designations, referred to as Ordinal numbers, are assigned to satoshis based on the sequential order in which they are mined. Users could now trade Bitcoin NFTs directly on the blockchain. With the creation of Ordinals, users can now inscribe content such as videos, images, text, PDFs, and audio onto individual satoshis. Shortly after introducing Ordinal Theory, Taproot Wizards, an Ordinal project, was launched in February 2023, featuring a collection of 2121 collectible digital wizards cards. Subsequently, Ordinals garnered considerable attention from established projects, leading notable entities like OnChainMonkey, DeGods, and Yuga Labs, the creators of the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT collection, to join the Bitcoin network. These inscriptions can be viewed and traded on various NFT marketplaces. The concept then spread to Ethereum and other Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible chains such as BNB Chain, Polygon, and Avalanche, where users, enticed by low transaction costs, started embedding data within transactions. Notably, Ethereum is the most popular blockchain for non-fungible tokens, featuring some of the top NFT card collections, such as CryptoPunks and BAYC. Data from Dune Analytics shows a notable surge in inscription volume on the Bitcoin blockchain. As inscriptions gained traction over time, the community expressed concerns about issues such as high transaction fees and the long-term effects on the scalability of the Bitcoin network. A Bitcoin developer, Luke Dashjr, called inscriptions a “bug” that needs to be fixed, saying that they were bringing vulnerabilities to the blockchain by embedding data on top of it. While critics have been vocal about the issues with inscriptions, in late 2023, Rodarmor criticized Bitcoin maximalists over their complaints and attempts to “censor” inscriptions. “Simultaneously believing that Bitcoin is unstoppable internet money and thinking that a bunch of [redacted] publishing JPEGs on-chain is any kind of problem is a contradiction.” After inscriptions hit the market, building upon the Ordinals protocol, developer Domo introduced the BRC-20 token standard, enabling the issuance of fungible tokens on the Bitcoin network. ORDI became the first BRC-20 token launched on Bitcoin. Following its launch, the idea gained market adoption, leading to BRC-20 marketplaces allowing the buying and selling of tokens. Crypto inscriptions allow users to embed data into satoshis. They are created by packaging arbitrary data, like an image or document, stored in Bitcoin’s “witness data.” This inscription data is limited to 520 bytes, while creating larger inscriptions requires linking them. The inscribed satoshi is transmitted to the network through two sequential transactions: a commit transaction and a reveal transaction. The commit transaction creates a Taproot output committing to the script with an inscription. Subsequently, the reveal transaction discloses the entire script, enabling the creation of the inscribed satoshi output. Upon transmission, these transactions enter the mempool, awaiting confirmation by miners. Once mined, the inscription becomes a permanent fixture on the Bitcoin blockchain. Users then employ tools such as the Ordinals Explorer to facilitate tracing and viewing of inscriptions. Unlike normal Bitcoin transactions or Ethereum NFTs, creating, minting, and tracking inscriptions necessitates running the proprietary “ord” client on top of a fully synchronized full node. The “ord” client, in conjunction with Bitcoin Core, enables users to inscribe individual satoshis and track them across the UTXO set. Without this client, a regular Bitcoin wallet cannot distinguish between inscribed and regular satoshis. Did you know? Casey Rodarmor created the first Ordinal inscription on the Bitcoin blockchain, inscription #0, on Dec. 14, 2022. The inscription was a pixel art representation of a black-and-white skull. Below are some of the benefits and drawbacks of crypto inscriptions as observed on the Bitcoin network, its pioneer use case. Crypto inscriptions are a significant advancement in digital assets. They allow the embedding and transfer of digital artifacts directly within the blockchain, creating new asset creation and transaction opportunities. While there are challenges, such as concerns about fungibility and blockchain scalability, crypto inscriptions have brought about more security, efficiency, functionality, and adoption. Inscriptions on Bitcoin are metadata added or “inscribed” onto Bitcoin satoshis (sats), which can be text, videos, images, or audio files. Each sat is assigned a unique identifier based on its transaction history, which allows for the tracing and identifying individual satoshis with inscriptions attached. The inscription market is a platform where users buy, sell, and trade inscribed assets on blockchain networks. Some exchanges that offer both NFT trading and inscription trading marketplaces are Binance, OKX, and Bybit. EVM inscriptions involve embedding data within transactions on Ethereum virtual machine (EVM)-compatible blockchain networks such as Polygon and BNB Chain. They leverage Ethereum’s smart contract functionality for purposes like token metadata storage or NFT creation. Inscriptions are just another way to create an NFT. Bitcoin NFTs, or inscriptions, are unique because, unlike other blockchains, they are stored directly on the blockchain. In Web3, inscription refers to embedding data directly into blockchain transactions to create unique digital artifacts. It enables you to turn digital assets such as audio, images, and video into unique items on the blockchain. Inscription is the general concept of embedding data onto the blockchain. In contrast, Ordinal is the unique identifier assigned to each satoshi (the smallest unit of Bitcoin) when an inscription is attached. EVM stands for Ethereum Virtual Machine. It is a component of the Ethereum blockchain that executes smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. EVM allows developers to write smart contracts in programming languages such as Solidity to develop decentralized applications (dApps) on Ethereum.

Twelve Democratic Senators voted in favor to pass the resolution Thursday: Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, John Hickenlooper of Colorado, Gary Peters of Michigan, Jon Tester of Montana, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, Mark Kelly of Arizona, Jacky Rosen of Nevada, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. SAB 121, introduced in March 2022 and enacted the following month, states that digital asset custodians should report a liability and “corresponding assets” on their balance sheets for all custodied cryptocurrencies. The practice, SEC staff said, is intended to guard against the “significant risks and uncertainties associated with safeguarding crypto assets.” Last week, in the Republican-controlled House, 21 Democrats voted in favor of passing the resolution. The White House said last week that should the legislation make it to President Joe Biden’s desk, he would veto it.

Rep. Wiley Nickel, D-N.C., who co-sponsored the resolution, on Wednesday asked SEC Chairman Gary Gensler to repeal SAB 121 ahead of the Senate vote. Read more from our opinion section: It’s time to overturn SAB 121 “Today’s Senate vote to repeal SAB 121 sends a clear bipartisan message: Congress will not stand idly by as Gary Gensler and the SEC deliberately sidestep the statutory rulemaking process and overstep their regulatory authority,” Nickel said Thursday in a statement.

349::https://coinatory.com/cryptocurrency-articles/are-crypto-airdrops-to-make-money-11993/::Coinatory::article::Are Crypto Airdrops a Good Opportunity to Make Money in 2024?::Think of a crypto airdrops as a free giveaway, where new digital coins or tokens are handed out to people who already own some cryptocurrency::Think of a crypto airdrops as a free giveaway, where new digital coins or tokens are handed out to people who already own some cryptocurrency or those who do a few tasks. Blockchain startups use this tactic a lot, kind of like a promo, to get the word out about their new projects. Moreover, digital assets can have multiple use cases. Over different time spans, they can grant users decision-making powers within a network or give them VIP access to content via NFTs. What’s cool about these assets? They can be swapped or sold super easily. That’s because they’re highly liquid. So, if you get assets through an airdrop, you could trade them for other cryptocurrencies or even cash them out into your local currency. There’s a variety of airdrops out there, but a common thread is that you typically need to register in some way to get those free digital goodies sent to the right wallet address. For some airdrops, you might need to do a task or two. Regardless of the requirements, the end game is pretty much the same: make sure your wallet address gets noted down before the deadline. When a startup sets its sights on an airdrop, the kickoff is usually a public campaign. To get the word out, they often take to places like forums and social media like Discord and Twitter. Create a buzz around a new platform launch or a fresh feature, and of course, the juicy airdrop reward. As the hype builds, the next move for these companies is to make a list of who’s getting the tokens. This isn’t one-size-fits-all; they might gather wallet addresses from those who show interest, or they might take a ‘snapshot’ at a specific moment. This snapshot helps them see who’s eligible based on certain criteria. For instance, if they want to reward those who were using their platform before September, they’ll take a snapshot of all the active wallet addresses from that period. Related: Discover how to create NFT in just 6 easiest steps! Absolutely, from a user’s point of view, airdrops can be like hitting the jackpot without buying a ticket. First off, it’s kind of like getting dividends on stocks. If the crypto airdrop project takes off, those airdropped tokens that appeared magically in your wallet might appreciate in value. So, by just sitting tight and holding onto them, you could see a tidy sum down the road. Then there’s the extra layer of perks some airdropped tokens bring to the table. Imagine being handed a membership card to an exclusive club. On some platforms, these tokens don’t just sit idly; they give you voting rights, especially if they double as governance tokens. So you get to have a say in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) decisions related to the platform. And it doesn’t stop there. Think of these airdrop tokens as seed money that you can invest to grow more digital crops. Advanced crypto farming techniques like yield farming or lending can help users expand their portfolios, turning those “free” tokens into interest-earning assets. All in all, airdrops are more than just freebies; they’re opportunities. And who doesn’t love a good opportunity, right? When you think about crypto airdrops, there’s a bunch to mull over. First off, you’ve got to be cautious about the safety of your network. When you’re trying to get these airdrops, some dodgy ones might ask you to link your wallet to some sketchy websites. Once you’ve done that, you’re potentially giving a thief an all-access pass to your account info. Then there’s the fact that not all airdrops crypto are the real deal. I mean, who doesn’t like free money, right? But some of these projects are just baiting folks to buy more tokens to up the value of their airdrop crypto. What’s the catch? Well, they could just flood the market with a ton of these tokens all at once, causing the price to plummet and making the airdrops you got earlier pretty much worthless. Some folks might also see airdrops as kinda low-tier. Instead of giving out free tokens willy-nilly, maybe it’d be better to reward the people actually doing the hard work, like the miners or others putting in the effort on a project. Oh, and here’s a kicker: even if you do get an airdrop, you might not be able to do much with it. Sometimes these airdrops say they’re worth a boatload of money, but if you can’t trade ’em because there’s no demand, then they’re pretty much just fancy, worthless digital trinkets.

Breaking Records for New ETFs::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Yesterday marked the deadline for investment firms managing over $100 million in Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) shares to disclose their holdings, and the data shows that these newly launched ETF products are attracting significant interest from institutional players. According to combined data from Fintel, over 1500 entries disclosed total ownership of around $10.6 billion in these ETFs. Of the ten spot Bitcoin ETFs, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), and ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) are the top choices for professional investors. Hedge fund giant Millennium Management leads the pack with $1.97 billion worth of Bitcoin ETF shares, according to a recent 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Millennium is king of the bitcoin ETF holders w/ about $2b across four ETFs. This is out of over 500 holders (about 200x the avg for new ETF). Majority are inv advisors (60%) but a big dose of HFs (25%). Never can be totally sure what HFs up to but they were def big buyers. pic.twitter.com/iVtVXjhId0 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) May 15, 2024 The fund’s investment portfolio includes $844 million shares in iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), over $800 million in the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), about $202 million in Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), and close to $45 million each in ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) and Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust (BITB). However, the filing reveals that these holdings only account for 3% of Millennium’s $64 billion assets under management. Other top Bitcoin ETF holders in Q1 following Millennium were Susquehanna International Group ($1.1 billion), Bracebridge Capital ($404 million), Boothbay Fund Management ($303 million), and Morgan Stanley ($269.9 million). According to Bitwise’s CIO Matt Hougan, the investment trend in Bitcoin ETFs is gaining momentum. The current level of institutional ownership is unprecedented for a new ETF. Traditionally, most ETFs see minimal participation from large investors in their initial months. For instance, the gold ETF launch in late 2004 was considered wildly successful, amassing over $1 billion in its first five days. However, even at its first 13F filing, only 95 professional firms held positions in the gold ETF. By comparison, Bitcoin ETFs are experiencing a historic surge in terms of the sheer number of institutional investors involved. While professional investors currently hold an estimated 20% of the total Bitcoin ETF assets, retail investors still dominate the landscape. However, Hougan noted that these early institutional allocations could be just the tip of the iceberg as institutional engagement deepens. “…the allocations we see in recent 13F filings are just a down payment. Hightower Advisors may have $68 million allocated to bitcoin ETFs today, for instance, which is great, but it’s just 0.05% of their assets. If they follow the pattern outlined above, that allocation will build over time. And to put it in context, a 1% allocation of their portfolio to bitcoin would equate to $1.2 billion—all from a single firm,” Hougan stated. “Multiply that by the growing number of professional investors participating in the space, and you can begin to see what’s behind my enthusiasm,” he added.

351::https://theconversation.com/bitcoin-isnt-getting-greener-four-environmental-myths-about-cryptocurrency-debunked-155329::The Conversation::article::Bitcoin isn’t getting greener: four environmental myths about cryptocurrency debunked::Bitcoin is attracting attention from big buyers like Tesla. But don’t be fooled – it’s still a disaster for the climate.::The price of bitcoin has reached US$50,000 (£36,095) – another all-time high. It’s hard to believe that 10,000 bitcoin would only buy a couple of pizzas ten years ago. It’s even stranger to think that bitcoins are completely virtual. You can’t hold one, except on a hard drive, and there’s no underlying asset to them. A bitcoin is simply a digital representation of the computer power needed to make one, what’s called its “proof-of-work”. This isn’t actually a new idea though. Rai stones were one of the first forms of money used on the Micronesian islands of Yap. To get hold of a Rai, you had to row a canoe for 500km or so to Palau and chisel away at some local limestone. Then you needed to take the 3m-wide lump of rock back to Yap without sinking in the Pacific. No one is quite sure when it started, but the practice is at least several centuries old. Yapese money had no inherent value. For everyone to respect the proof-of-work, the process was deliberately inefficient and incredibly resource-intensive, just like bitcoin. Instead of relying on intrepid voyagers, bitcoin uses a global network of competing computers. Like safe crackers at a safe-cracking contest, these bitcoin mining machines guess the combination to a digital lock (a long string of digits) with the correct combination winning a few new bitcoins. The combination changes every ten minutes, and the contest continues. This might all sound like a harmless game of digital bingo. But with more and more people enticed by the heady rewards, bitcoin mining on some days uses as much energy as Poland and generates 37 million tonnes of CO2 each year. New institutional investors, like the carmaker, Tesla, are driving the asset’s price skywards while ignoring bitcoin’s climate-changing appetite. And to keep the bull market charging, supporters are working hard to argue for bitcoin’s green credentials. For the sake of a stable climate, these myths need debunking. Myth one: bitcoin mining is becoming more efficient Bitcoin’s carbon emissions are not the network’s only dirty secret. In 2011, competing miners could win the bitcoin bingo with an average laptop. Today, viable operations require investing in warehouses filled with specialised hardware known as Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC). As the majority of mining costs come from energy to run these units, bitcoin miners are always careful to use the cheapest. To avoid wasting energy, the global arms race for bitcoin requires ASICs to be replaced for newer and more efficient models every year. ASICs can’t be easily repurposed for general computing. Redundant units create around 11,500 tonnes of hazardous electronic waste each year, much of which is dumped on cities in the global south. Myth two: bitcoin encourages investment in clean energy Chinese hydroelectric power plants are popular spots for bitcoin mining. While China cracks down on the industry, 61% of bitcoin mining is powered by fossil fuels. Cheap coal in Australia has found new buyers through bitcoin, as formerly redundant coal mines are reopened to power mining. Miners are willing to move anywhere for residual energy, increasing the profitability of natural gas in Siberia and supporting oil drilling in Texas. In Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo, bitcoin miners are getting special access to cheap, clean energy produced by an EU-funded hydroelectric plant. The plant was designed to help locals find livelihoods beyond poaching and stop them resorting to scouring parkland for wood fuel. Bitcoin miners employ armies of computer servers, not the ex-combatants the plant could help. Myth three: bitcoin replaces the need for gold mining Gold mining is one of the world’s most destructive industries. Bitcoin was originally intended as a digital replacement for gold that was also a deflationary means of exchange, capable of rendering wasteful banks and regulators redundant. But for many institutional investors, gold is being bought to hedge against bitcoin’s volatility. Tesla poured US$1.5 billion into bitcoin, but also declared an interest in gold. While bitcoin is currently experiencing all-time price highs, gold hit one of its own in 2020. Read more: Gold mining leaves deforested Amazon land barren for years, find scientists Nor has bitcoin displaced traditional finance institutions. Major banks are vying to get very rich indeed on the back of it. Myth four: corporate players will boost market for ‘green bitcoin’ Some argue that institutional investors can turn bitcoin green. Yves Bennaim, the founder of Swiss cryptocurrency think tank 2B4CH, claims that as investors like Tesla push prices up, “there will be more incentive to make investments in renewable sources of energy” for bitcoin mining. But miners will always use the cheapest option to maximise returns. It’s not possible to allocate additional rewards to miners using renewables, because it’s difficult to know exactly which bitcoin miners use renewables. Unfortunately, there is currently no such thing as a “green bitcoin”. Not all cryptocurrencies are as energy-intensive as bitcoin, though. There are alternatives to proof-of-work. The second biggest blockchain project, ethereum, is switching to proof-of-stake, a new system which is supposed to remove the need for data miners and perpetual hardware updates. Bitcoins are dirty things, but pointing this out to would-be investors should not mean throwing the blockchain baby out with bitcoin’s bath water.::2021-02-17T16:04:31Z::Audio narrated, Bitcoin, Carbon dioxide (CO2), Cryptocurrency, Data mining, Digital money, Energy, Greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), Tesla::Peter Howson::Environment::https://images.theconversation.com/files/384726/original/file-20210217-21-lgeuqq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=508%2C606%2C2297%2C1146&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
352::https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/03/13/why-prime-brokers-could-be-a-source-of-crypto-contagion/::CoinDesk::article::Why Prime Brokers Could Be a Source of Crypto Contagion::Prime brokers are a new source of liquidity in this cycle, which could be good and bad in the long-run, says Phillip Moran, CEO of the Digital Opportunities Group.::Digital asset markets have been vibrant recently, and this has been a great respite after almost two years of crypto winter. I do not want to throw a wet towel on current sentiment, but it is good to remember that the seeds of the next crash are often sown during the good times. Because risk management is the primary job of all portfolio managers, here I want to opine on one potential scenario if this bull market continues for another 18-plus months. Here is why I think the potential nexus for future contagion could be prime brokers (PBs). Why? Because 1) PBs are emerging as a major player and lender in crypto markets and2) The current lending standards of PBs are tight, largely lending to low drawdown strategies (like delta-neutral), and presents low systemic risk. But, 3), if expected returns of delta-neutral strategies decline, then PBs may move out the risk curve in terms of who they are willing to lend to and what services they offer, which could brew systemic risk. During the last bullish cycle, lenders increased the violence of the implosions that we witnessed. Leverage was hidden across a network of entities (BlockFi, Voyager, etc.), with concentration at certain nodes (3AC, Alameda). The lenders of the old-world are largely gone, but there is a new source of liquidity: prime brokers (PBs). Currently, PBs generate most of their revenues through 1) trading revenues from market access, and 2) lending revenues from lending, typically to delta-neutral strategies. Funding arbitrage is a strategy which benefits from market demand to go long via derivatives. This exploits the funding interest rates paid out from perpetual swaps (a crypto derivative product) by going long on spot and short perpetual swaps (or vice versa). This generates attractive yields and exploits market demand to go levered long, while not exposing the strategy to directional market moves. If the strategy is implemented well, the risk is very low, which makes it a popular strategy for PBs to lend to. While funding rates are currently elevated from recent upside price action, I believe it is reasonable to expect the returns to come down as more money flows into these lower-risk strategies. With returns declining in funding arbitrage, we will likely see returns in other lower risk strategies fall. If expected returns decline below the borrow cost from PB loans, then the PBs will be forced to make the decision to move out the risk spectrum or reconsider their product offerings. What could this apocalyptic future fueled by crypto PB collapse look like? What could it be fueled by? Here are a couple ideas: Further aggregation of liquidity through PBs: Increasing volume requirements for better fee tiers at centralized exchanges, like Binance and OKX, will push most traders to access the market through PBs instead of their own master accounts. Synthetics, swaps, other derivatives: If trading directly on exchange becomes restricted (either due to the exchanges themselves limiting direct access, or the PBs limiting access), this may create a market of derivatives for traders where the PB will clear the other side (usually this is a swap mechanism). This opens the door for accounting issues, or leverage shenanigans. We should enjoy the good times while they are here, while also considering future disaster scenarios.

April has been an extraordinary month, in which the cryptocurrency industry has seen significant changes. The Bitcoin halving has been completed. Concurrently, Dubai became a hub for cryptocurrency experts, including practitioners, key opinion leaders (KOLs), investors, and media representatives. In this vibrant atmosphere, Coinstore successfully hosted two major events: the “2024 Coinstore Premiere Brand Conference ” and the “Finding the Future Alpha ” forum on new public chains. Coinstore’s Premiere Brand Conference has attracted widespread attention, with industry-renowned institutions such as ICP, Infinity Ventures, and BTC Security Labs sponsoring and supporting the conference. Over 500 crypto entrepreneurs, investors, experts, and prominent KOLs gathered to discuss the industry’s hottest topics. At the event, Manfred Chew, Associate Director of Coinstore, announced two major news. The first announcement was the launch of the IEO 2.0 product. Relying on the extensive operational experience of Coinstore’s collaborative teams, Coinstore IEO facilitates internal traffic routing, connects with the community, and leverages promotions to support projects in addressing their weaknesses for positive development. By introducing the IEO 2.0 product for innovative and promising projects, Coinstore aims to facilitate the development of blockchain projects, thus listing tokens which will maximize users’ profits. In addition, Manfred announced the brand ambassador recruitment program to spread the brand’s exposure with famous crypto industry KOLs. Cooperation with KOLs has always been an important strategy in Coinstore’s development. Previously, Coinstore has been working with over 400 KOLs to launch livestreams including Coinstore X Space and CS Live. Coinstore’s livestream has always been dedicated to spreading Coinstore’s brand image- The first choice for the initial launch. In addition, speakers shared their insights on trending topics such as Depin, RWA, and DID, among others. The audience agreed with the speakers’ viewpoints and engaged actively in the discussions. Ultimately, the conference concluded on a high note, marked by a dynamic exchange of ideas. In a lingering atmosphere of anticipation, Coinstore held its second event – a public chain forum themed ‘Finding the Future Alpha’. The forum was jointly hosted by Jsquare, a research and tech-driven investment firm. Additionally, Coinstore also partnered with famous institutions including, CGV Capital, Rocktree Capital，ABCDE Capital，Inception, Nano Labs, Mindfulness Capital, and Waterdrip Capital to discuss the development and opportunities of public chains and contribute to the industry development. Manfred, the Associate Director of Coinstore, announced that Coinstore will enhance its global partnerships and actively engage in project incubation. Additionally, Coinstore plans to launch the IEO 2.0 product and a traffic ambassador program to boost its brand influence and competitiveness. As the conference progressed, VCs expressed their views on investment trends. In the panel discussion,JT Law ,Partner of IVC,Omer Ozden (Chairman) – Rocktree Capital,James Wo,Co founder of DFG discussed how VCs found the next alpha unicorn. James believed the approval of ETFs helped a lot of people without a CEX account to enter the crypto sphere. Additionally, the increasing number of applications is attracting more participants, suggesting that this bull market cycle could last longer than the previous one. Omer predicted that the price of Bitcoin would surpass that of gold, noting that regulatory developments are opening up more possibilities, unlike the last cycle, which was predominantly focused on narrow ICO narratives. Established in 2020, Coinstore has quickly grown over three years, serving more than 700 project teams and reaching over 7 million users. The platform has significantly expanded and evolved, establishing a robust presence in emerging markets, particularly in Indonesia, India, and Nigeria. Prior to the conferences, Coinstore had amassed considerable experience in organizing events and actively hosted Cryptalk and CS Connect events. To date, Coinstore has organized more than 30 Cryptalk sessions, nearly 40 CS Connect gatherings, and 22 Expo conferences. These events have served as vital connectors within and outside the industry, attracting global participation and receiving enthusiastic responses. The successful wrap-up of the Dubai conferences marks the start of a new chapter for Coinstore. Notably, the public chain forum is set to become a benchmark event. Looking ahead, Coinstore plans to host more forums and events that will foster the convergence of technology, capital, and fresh ideas, thereby driving innovation in the cryptocurrency industry.

The largest cryptocurrency is now up more than 10% over the past seven days to hit the highest price since late April. Researchers from Matrixport attribute the run to favorable macroeconomic conditions. US inflation eased slightly in April, according to the latest consumer price index report released Wednesday, which showed prices were up 0.3% last month, slightly below expectations of a 0.4% increase. Read more from our opinion section: Don’t dismiss the misunderstood techno-optimist voter “The trigger for the post-CPI pump this week was a marginally lower-than-expected inflation number that catapulted [b]itcoin +7% higher,” Matrixport analysts wrote in a note Friday. “However, the buying occurred relatively [gradually], indicating a persistent buyer in the market instead of a fast re-pricing, as we usually see when economic data causes a huge surprise.” Ether (ETH) also posted a rally this week, gaining close to 7%, per Coinbase. The cryptocurrency is now trading back above the $3,000 level after hovering around $2,900 last week. US equities on Friday were relatively flat after a week of returns. The S&P 500 is up 1.2% over the past five trading days while the Nasdaq Composite has gained 1.8%. Wednesday’s inflation print was enough to assure markets that the Federal Reserve will refrain from raising interest rates in June. Traders still widely anticipate that central bankers will opt to hold rates steady, according to Fed fund futures data from CME Group. Now that an increase is off the table, markets can breathe a sigh of relief, Matrixport analysts said. Even after three Fed officials — Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, New York Fed President John Williams and Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin — on Thursday in separate speeches insisted that rate cuts are a long way off, traders were undeterred. “Interestingly, the total number of expected cuts has not moved — CME futures are still pricing in two before December,” Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto is Macro Now newsletter, said. “Rather, it’s the timing that is in question, with a slight increase in hopes the first comes in July and 70% odds it comes in or before September.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

This surprising decision, which comes from a source knowledgeable about the matter, suggests a potential change in how regulators view cryptocurrency products. Back in August, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals thoroughly examined and overturned the SEC’s initial refusal of Grayscale’s proposed Bitcoin ETF. This case had drawn keen attention from the financial industry, which has been eagerly pushing for such initiatives for the past decade. The court’s ruling asserted that the SEC had made a mistake in its judgment, pushing the regulatory agency to reconsider Grayscale’s application. A spot Bitcoin ETF offers investors a unique opportunity to gain exposure to Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, without needing to own the cryptocurrency directly. Grayscale argued in court that the SEC had previously approved specific surveillance measures to prevent fraudulent activities in Bitcoin futures-based ETFs and that a similar approach should be suitable for their spot ETF. The main argument here is that both spot and futures funds are tied to the valuation of Bitcoin. According to the appellate court, Grayscale’s application had been arbitrarily denied because the SEC failed to explain why the two setups (for futures and spot ETFs) displayed significant differences. A forthcoming directive from the appeals court will likely clarify how its decision should be implemented, possibly requiring the SEC to reconvene and thoroughly reassess Grayscale’s application. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

356::https://cryptobriefing.com/solana-meme-coin-surge/::Crypto Briefing::article::Solana meme coins surge up to 210% despite Pump.fun incident::Solana meme coins defy odds with market rally after Pump.fun exploit. Pump.fun explains the ‘exploit’::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Meme coin marketplace Pump.fun was attacked by a former team member yesterday, resulting in halted trading, users unable to liquidate their tokens, and the platform losing $1.9 million, according to a May 16 post-mortem. Despite this episode, the meme coin sector on Solana stood firmly in the last 24 hours, with tokens making two-digit leaps. The best performance in the period was registered by DogeBoy (DOGB), with a nearly 210% upside, while Pepe Trump (PTRUMP) also saw significant positive movement of 67.5%. Maga VP (MVP), another Trump-themed token, is also among the biggest winners in the period, presenting almost a 31% price advance. On the cat-coins front, MANEKI has shown 34% growth in the past 24 hours at the time of writing, a movement that made its market cap surpass $91 million. UpSideDownCat (USDC) surged almost 54% in the same period, and the cat Chipi (CHIPI) showed a 72% upside. The Costco Hot Dog (COST), a meme coin that backpacked the meme of hot dogs sold at Costco markets never rising in value, has risen 38% at the time of writing. The meme coin FindMe shown in the image above was, in fact, a honey pot attack. Honey pots are smart contracts programmed to forbid tokens from being sold, while the contract deployer drains all the liquidity. Currently, the only FindMe pool available has $231 in liquidity, which highlights the risks of trading meme coins. Moreover, despite showing a 33% growth in the last 24 hours, the token Lola Cat (LOLA) is still relatively new to the meme coin market. Hence, the asset still doesn’t have a seven-day track record. Solordi (SOLO) represents the dog-themed coins on the meme coins with the most substantial growth in the last 24 hours after leaping 37.7%. As reported by Crypto Briefing, a user used flash loans to manipulate token prices on Pump.fun, borrowing SOL from the money market Drift. However, the exploiter was able to move liquidity from Pump.fun’s pools, which would be possible only by using an authorized wallet. Wintermute’s head of research Igor Igamberdiev identified that the wallet commonly used to move liquidity from Pump.fun to decentralized exchange Raydium was being controlled by the exploiter, suggesting a private key compromise or an inside job. In their post-mortem, the meme coin marketplace revealed that a former employee was responsible for the attack, and misappropriated nearly 12,300 SOL. Pump.fun tackled the issue by deploying their smart contracts again, launching pools with the whole they met in the bonding curve during the incident, and removing the platform fees for the next seven days.

357::https://theconversation.com/price-hikes-in-ether-and-bitcoin-arent-the-signs-of-a-bubble-79350::The Conversation::article::Price hikes in Ether and Bitcoin aren’t the signs of a bubble::While the current speculation in crypto-currency and assets should make us pause, this is not a speculative driven bubble like tulips, or gold mining stocks.::When there is a rapid growth in any of the crypto-currencies and assets such as Bitcoin, Ether, Zcash and others, many will call it out as a bubble. Indeed, on a relatively short time scale it clearly looks like a bubble. The entire crypto-currency market capitalisation currently stands at around US$100 billion; it was US$60 billion one month ago. But Bitcoin was worth 1/100 of a US cent in June of 2009, 7 cents in June 2010, and US$7 in June of 2012. Recently all eyes were on Ether. Over a 90 day period, Ether appreciated twice as quickly as Bitcoin did in late 2013, when Bitcoin crashed to around 35% of it’s highest value. Aside from the 2013 crash, Bitcoin has experienced smaller crashes many times since, but is now worth double its 2013 high. In the longer term, these are fluctuations around a strong growth trend. Crashes will cause some to abandon the field. But signals of longer term growth in these crypto-currencies and assets point to a possible emergence of a new type of market, through the building of a new economic infrastructure. Ether is the token of the Ethereum blockchain, a platform that runs “smart contracts” through a distributed online ledger that records transactions. It’s second only to the crypto-currency Bitcoin in price. Some believe it will one day overtake Bitcoin (a process dubbed “The Flippening”). Fundamental aspects of the technology that underpins crypto-currencies and assets are causing people to re-imagine, and then enact, new ways of creating and exchanging value online. The key difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum is that you can use Bitcoin for payments, but you can use Ether to automate any number of processes using smart contracts. While many use cases for Ethereum are still at the proof-of-concept stage, it is now attracting the attention of major banks, businesses and governments, all interested in the potential of the technology to provide greater efficiency and transparency in transactions. That normalisation has collapsed the implicit risk premium attached to this technology. Venture capitalist Albert Wenger describes the current activity in crypto-currencies and assets as “fat protocol investing”. To explain what this is, take the example of the underlying internet and web protocols (TCPI/IP and HTTP), used to build and run websites. These are not able to store value - therefore they are “thin protocols” in Wenger’s terminology. So instead, people invest in companies that make software (applications) and hardware that rely on these protocols. Companies such as Google and Facebook made a fortune by collecting and storing data generated by users through their online interactions. Meanwhile, users, and the developers who created internet and web protocol, received nothing in return. Blockchain is a “fat protocol” because it can be monetised, including incentives for developers but also for users. For example, the creator of JavaScript and co-founder of Mozilla Brendan Eich, recently released an Ethereum-based web browser through which users can be paid for the attention they give to advertisements. What is making crypto-assets and currencies appear bubbly is the way in which many of these new platforms and applications have raised money through what are called initial coin offerings. An initial coin offering (a word play on ‘initial public offering’) is a mechanism by which developers sell the tokens associated with their platform to the public. Depending on the structure of the offering, buyers can usually then trade the tokens, creating secondary markets. As the founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, has noted, no-one has figured out the right model for these offerings. This could be due to the immaturity of the Ethereum platform and ecosystem (which started development in 2013 and went live only in 2015). What we’re observing here is a new economic infrastructure being built and coming online. In tweets on Tuesday, Buterin distanced himself from initial coin offerings, stating he would no longer agree to be an advisor.  So while the current speculation in crypto-assets should make us pause, this is not speculative like tulips, or gold mining stocks. It is speculative like building a new city, in that infrastructure needs to be developed first before you get to see who moves there. A further point to note is that investment bubbles are actually useful and important mechanisms for building new technologies because of the way they concentrate speculative resources on a new technology to facilitate exploration. There is an enormous effort proceeding to building new crypto businesses and infrastructure on the Ethereum platform. If this platform does indeed begin to carry large parts of the global economy as predicted by Deloitte, a business consultancy, then it’s still massively undervalued. These comments should not be construed as offering personal financial advice.::2017-06-19T20:01:29Z::Bitcoin, Bubbles, Cryptocurrency, Currencies, Currency, Ethereum, Financial bubbles::Ellie Rennie::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/174117/original/file-20170616-500-1ypeu9h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

The rest of the report also showed small declines that were inline with expectations. On a year-over-year basis, CPI was higher by 3.4% versus estimates for 3.4% and 3.5% in March. Core CPI – which excludes food and energy costs – rose 0.3% in April against estimates for 0.3% and 0.4% in March; on a year-over-year basis, core CPI was higher by 3.6% versus forecasts for 3.6% and March's 3.8%. The price of bitcoin (BTC) jumped more than 1% in the minutes following the Wednesday morning report, rising to $63,700. With the spot ETF catalyst sidelined for the past few weeks as inflows have slowed or even reversed, bitcoin's price has been under pressure on the idea that interest rates were going to stay higher for longer. The consistent slide in inflation in 2023 had most, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, coming into 2024 expecting appreciably easier monetary policy throughout the year. Instead, inflation has actual risen a bit thus far this year. Along with an economy that continues to grow, it's put the kibosh on the thought of any imminent central bank rate cuts. Coming into Wednesday's CPI report, the odds of a summer rate cut by the Fed were low and traders had priced in just a 50% chance of move in September, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Coming at the same time as the inflation numbers was retail sales data for April showing a flat reading versus forecasts for a rise of 0.4% and March's 0.6%. Retail sales ex-autos rose 0.2 in April, in line with expectations, but down from 0.9% in March. A check of traditional markets finds a positive reaction to the soft inflation and economic data, with S&P 500 futures rising 0.5% and the 10-year Treasury yield sliding seven basis points to 4.37%. The U.S. dollar index has dropped 0.5% and gold has added 0.7%.  Disclosure Please note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.

BTC Layer2 project BEVM has officially disclosed an investment from Bitmain, the leading manufacturer of cryptocurrency mining servers globally. The precise amount of the investment remains undisclosed. Established in 2013, Bitmain still stands today as a significant figure in the digital asset mining hardware production space. Its Bitcoin mining machines previously commanded over 70% of the global market share. Notably, this marks Bitmain’s sole investment in the Bitcoin Layer2 domain to date. Gavin Guo, Core Builder of BEVM Foundation, remarked, “Next, BEVM will delve into exploring Bitcoin hashrate and the PoW ecosystem’s application on BEVM, that could help facilitate the migration of trillions of dollars in PoW hashrate assets and a substantial quantity of BTC to BEVM. This will empower Bitmain assets and unlock liquidity and more diverse financial application scenarios within the BTC Layer2 network.” BEVM serves as the pioneer EVM-compatible Bitcoin L2 network founded on the Taproot Consensus, utilizing BTC as Gas. Leveraging native Bitcoin technologies such as Schnorr Signature, MAST, and Bitcoin Light Node Network, it achieves fully decentralized BTC cross-chain functionality, thereby enabling the trustless integration of BTC into a broader spectrum of applications and facilitating genuine BTC liquidity circulation. BEVM launched its mainnet on March 28th, boasting over 700,000 user addresses and hosting more than 30 ecosystem projects. BEVM also recently announced it had secured tens of millions of dollars in financing, with investors including RockTree Capital, Waterdrip Capital, Arkstream Capital, ViaBTC Capital, and nearly 20 other institutions, resulting in a post-investment valuation of $200 million for the company.

360::https://blockworks.co/news/empire-newsletter-crypto-in-congress::Blockworks::article::Empire Newsletter: Crypto’s day in Congress::Yesterday saw Congress’ upper chamber side with the House on a measure aimed at overturning the SEC's SAB 121.::Yesterday saw Congress’ upper chamber side with the House on a measure aimed at overturning SAB 121 US President Joe Biden | Paul Froggatt/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks Meet the US Senate’s new Democratic crypto caucus — sort of. Yesterday saw Congress’ upper chamber side with the House on a measure aimed at scuttling crypto accounting guidance created by the Securities and Exchange Commission. As Blockworks’ Casey Wagner reported Wednesday, the vote resulted from a behind-the-scenes lobbying campaign involving Republicans and industry advocates. In the end, a dozen Democrats crossed the aisle for the 60-38 vote. When the House voted last week to undo Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, 21 Democrats joined Republicans. What to make of this group, and the relatively swift speed at which this effort took shape? Some of the group have been public about their crypto positions for some time. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, of course, co-authored legislation with Sen. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming. Others, including Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, have expressed support for the US crypto industry in the past. On the other hand, some yes-voting members have taken positions less popular with the industry; Sens. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Mark Kelly of Arizona and John Hickenlooper of Colorado have all scored “very anti-crypto scores” from Stand With Crypto’s political rankings. Read more: Stand With Crypto PAC launches as industry interest in campaign funding ramps up One has to wonder how much the Biden White House’s veto threat factored into the Democrats’ decision to “vote their conscience” — that is, not align behind a particular yea-or-nay group strategy. Remember, several of the votes in question were cast by senators up for reelection this fall: Gillibrand, Casey and Tester. For these members, at least, the vote provides a way to create some daylight between them and an unpopular incumbent. The glass-half-empty interpretation: Biden’s stated plan to veto the bill made it a somewhat “safer” bill to vote on, given the preordained outcome. Of course, it’s always possible that Biden will reverse course and side with a decidedly bipartisan movement in Congress, but given that it’s an election year, such a move would be a surprising one. I think there’s more going on here than political machinations, however. Despite the memes to the contrary, there’s always been Democrat support for crypto issues, albeit not at the fervor expressed by Republicans. It’s possible, quibbles aside, that the popularity of crypto has broken through and created a moment when Congress actually, against the odds, saw fit to move forward with crypto legislation. Sure, it took the form of an opposition measure, and yeah, it amounts to a won’t survive-a-veto messaging bill when Congress is essentially done working for the year. But they did it by a wider-than-expected margin, and that means something. The upcoming election is about much more than crypto. But this week’s vote may mean that the next session of Congress could see real movement on crypto issues. And who knows — there’s still a few more months to go. Maybe Lummis’ and Gillibrand’s bill will get the attention and debate it has long deserved. — Michael McSweeney There are some things crypto just does better. Want to transfer value almost instantly to the other side of the globe, for a fraction of the cost of boring-ass fintech unicorns like Wise and Revolut? Use Tether on a network like Tron or Polygon: frictionless, fast and easy. How about raising funds for a new venture? Like a goat farm. All good — you can easily source liquidity and donations from around the world on social media and buy tons of goats, no questions asked. It turns out crypto also does wanton pointless pumping much better than the stock market. The normie crowd has come back around to meme stocks, about three years after the original /r/wallstreetbets craze. GameStop has pumped up to about 550% and dumped by nearly half over the past few weeks, all because that Roaring Kitty guy tweeted some silly cryptic on Twitter. Other popular memestocks from the COVID era of free helicopter money (stimulus packages) haven’t yet had the same treatment, for better or worse. Whether AMC, Virgin Galactic and Kodak Eastman get their second moment is anyone’s guess. Still, GameStop’s recent 550% is cute compared to what happens around these parts. So is its peak-2021 pump of more than 5,400% (54x). In the past five years — the same period as memecoin mania #1 and #2 — DOGE, FLOKI, WIF, BONK and SHIB have all, at their most, multiplied in price hundreds of times. SHIB however takes the cake, exploding by 80,000x (8 million percent). Sure, there are some caveats: Many memecoins start trading from near zero, so any real market movement sends prices practically off the chart. Hard to compare that with already-listed stocks within the same timeframe. And stock market circuit breakers do tend to put a damper on things. But don’t let that get in the way of a good time. DOGE, for instance, was launched in 2013 and it still went parabolic in 2021, far more than GameStop, Nikola or Hertz ever did. In fact, if SHIB was included in the chart below, it would turn the entire meme stocks sector into a tiny, little, insignificant bubble. Sounds about right. — David Canellis Former Alameda CEO Sam Trabucco has been notably absent from the aftermath of FTX’s downfall, though his name tends to pop up when discussing the collapse itself. Caroline Ellison, his co-CEO prior to his departure, took the stand at Sam Bankman-Fried’s trial though Trabucco didn’t appear once. He also hasn’t been publicly accused of any wrongdoing. But yesterday, Trabucco broke his silence in a letter to the court ahead of ex-FTX executive Ryan Salame’s sentencing hearing. Trabucco’s letter is over three pages long and is….interesting, to say the least. Not only do we learn a lot about Salame’s home life (he hung 80 photographs of his new partner in his home after dating for a month) but we also get some insight into Trabucco’s time at Alameda. Simply put: Trabucco seemed unhappy with the hours and work at Alameda, calling Salame his “lifeline” through the “hardest period of my life.” Obviously, we can’t know what happened behind closed doors and there are still many questions that remain unanswered about Trabucco’s role and the millions of dollars he walked away with. But he’s made one thing clear: He’s a loyal friend. — Katherine Ross Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. Subscribe to the Empire newsletter.

An individual who previously held a position at BlackRock representing the asset management company globally has indicated that there is a possibility of approving Bitcoin based Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) in the United States. This development is not a victory for Bitcoin; it could signify a crucial turning point in how the market perceives this digital currency. The approval of ETFs would carry implications. It would provide investors, known for their substantial financial resources with a secure and familiar avenue to invest in Bitcoin. Many experts speculate that these prominent players could bring about a $17.7 trillion investment. Such a substantial influx of funds might further elevate the value and importance of Bitcoin within the realm of finance. While the timing and certainty surrounding this ETF approval remain uncertain there is an air of excitement surrounding the concept. It is evident that Bitcoins reputation is undergoing changes. What was once viewed now garners attention as a popular choice among influential figures in mainstream finance. Furthermore this development extends beyond Bitcoin itself; it holds potential for implications, across other cryptocurrencies as well. Making an investment, in Bitcoin could potentially instill confidence. Generate interest in other digital currencies ultimately fostering greater trust and encouraging additional investments, throughout the cryptocurrency market as a whole. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

362::https://cryptobriefing.com/pump-fun-sol-exploit/::Crypto Briefing::article::Pump.fun hit by exploit, nearly 2,000 SOL stolen::Wintermute research head suggests inside job in Pump.fun's SOL exploit.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Solana’s meme coin marketplace Pump.fun got exploited this Thursday after its bonding curve contracts have been compromised. In an X post, the team behind the platform claimed to have upgraded the contracts so the attacker cannot withdrawl more funds, and paused the trades for all the tokens. The X user identified as “staccoverflow” claimed to be the author, stating that he drained nearly $80 million from Pump.fun. However, Wintermute’s head of research Igor Igamberdiev shared that the exploit drained almost 2,000 SOL, which is roughly equivalent to $300,000. 1/6 It seems like @pumpdotfun lost ~2k SOL ($300k+) and a bunch of memecoins through a possible private key leakage So let me share evidence of it👇https://t.co/yuuKYkamfZ — Igor Igamberdiev (@FrankResearcher) May 16, 2024 Igamberdiev explains that the attack started with flash loans, which is a feature that lets investors borrow crypto, execute an interaction with a platform with the funds taken, and pay back to the lender all within the same block. Staccoverflow used this function to exploit Pump.fun’s model of bonding curve, where tokens traded on the platform have liquidity pools created on the decentralized exchange Raydium after they reach a market cap threshold. Therefore, he took SOL from Solana’s money market MarginFi, used the funds to buy the tokens on Pump.fun until they reached the threshold to go live on Raydium, and then dumped the assets in the same block. However, a Pump.fun-tied wallet is responsible for moving liquidity from the meme coin marketplace to Raydium. This wallet is supposedly compromised, as it was being used to send the liquidity to the exploiter, who used the funds to repay his loan and sent the remaining amount to a random Solana address. Moreover, Wintermute’s head of research doesn’t discard the possibility of an inside job.

363::https://theconversation.com/alternative-currencies-are-the-future-why-it-matters-for-development-80036::The Conversation::article::Alternative currencies are the future: why it matters for development::All over the world people who have been harmed by the conventional money systems are devising alternative currencies, challenging the centralised monetary policy approach.::When I began to teach in 2012, I decided to start my course with an analysis of how money affects social order. What my students found particularly fascinating was the then-nascent world of cryptocurrencies, which I described at length as a crucial feature in the future of money. Some colleagues criticised my approach. They accused me of indirectly encouraging students to invest in what they saw as a shady, crime-ridden financial underworld. But I was simply exposing young minds to a fast-evolving, complex phenomenon that in my view would have a major impact on power distribution in the global economy. Behind most cryptocurrencies is a simple technology known as “blockchain”, a system residing in multiple computers that allows for peer-to-peer financial ledger recording of all transactions occurring in a network. This results in a transparent open-access registry of monetary flows which makes the intermediation of banking authorities unnecessary. Thus it challenges the conventional belief that money can only work through central planning. As I explain in my book, Wellbeing Economy: Success in a World Without Growth, money systems are undergoing an unprecedented transition from centralised authority to decentralised networks. Conventional money is managed by states and banks, with users on the receiving end of monetary policy decisions. By contrast, most alternative currencies are peer-to-peer. That means they are managed by users themselves and do not require intermediaries. Some of them have global outreach thanks to digital technology, while others are locally based. Take BitCoin, the most popular peer-to-peer currency in the world, with a market capitalisation above 40 billion US dollars. A person buying the equivalent of $1 in BitCoin in 2009 would now possess roughly $25 million. One BitCoin is currently equivalent in value to two ounces of gold. Other rising stars include Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple. Many of these currencies remain quite volatile in the short term. Their upward and downward swings reach over 10% of the value on a weekly basis. But the long-term trend is impressive. States are warming up to them. In April 2017, Japan accepted BitCoin as a legal payment method for retail markets. After threatening digital currencies last year, the Russian government took a U-turn. President Vladimir Putin met the developers of Ethereum and committed to recognising cryptocurrencies in 2018. Following an initial freeze, the People’s Bank of China readmitted withdrawals in BitCoin in June 2017, catapulting the currency to new heights. In the US, cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly accepted as both a method of payment and store of value. The Australian government will soon make it easier for new innovative digital currency businesses to operate, exempting traders and investors from goods and services tax. It’s clear that cryptocurrencies will in the near future become much more common as methods of payment for a wide range of purchases, from online shopping to the local supermarket. Developing economies, too, are opening up to cryptocurrencies. In Venezuela, BitCoin has become the leading parallel currency. It provides millions of citizens with an opportunity to perform transactions and generate livelihoods, including buying food and other basic necessities in a country where official money is worth almost zero. It also allows them to purchase goods from overseas, overcoming ever-stricter capital controls. In East Africa, local innovators have introduced cryptocurrency systems to support cross-border transactions, as exemplified by initiatives like BitPesa. In South Africa, cryptocurrencies are becoming particularly popular. In Nigeria, local traders and activists believe this new money presents an opportunity to democratise the economy. This is propelled by the fact that people in Nigeria have been failed by conventional money. According to my colleague Verengai Mabika, founder of BitFinance in Zimbabwe, the collapse of his country’s formal financial system has made BitCoin an attractive alternative. This is especially the case for online payments, which are restricted by banks, and for remittances, which constitute the backbone of the economy. A growing number of Zimbabweans are also using cryptocurrencies as a saving mechanism (37% of all Bitfinance customers use it for that purpose), Verengai tells me. This is after the massive loss of personal savings during the hyperinflation period of 2008, which led to the collapse of the country’s banks. The decentralisation of money is indeed at the core of this new trend, with potential repercussions in other fields. For instance, Ethereum is designed as a smart contract platform, that is a trading system completely based on peer-to-peer property rights. FairCoin was developed as the preferential currency for cooperatives, social economies and fair trade networks around the world. Cryptocurrencies are just the tip of an iceberg. According to recent estimates, there are over 6,000 complementary currencies in the world, over 50 times the number of conventional money systems. Most of these are user-controllled and are interest-free. One cannot make money by simply trading in them. Hoarding makes no sense in this new world. This is because value is not in the accumulation but in the exchange. The scope is often limited to certain territories or types of transactions (for example, personal care, sustainable mobility and local trade). This creates an incentive to support local economic development and forms of exchange that are valued by communities of users. Regiogeld, a network of local currencies which I studied when I was a researcher in Germany, has proliferated throughout the country. It has become the world’s largest system of local currencies, supporting small businesses and empowering communities. In the near future, we will have a variety of money with different qualities and different purposes. This will make economies more resilient against shocks and will support more equitable and sustainable development, by putting users in the driver seat and reinforcing local economic development. As my research demonstrates, a combination of regional, national and local currencies could also be the best way forward for the European Union, engulfed by its monolithic and unsustainable euro, and for any other process of regional integration, from Africa to other continents.::2017-07-02T08:37:19Z::Africa, Alternative, Bitcoin, Central banks, Cryptocurrency, Currency, Digital technology, Economics, Ethereum, European Union (EU), Litecoin, Monetary policy, Nigeria, People's Bank of China, Regional integration, Ripple, South Africa, Vladimir Putin, Zimbabwe::Lorenzo Fioramonti::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/176029/original/file-20170628-7339-8l56a4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=25%2C431%2C5621%2C2730&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

The $30 million round, which follows a $1.5 million investment from a combination of angel investors and key opinion leaders in early March, included Animoca Brands, Blockchain.com and Hashed among others, the team said in a post on Medium. The protocol uses palm scans and a consensus mechanism it calls Proof of Humanity to uniquely verify a user's identity within a decentralized system. Worldcoin, co-founded by Sam Altman, has similar aims and went live last July using a specialized iris-scanning tool. That piqued the interest of several privacy regulators, including those of France, the U.K. and Kenya. "Proof-of-Personhood is a powerful concept but the solutions that exist today haven't seen adoption because onboarding is invasive and high friction." founder Terence Kwok said in the post. "We're creating a decentralized identity protocol that solves verifiable uniqueness and humanity in a way that protects user privacy and self-ownership of data.” The team at Humanity Protocol plans to use the funds for hiring and product development. A public testnet launch is planned for the second half. Edited by Stephen Alpher.

366::https://blockworks.co/news/vanguard-ceo-blackrock-bitcoin-etf::Blockworks::article::Yes, Vanguard’s new CEO supported BlackRock’s bitcoin ETF launch::Vanguard's new CEO led BlackRock’s ETF business as the company spurred an industry double-take with its bitcoin ETF filing last year. ::The fund giant will ultimately offer a bitcoin ETF, Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals founder says Poetra.RH/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks Vanguard has said it doesn’t believe in crypto’s investment case, and it doesn’t allow bitcoin ETFs to trade on its platform. But the fund giant’s new CEO, Salim Ramji, led BlackRock’s ETF business as the company spurred an industry double-take with its bitcoin ETF filing last year. So something’s got to give, right? Maybe not soon, but ultimately yes, according to Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals (DACFP). Ramji was BlackRock’s global head of iShares and index investing before leaving the world’s largest asset manager in January. He started his career leading the firm’s corporate strategy and moved on to become its head of US wealth advisory. Vanguard said Tuesday that Ramji would succeed Tim Buckley as chief executive on July 8. The firm had revealed in February that Buckley was set to retire by the year’s end. Though Ramji left BlackRock the month that US spot bitcoin ETFs gained Securities and Exchange Commission clearance, he was of course involved in the lead-up. Fast-forward four months, and BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has so far led the category with $15.5 billion of net inflows. IBIT trails the segment’s largest fund — the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) — by less than $1 billion in assets under management. Read more: Strong start, slowing demand: The first 4 months of US spot bitcoin ETFs In a July 2023 interview on Bloomberg TV, Ramji said the company was “incredibly excited” about blockchain technology given its ability to remove considerable “friction” across the financial ecosystem. The then-BlackRock executive likened the planned bitcoin product to its physical gold ETF — the iShares Gold Trust (IAU) — launched in 2005. “The gold is held in custody in a vault, which is remote from us, but it’s now easier to transact in gold using our gold ETFs,” he said at the time. “We’re applying that same philosophy to other new and emerging asset classes like bitcoin, just as we did to gold 20 years ago and just as we did to bonds 20 years ago.” The bitcoin ETF bid was an effort to “help investors gain access to parts of the market that otherwise have been more difficult or really expensive or opaque for them to access otherwise,” Ramji added. For what it’s worth, Vanguard’s Tuesday news release does not mention IBIT or crypto. A company spokesperson did not immediately return a request for further comment. While brokerage firms Fidelity and Charles Schwab, for example, give investors access to trade bitcoin ETFs, Vanguard does not. The company has called the investment case for cryptocurrencies “weak” — noting that most crypto assets “lack intrinsic economic value” and are highly volatile. Read more: As spot bitcoin ETF volumes soar, Vanguard is blocking such trades DACFP’s Edelman, who also founded Edelman Financial Services, said he believes Ramji will bring a more “market-focused approach” to Vanguard. After all, he noted, the company’s focus on being the cheapest doesn’t give it as much of an edge in an increasingly low-cost industry. “Paternalistic views that prevent investors from owning what they want won’t foster growth either,” Edelman told Blockworks. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart said in an X post that he doesn’t think the hire means Vanguard launches a bitcoin ETF in the near-term. “But I think Salim could reverse Vanguard’s stance on not allowing their clients to buy spot bitcoin ETFs on their brokerage platform,” Seyffart added. Bitcoin won’t be the first item on Salim’s agenda, Edelman noted. “But eventually…Vanguard will indeed offer bitcoin ETFs,” he said. “From a purely business perspective, it’s foolish not to.

Coinciding with this trend is an increase in whale activity. A recent analysis by Santiment highlighted these developments. Explored whether this upward momentum would sustain after breaching the $28,000 mark. Historically Bitcoin has experienced upward trends followed by minor setbacks. However the recent 6.6% monthly rise in BTCs value has generated enthusiasm among traders. This bullish sentiment was further reinforced by whale transactions exceeding $100 million particularly observed towards the end of September. The combination of these transactions and the limited availability of Bitcoin on exchanges presents an optimistic outlook. Interestingly a majority of these transactions were associated with self custody practices, which aligns with a growing trend embraced by the cryptocurrency community. Santiment deduced from this data that October would witness a 6 week high for Bitcoin. The report suggests that three prominent categories of BTC whales and sharks—wallets holding 10 100 BTC, 100 1,000 BTC and 1,000 10,000 BTC—have played a role in driving this positive swing, for Bitcoin since early September. The proactive behavior of these whales and sharks combined with the decreasing amount of Bitcoin on exchanges (which is currently at its lowest level since December 2017) has further boosted confidence in the positive trajectory of Bitcoin. Furthermore Santiment has highlighted the prevalence of trades on Bitcoin since mid August. However it appears that these short trades have ceased after Bitcoin initially surged to $28,000 on October 1st. Nevertheless caution is essential. There is still a possibility for short trades to resume, especially if Bitcoins price drops below $27,000. This could potentially introduce volatility into the market. It’s important to keep an eye on trading volume trends and consistent on chain transaction volume as they have often been indicators of local peaks in the past and may indicate a continuation of the bearish market trend. The term “Uptober” is gaining popularity across focused social networks as it reflects optimism regarding Octobers potential impact on prices. However Santiment reminds everyone to maintain expectations. While there is an air of optimism surrounding Bitcoin it’s important to remain cautious. With six months until the next Bitcoin halving and pending Federal Reserve interest rate decisions that could influence the crypto market it is advised to stay vigilant. As, per the report BTC currently stands at $27,363 with a daily increase of 0.46%. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

Since 2015, banks, regulators, tech giants and startups all over the world have raised billions of dollars to explore the blockchain. But the only really successful, scaleable use of the blockchain remains cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Bitcoins currently trade at almost AU$4,000, with a total market cap of A$61.4 billion. Think of the blockchain as a type of transparent spreadsheet or “public ledger”. When someone transfers a Bitcoin, for example, the transaction is verified by “miners”, encrypted and a “block” is added to the spreadsheet. Mining takes a lot of computing power, and so miners are incentivised to participate in the system with a reward of bitcoin. It’s finding a way to put all these pieces together for purposes other than cryptocurrencies that has yet to be figured out. Because of all the computing power required to verify and encrypt new blocks, running a blockchain network is expensive and consumes a lot of electricity. For this reason, a blockchain should only be used if it solves particular problems. For example, a blockchain could allow users to see each other’s ledgers and transactions, negating the need for a trusted third party to manage risk. The blockchain itself, through sophisticated cryptography, would provide privacy and trust. Conversely, if there is already a central third party managing trust between users and verifying transactions (something banks already do for consumers), then a blockchain is probably not needed at all. Failing that, a sophisticated database or expert system would be a cheaper and simpler alternative. The Data61 reports describe some of the possible opportunities for the blockchain in Australia, including monitoring the outbreak of pests or animal and plant diseases, border surveillance, tracking intellectual property, and identity systems that provide greater certainty over entitlements, benefits, and tax obligations. The reports also identify some of the risks. The risks include both business and technical risks. For example, public ledgers do not afford privacy and blockchains generally are not suitable for storing large volumes of high speed data. Bitcoin’s blockchain has been suffering from this very problem for more than a year. Finding a solution is a priority for any developers wanting to attract the number of users needed to make running a network profitable. The use of blockchain in financial transactions also poses problems for compliance with anti-money laundering legislation, which requires that anyone providing financial services (for example) must satisfy themselves as to the identity of their client or customer. These shortcomings may explain why a number of high-profile blockchain projects have recently stalled. For example, last week, the Bank of Canada announced that its blockchain project, Jasper, is not yet fit to handle settlements. Citing transparency and privacy issues, the bank found that the benefits of using blockchain did not outweigh the risks. But risk is not the only reason that blockchain projects are stalling. In February 2017, the R3CEV consortium of banks and technologists announced after more than 18 months of investment, innovation, and testing, that they would not be using blockchain for their project because they did not need it. Meanwhile, in a speech delivered to the Africa Blockchain Conference in March 2017, Andreas Antonopoulos warned that many recent “blockchain” projects are fraudulent attempts to raise capital under the guise of innovation and disruptive technologies. While bitcoin has proven what the blockchain can do, the technology still needs a killer app to justify the hype. The most likely contender is currently a “smart contract”. Smart contracts are programmable transactions with complex internal logic that can interact with internet-enabled devices and other smart contracts. At this time, the problem with smart contracts is that they are susceptible to manipulation. What is needed to test the capacity of the blockchain is a small-scale low-stakes low-risk smart contract that (for example) regulates energy consumption, manages permissions, or ensures payment on supply. Data61’s Smart Contracts Report lists some contenders, but first we need to manage the risk of fraud, breach of privacy, and blockchain bloat. Once these risks have been reduced to nil or negligible, the real work can resume.::2017-06-08T07:10:01Z::Banking, Bitcoin, Blockchain, Blockchain unleashed, Cryptocurrency, smart contracts::Philippa Ryan::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/172881/original/file-20170608-25764-155jjba.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

In July, Nasdaq announced it would stop trying to become a licensed custodian of crypto or digital assets, blaming regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. It quietly shifted to the suddenly hot area of tokenizing T-bills, or creating blockchain-based versions of U.S. debt, according to a person familiar with the matter. But some Nasdaq crypto team members are no longer at the company, according to people familiar with the matter. It's not clear how many left or the degree to which layoffs were involved. In some cases, they've joined companies that are expanding faster into crypto, whereas Nasdaq is purposefully taking its time deciding how to support the industry, one person said. Nasdaq declined to comment on its tokenization plans or staff departures. There has been a breathless rush to create blockchain-based versions of traditional financial assets. For instance, asset management giant BlackRock has thrown its weight behind the trend with its BUIDL platform. Edited by Nick Baker.

370::https://beincrypto.com/road-to-10-million-users-coinstore/::BeInCrypto::article::Road to 10 Million Users: Coinstore’s Approach with James Toh::Coinstore, a dynamic player in the cryptocurrency industry, has experienced remarkable growth since its establishment in 2020.::We use cookies to improve your experience. Coinstore, a dynamic player in the cryptocurrency industry, has experienced remarkable growth since its establishment in 2020. Within three years, it has expanded to serve more than 7 million users and 700 project teams, with a strong focus on emerging markets such as Indonesia, India, and Nigeria. To explore the current state of the crypto market and Coinstore’s strategies, BeInCrypto sat down with James Toh, Global Head of Business Development & Partnership at Coinstore Exchange. «Over the past three years, Coinstore has built an impressive product lineup», James Toh began, highlighting the company’s diverse offerings. «At the moment we have spot trading, over-the-counter (OTC) services, launchpad, wallets, earn program, derivatives, and labs». Coinstore’s growth in emerging markets has been a significant achievement. As of November 2023, the platform has reached over 5 million registered users across 175 countries and regions, with Indonesia, India, and Nigeria being the key markets. Toh notes he anticipates surpassing 10 million users by 2025 as Coinstore continues to expand its operations. «Coinstore has made remarkable progress during the bear market and has become one of the fastest-growing trading platforms in 2023. We adhere to the philosophy of “long-termism” and strive to provide users with a secure and reliable trading platform while contributing to the industry in a down-to-earth manner. In terms of user base, we aim to make cryptocurrency accessible to more people. Our goal is to establish Coinstore as a world-class digital asset exchange». But Coinstore is way more than just a commercial company. The team behind it hopes to have a profound impact on the industry and society, and firmly believes that blockchain technology will create a fairer world. «We’re very committed to providing better tools for society so peope can master the power of Web3», – James notes. The actions speak for themselves: as for today, Coinstore held numerous events to build the bridges between inside and outside the industry, attractions active participation around the world and receiving a warm welcome. «Our Cryptalk events have emerged as a beacon of knowledge and collaboration within the community. These conferences convene industry leaders, enthusiasts, investors, and KOLs from around the world to explore the latest trends, regulations, and developments in the crypto space. With a global perspective, Cryptalk provides a stage for thought leaders to share insights, discuss regulatory advancements, and dive into the latest innovations driving the blockchain sector. To date, Coinstore has held more than 100 conferences in total, covering countries such as Colombia, Thailand, Russia, Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, and many more». April 2024 marked a pivotal moment for the platform. Coinstore hosted two major events, the 2024 Coinstore Premiere Brand Conference and the Finding the Future Alpha forum on new public chains during the Blockchain Week in Dubai. The team hosted over 500 crypto entrepreneurs, investors, experts, and famous KOLs, bringing unique industry perspectives and discussing the latest industry trends, including BTC ecosystem, the development of L2, and the opportunities and challenges of public chains through the industry’s celebrity forum. Discussing Coinstore’s star product, Launchpad, Toh shared its impressive achievements. According to him, launchpad has seen an average IEO subscription rate of 3622,87%, with SOIT delivering a remarkable 27,75x ATH (All-Time High) investment return. CNT and INVT also saw returns of 26,05x and 22,52x ATH, respectively. An IEO or initial exchange offering refers to an event where the sale of tokens is conducted through an established mode of exchanging crypto. It is a way start-up organisations raise capital by selling utility tokens that confer preferred status with the organisation via a crypto exchange platform. The Coinstore Prime board has attracted nearly 20 000 participants with an average gain of over 1,170%. Meanwhile, IEO’s Star Up board has hosted 25 projects, engaging around 50 000 participants. Toh also teased the upcoming IEO 2.0 product, promising to pick up more high-quality projects. «It’s true that most trading platforms offer IEO products, and it’s a significant aspect of many exchanges’ operations. Coinstore has been curating high-quality assets for its users since the launch of its IEO products, and it has become a favorite among our users». When it comes to differentiating Coinstore’s IEO from competitors’, James believes there are advantages in two key areas: screening and service. The screening process involves multiple layers of evaluation and expert assessments, ensuring high-quality assets for users. Coinstore also offers the projects one-on-one assistance for listing, marketing, and operations, providing a personalized service that sets it apart as a trading platform. Toh reiterated Coinstore’s focus on security and compliance, which underpin its one-stop platform strategy. The exchange invest heavily in state-of-the-art security infrastructure, undergoes regular third-party audits and works closely with regulatory agencies to build relevant frameworks. «Coinstore contacts, discusses and cooperates with local regulatory agencies in major target markets to help them understand blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, and at the same time actively cooperates with local regulatory agencies to build relevant regulatory frameworks. We are committed to becoming the most trustworthy and secure trading platform in the world». James also emphasized the need for users to protect themselves. Navigating the world of encryption and cryptocurrency can be like walking through a dark forest, so it’s crucial to cultivate both internal and external skills. This means analyzing investments rationally and objectively, distinguishing good projects from bad ones, and avoiding impulsive, blind, and greedy decisions. Protecting yourself is equally important, he says. Choose a reliable trading platform, participate in trustworthy projects, and conduct transactions in a safe environment. Lastly, diversify your assets to manage them effectively, rather than putting all your eggs in one basket. This will lead to better management and, hopefully, good returns.

It took that long for the fund to see its first day of net inflows. That unprecedented event occurred on Friday, when GBTC saw $63 million in net money enter the ETF, according to Farside Investors data. Read more: Why tracking bitcoin ETF flows matters. And why it doesn’t. GBTC had suffered net outflows for 78 days before that — piling up to equal $17.4 billion. Just don’t expect the GBTC inflows to become a regular thing, one segment observer says. “It’s difficult to discern what might be behind the flows into GBTC,” said Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store. “ETF buyers are an extremely diverse group with varying motivations. That said, I would be surprised if the inflows become a trend.” Part of the reason it will have a hard time consistently attracting new money? Its cost, Geraci noted. Industry watchers have attributed GBTC’s constant asset spillage to the fund’s fee of 1.5% — a much higher level than its 10 competitors in the US. Beyond the fee, bankrupt lender Genesis was among those offloading its GBTC holdings, contributing to the asset exodus from the fund. And still, Grayscale holds the assets under management lead in the category. GBTC manages roughly $18.1 billion in assets, while BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is close behind with about $16.9 billion. Grayscale has defended its higher fee, previously pointing out GBTC’s “market-leading liquidity, tight spreads, high trading volumes and a decade-long track record of operational success.” “While GBTC can still hang its hat on ample liquidity and tight spreads, there are now competing products which can boast the same,” Geraci told Blockworks. The crypto asset manager also filed to set up the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC), which would cost a fraction of GBTC’s price. The company has not yet revealed a final proposed expense ratio. Read more: Grayscale’s planned GBTC sibling is a page from BlackRock’s playbook GBTC would seed the new fund as part of a “spin off” mechanism unique to commodity ETFs, according to Grayscale. In addition, a portion of GBTC’s bitcoin holdings would be allocated to the proposed Mini Trust. Beyond Grayscale’s inflows on Friday, it was a day of net inflows for most of the 11-fund US spot bitcoin ETF category — amounting to $378 million collectively. The asset gains were an anomaly of late, snapping a record seven-day net outflow streak for the segment. Analysts and executives have pointed to expectations of the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates higher for longer as one reason demand for bitcoin ETFs have stalled. The asset’s price also trended downward in April. Bitcoin (BTC) was trading at about $64,000 at about 10:30 am ET Monday — up about 1.4% from a week ago but down nearly 6% in the last 30 days.

The author anticipates that Bitcoin could surge to $120,000 in the coming year and cautions about an impending economic crisis, suggesting that digital currencies could serve as financial refuges. Kiyosaki took to social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, ahead of the TOKEN2049 crypto conference scheduled for September 18-19, to share his bullish views on cryptocurrencies. He believes that traditional forms of money, particularly the U.S. dollar, are nearing obsolescence. He’s also confident in Bitcoin’s ability to recover from market slumps, attributing potential price increases to the upcoming halving event. Despite his claim that green energy initiatives negatively impact the middle class, available data contradicts this assertion. Bank of America has calculated that the Biden Administration’s climate policies under the Inflation Reduction Act have already generated over 86,000 new jobs in clean energy, including 50,000 in the electric vehicle sector, with an additional 1.5 million jobs expected in the next ten years. Labeling fiat money as ‘criminal,’ Kiyosaki advocates for investment in assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin to protect against the devaluation of the currency, which he foresees resulting from the massive influx of capital into the economy and ensuing inflation. He also criticizes the U.S. government and the Federal Reserve for their persistent money printing. Predicting a significant downturn in the U.S. economy, Kiyosaki urges investors to view cryptocurrencies as financial bulwarks during unstable periods. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

373::https://cryptobriefing.com/meme-coin-analysis-strategy/::Crypto Briefing::article::Meme coin traders can benefit from fundamental analysis, says HashKey Capital's Jupiter Zhang::Narrative trading and fundamental analysis don’t lie in opposition, as investors can use both to navigate the market, says Jupiter Zhang. Why bother with fundamentals? More VCs into meme coins::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Meme coins registered 1,300% returns on average during the first quarter, according to a report by CoinGecko. This made meme coins the most profitable narrative in that period and made the number of tokens issued on Solana, the hottest blockchain for meme coin trading, reach an all-time high of 14,648 tokens launched. In this landscape, new investors might be tempted to spray their funds over different meme coins and hope for stellar growth. Jupiter Zhang, head of liquid funds at investment firm HashKey Capital, highlights that “for every success story there are dozens more failures.” “Market fundamentals have never been more important. […] FOMO is not a long-term strategy,” shared Zhang with Crypto Briefing. “Fundamental analysis provides a structured, analytical approach to investment, especially crucial in a volatile market like crypto. While the high returns from meme coins might seem attractive, they are often driven by hype and speculation rather than underlying economic value.” Recently, HashKey Capital published a 217-page book titled “Digital Asset Valuation Framework”, a guide to fundamental analysis in crypto. Zhang is the lead author, and he says that by understanding fundamental analysis, investors can identify assets with real potential and longevity, reducing risk and fostering a more sustainable investment strategy. “This is crucial because, as the meme coin narrative shows, not all that glitters in the crypto world is gold.” Meme coins, as the name suggests, rise by backpacking on a famous meme. Because of this, most of them usually have short lifespans. Investors might not be inclined to learn how to do proper research since spreading money might be more profitable. “Even in the seemingly whimsical area of meme coins, fundamental analysis can provide insights. For instance, evaluating the community engagement, development activity, and use cases of the token can offer a glimpse into its potential sustainability and growth,” explains Zhang. Moreover, fundamental analysis can be useful for identifying what meme coins have a strong enough narrative to sustain longer-term interest from those that are likely to fizzle out with the fading of initial hype. “Fundamental analysis doesn’t necessarily lie in opposition to narrative-driven investing, which focuses primarily on the stories and trends that capture market interest and investor sentiment. They can be used in tandem to provide a more well-rounded evaluation of a digital asset’s potential.” Zhang adds that while fundamental analysis aims for long-term growth against the market’s often emotional and speculative waves, narrative-driven investments are useful to ride the waves of market enthusiasm and investor psychology, potentially reaping quick rewards. However, narrative-driven investing often leads to the fear of missing out (FOMO), and that usually ends in bad investments. In other words, narrative-driven demands an effort to time the market and move swiftly before the narrative shifts, while fundamental analysis delves into the intrinsic value of an investment, looking to identify assets with strong fundamentals that suggest a higher intrinsic value than the market price. “This is a more methodical path to potentially sustainable gains, as it requires rigorous assessment of data. Some things we look at when evaluating the fundamentals of digital assets: a thorough evaluation of a token’s utility, governance structure, supply mechanics, technical stack, and potential innovations there.” The meme coin market was always a way for investors to bet without generating returns for VCs. That is because when a token from a protocol is made available to the public, VCs already have their hands on it for a significantly smaller price. Consequently, if this token gets popular and its price jumps, VCs are the true winners. Meanwhile, since meme coins are issued by the community, this is one sector VCs can’t profit from. Or couldn’t until recently. Shiba Inu closed a $12 million funding round with the participation of Mechanism Capital, Big Brain Holdings, Cypher Capital, and Shima Capital, among others, and this may turn the tide in the meme coin market. “Across sectors, industries, and opportunities, investors will seek returns in all corners of the market. So large-scale investments in meme coins are not really surprising,” says Zhang about the recent movement of VCs into these tokens. “The fundraising success of Shiba Inu suggests that even meme coins can capture serious investor attention when they align with a compelling narrative and show potential for broader ecosystem development based on community engagement.” Therefore, that’s where fundamental analysis shows its weight. Zhang believes that as more people get equipped with fundamental analysis tools, the number of serious investments directed at selected meme coins will show sustained growth over time. “These will likely be the ones that demonstrate real utility, ongoing social value, or strategic significance within the crypto market, beyond just the initial hype.” Share this article The information on or accessed through this website is obtained from independent sources we believe to be accurate and reliable, but Decentral Media, Inc. makes no representation or warranty as to the timeliness, completeness, or accuracy of any information on or accessed through this website.

374::https://theconversation.com/atms-dispense-more-than-money-the-dirt-and-dope-thats-on-your-cash-79624::The Conversation::article::ATMs dispense more than money: The dirt and dope that’s on your cash::What’s on your cash? Studies show our money carries everything from pet DNA and old food to E.coli and traces of cocaine.::We live in a dirty world. Wherever we go, we are among microbes. Bacteria, fungi and viruses live on our phones, bus seats, door handles and park benches. We pass these tiny organisms to each other when we share a handshake or a seat on the plane. Now, researchers are finding we also share our microbes through our money. From tip jars to vending machines to the meter maid – each dollar, passed person to person, samples a bit of the environment it comes from, and passes those bits to the next person, the next place it goes. The list of things found on our dollars includes DNA from our pets, traces of drugs, and bacteria and viruses that cause disease. The findings demonstrate how money can silently record human activities, leaving behind so-called “molecular echoes.” In 2017, a study identified over a hundred different strains of bacteria on dollar bills circulating in New York City. Some of the most common bugs on our bills included Propionibacterium acnes, a bacteria known to cause acne, and Streptococcus oralis, a common bacteria found in our mouths. The research team, led by biologist Jane Carlton at New York University, also discovered traces of DNA from domestic animals and from specific bacteria that are associated only with certain foods. A similar study recovered traces of DNA on ATM keypads, reflecting the foods people ate in different neighborhoods. People in central Harlem ate more domestic chicken than those in Flushing and Chinatown, who ate more species of bony fish and mollusks. The foods people ate transferred from fingers to touchscreens, where scientists could recover a bit of their most recent meals. We don’t leave only food behind. Traces of cocaine can be found on almost 80 percent of dollar bills. Other drugs, including morphine, heroin, methamphetamine and amphetamine, can also be found on bills, though less commonly than cocaine. Identifying foods people eat or the drugs people use based on interactions with money might not seem all that useful, but scientists are also using these types of data to understand patterns of disease. Most of the microbes the researchers in New York identified do not cause disease. But other studies have suggested that disease-causing strains of bacteria or virus could be passed along with our currency. Bacteria that cause food-borne illness – including Salmonella and a pathogenic strain of E.coli – have been shown to survive on pennies, nickels and dimes and can hide out on ATM machines. Other bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) which causes skin infections, are found on bank notes in the U.S. and Canada, but the extent to which they could spread infections is unknown. Try as we may to avoid exposure to germs, they travel with us and on us. Even if disease-causing microbes can survive in places like ATMs, the good news is that most exposures don’t make us sick. Disease transmission linked to money is rare, and no major disease outbreaks have started from our ATMs. Although it doesn’t seem common for diseases to transmit through money, there are ways we could make our money cleaner. Researchers are working on ways to clean money between transactions. Putting older bills through a machine that exposes them to carbon dioxide at a specific temperature and pressure can strip dollar bills of oils and dirt left behind by human fingers, while the heat kills microbes that would otherwise linger. U.S. money is still made from a blend of cotton and linen, which has been shown to have higher bacterial growth than plastic polymers. Several countries are transitioning from money made of natural fibers to plastic, which may be less friendly to bacteria. Canada has had plastic money since 2013, and the U.K. transitioned to a plastic-based bank note last year. Even if our money is not directly responsible for spreading disease, we can still use the dollar’s travel history to track how we spread disease in other ways. The website WheresGeorge.com, created in 1998, lets users track dollar bills by recording their serial numbers. In the almost 20 years since the site’s creation, WheresGeorge has tracked the geographic locations of bills totaling over a billion dollars. Now, physicists at the Max Planck Institute and University of California, Santa Barbara are using data from the WheresGeorge site to track epidemics. Information on human movement and contact rates from WheresGeorge was even used to predict the spread of the 2009 swine flu. Although we don’t know the extent to which money allows diseases to spread, mom’s advice is probably best when handling cash: Wash your hands and don’t stick it in your mouth.::2017-06-21T10:31:20Z::50th anniversary of ATM, ATM, Bacteria, Cash, Cocaine, DNA, Disease, Drugs, E.

"I think it’s important for firms to have consistency in terms of what they stand for and the products and services they offer," Salim Ramji told Barron's. "I have heard [CIO] Greg Davis’ explanation and I think it is entirely consistent with Vanguard’s investment philosophy. It is a logical and consistent point of view." It was not so much Vanguard's decision not to launch its own bitcoin ETF that caused so much chatter, but instead the company's move not to offer its clientele trading access to any of the numerous spot products that became available on Jan. 11 of this year. Ramji didn't address that matter in the interview. At BlackRock, Ramji headed the global iShares business and was a force in that company's decision to offer and win approval for a spot bitcoin ETF. He left BlackRock in January.

The official team has now confirmed, the original date will be moved back to May 31st.::We use cookies to improve your experience. The Mollars token presale was originally slated to end on the 1st week of May; with various reports suggesting different dates. The official team has now confirmed, the original date will be moved back to May 31st. There are two reasons for the pushback. First, by popular demand from top investors and investors in general, the hard cap goal of $2-million should be met or at least 80% there. This will allow the maximal results from the whitepaper plans which include long-term marketing after launch and a full $1MM liquidity pool. Second, a majority vote between creator and developers of the Mollars token also deem the extension appropriate due to the loss of over 45 days, during the ICO marketing period, from the rogue domain registry company attempting to steal the Mollars.com domain. At the peak of the early 2024 term of this token presale, the domain was temporarily ‘held hostage’ by decentralized registry company NJAL.LA. The attempt was stopped within 2 weeks but prior promotions and domain ranking was lost for nearly 45 days causing pre-sales to halt. At the time of the domain heist, traders were buying over 90,000 Mollars tokens per day. The extension deadline of May 31st is final. Afterwards, Mollars token will be launched on a top decentralized crypto exchanges like LBank and BitMart. Currently the Mollars token is being sold at a price for $0.55 (cents) via the official website. It’s in the 5th of 6 pre-sale rounds. In the final round investors will have to pay $0.60 per token. If Mollars ICO hard cap is fulfilled at $2-million-dollars, the new store-of-value asset for Ethereum Blockchain & beyond, it will first list on exchange(s) at a price of $0.62. Also, the liquidity pool for the exchange(s) will be a maximal $1-million-dollars.

Bitcoin was up more than 4% over 24 hours at time of publication, paring losses from earlier in the week that saw the largest cryptocurrency dip as low as $56,500, per Coinbase. Ether similarly bounced Friday, once again hitting the $3,000 level after hovering in the high $2,000 range for most of the week. US stocks broadly opened higher Friday after the latest jobs report showed the economy added 175,000 positions in April, finally coming more in line with the pre-pandemic average of 183,000 job gains per month. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes were up 1% and 2%, respectively, at time of publication. The end-of-week rally was enough to push both indexes into the green over the past five trading days. Crypto-related stocks posted mixed returns midway through Friday’s session. Coinbase lost 3% even after earnings released Thursday showed that revenue beat expectations by close to 20%. MicroStrategy and mining operation Marathon Digital, on the other hand, were in the green, posting around 8% and 3% gains, respectively, Friday. The latest jobs data comes days after the Federal Reserve announced that interest rates would be holding steady for the time being. Central bankers will need to see further evidence that inflation is falling and the labor market is cooling, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said. Even after Friday’s promising report, Fed fund futures markets still showed only a 14% chance of a rate cut in June, according to data from CME Group. The delayed cut cycle could bode well for risk assets like cryptos, though, analysts said. “With rate hikes off the table and markets already pricing in little to no cuts for 2024, we think that this bodes constructively for risk assets as the worst of stagflationary headwinds might be behind us,” analysts from Ryze Labs said in a note Friday.

378::https://coinatory.com/cryptocurrency-news/franklin-templeton-advances-with-ethereum-etf-listing-awaiting-sec-nod-18646/::Coinatory::article::Franklin Templeton Advances with Ethereum ETF Listing Awaiting SEC Nod::Franklin Templeton's Ethereum ETF, Franklin Ethereum TR Ethereum ETF with ticker EZET, is listed on DTCC, signaling readiness for SEC's approval review slated for June.::Franklin Templeton, a prominent asset management firm, has introduced its Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) called the “Franklin Ethereum TR Ethereum ETF,” bearing the ticker code EZET. This significant move involves the ETF’s listing on the website of the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), a pivotal entity for securities transactions in the United States. The appearance of the ETF under the DTCC’s “Create/Redeem” section is a crucial step in its operational deployment, indicating that it is now set up for creation and redemption. It is important to note that this listing does not equate to an endorsement from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as approval from the agency is still pending. The presence on the DTCC platform implies that the ETF has met certain registration and compliance prerequisites, thus qualifying it for trading and settlement within the DTCC’s frameworks. Yet, the ultimate green light depends on the SEC’s evaluation based on comprehensive regulatory criteria. Franklin Templeton submitted a Form S-1 to the SEC in February, aiming to launch a spot Ether (ETH) ETF. If sanctioned, the ETF would trade under the name “Franklin Ethereum ETF” on the Chicago Board Options Exchange. In a recent update this April, however, the SEC disclosed a postponement in its decision regarding the application, extending the review period by an additional 45 days to June 11. Several other major financial institutions, including BlackRock, Grayscale, VanEck, and ARK Invest, are also in the pursuit to secure approval for their respective spot Ether ETFs. Nonetheless, the pathway to approval for these Ethereum-based ETFs seems more complex compared to the earlier sanctioned spot Bitcoin ETFs, which received approval in January. Eric Balchunas, a Bloomberg ETF analyst, estimated in March that the likelihood of a spot Ether ETF receiving approval in May stood at approximately 35%. He highlighted the SEC’s comparatively tentative approach toward Ethereum versus the Bitcoin ETF applications. Balchunas further mentioned that the perspectives of SEC Chair Gary Gensler on Ether, particularly his hesitance to categorically classify it as a security, could potentially impact the decision-making process. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

Share this article The US has emerged as the leading nation in interest for smaller market capitalization crypto, commonly referred to as ‘shitcoins’ or meme coins, with a 16.8% share of global activity, according to a report by data aggregator CoinGecko. Those investors are known by the crypto community as ‘degens.’ The UK and the Philippines are not far behind, capturing 6.2% and 5.1% of the interest, respectively. The report analyzed data gathered by on-chain decentralized exchange (DEX) trackers. The top 25 countries in this category, dubbed ‘crypto degen nations,’ collectively account for 77.8% of the speculation interest on-chain. Southeast Asian countries are also prominent in the list, with Indonesia holding a 4.0% share, Vietnam at 2.9%, Thailand at 1.2%, and Malaysia at 0.9%. Nigeria stands out as the only African nation in the top 25, with a 3.9% share, placing it sixth in terms of interest. Within the European Union, France leads with a 4.4% share, followed by the Netherlands at 3.0% and Poland at 2.4%. Overall, six EU member states are among the top 25 crypto degen countries. It is noteworthy that 18 of the 25 most engaged countries are members of the G20, highlighting the economic significance of these nations in the global crypto landscape.

380::https://theconversation.com/bitcoin-rich-kids-in-puerto-rico-crypto-utopia-or-crypto-colonialism-91527::The Conversation::article::Bitcoin rich kids in Puerto Rico: crypto utopia or crypto-colonialism?::Crypto billionaires enjoy their Caribbean playground but poorer locals with little knowledge of the tech are excluded.::Cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have moved to Puerto Rico to build a crypto utopia – initially dubbed Puertopia but now named Sol – where they plan to pay little in taxes. The crypto expats also hope to demonstrate how the city of the future will look with blockchain methods used for most transactions alongside the development of a new digital cryptocurrency. But it’s less clear about whose future – the few or the many – will be the driving force for change on the US territory. Puerto Rico was devastated by last year’s Hurricane Maria and, with inadequate aid from the US, it desperately needs investment to rebuild the island’s infrastructure. Puerto Rico was already facing severe financial difficulty before the calamity. It goes some way to explaining why local authorities are cautiously welcoming the arrival of cryptocurrency entrepreneurs on the island. But at what cost? The term crypto-colonialism isn’t new. It was coined 18 years ago by Michael Herzfeld, but had nothing to do with cryptocurrencies – the bitcoin network didn’t come into existence until 2009. Crypto-colonialism originally referred to countries, such as Greece and Thailand, seeking to acquire political independence at the expense of massive economic dependence. And it used the original meaning of the word “crypto” – concealed, hidden or secret. Such countries are nominally independent, but their national culture is refashioned to suit foreign models. The term colonialism in this sense is not overt at the point of a gun, but covert through the subversion of norms and cultures. Notably, this definition of crypto-colonialism remains applicable to the socioeconomic consequences of crypto utopia. There is a deep link between libertarianism and the cryptocurrency movement. Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin rely on a decentralised, extralegal and unregulated approach. But while the crypto billionaires will enjoy their Caribbean playground, poorer locals with little knowledge of the technology will be excluded. The mostly male entrepreneurs, who moved to Puerto Rico last year and plan to do more than create a cryptocurrency bank, will perhaps bring crypto libertarian ideas to the island. Their vision is similar to another would-be crypto utopia, the Free Republic of Liberland, which claims to be a “micronation” camped on the western bank of the Danube river. It uses bitcoin as its “national” currency. Back on Sol, the wealthy crypto expats want to use the blockchain system for decentralised elections and even to issue citizenship ID. But we doubt that locals who are fighting poverty will be enthused by these ideas. This behaviour reeks of disaster capitalism – the use of a natural or economic crisis to reshape and mould a society into one which entrenches a libertarian, hypercapitalistic worldview. When you are without power for months and feel ignored, any offer of help can seem a good lifeline with little thought for the consequences. Crypto utopias can also cause severe environmental damage. Puerto Rico remains in a deep power crisis after Hurricane Maria, making the idea of Sol simply impractical. One bitcoin transaction consumes 215 kilowatt-hours (KWh), enough power to supply dozens of households on the island when the grid was at full capacity. The annual electricity consumption for mining bitcoin increased from 9.5 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year to 48 TWh in the last 12 months – 2.5 times higher than Puerto Rico’s total consumption of 19 TWh. Resources and infrastructure, post-Hurricane Maria, are too stretched to support cryptocurrency mining on the island. Crypto rich kids made their fortune on the rapid growth of cryptocurrency markets – which are problematic due to their idiosyncratic risks. It’s a game for wealthy people who can cash out early and lock in gains, having been the developers of the bubbly product. This is characteristic of any bubble – those who get in early do well, those who cash in late do poorly. Our recent research shows that cryptocurrency prices are relatively isolated from the shocks transmitted from other assets, such as gold and equities. But cryptocurrency prices are deeply interlinked with each other, so a fall in the price of bitcoin affects other virtual currencies. If bitcoin can ride out its latest price fall, then it’s likely that crypto-colonialism will slowly spread around the globe. Crypto libertarians – if they follow the Sol model – could focus on those parts of the world that have been ravaged by earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes and economic crises. But cryptocurrency has also become a panacea for economic recovery. In December, Venezuela announced a creation of a new cryptocurrency – dubbed “petro” – backed up by Venezuelan reserves of precious metals, oil and diamonds. It hopes to use this cryptocurrency to fight US sanctions, high inflation and low oil prices. However, bitcoin solutions for developing countries – previously known as neo-colonialism – shouldn’t be seen as the ultimate solution for disaster and crisis management. In the transition period, when the potential of cryptocurrencies and applications of blockchain are unexplored, we have to be sceptical of such initiatives as Sol.::2018-02-14T15:06:49Z::Bitcoin, Blockchain, Capitalism, Cryptocurrency, Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico::Brian Lucey::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/206359/original/file-20180214-174997-1p7pcv0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

Wednesday marked the deadline for institutional investors to file their quarterly 13F report with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, revealing positions held as of March 31, 2024. After Tuesday’s surprising disclosure of a $161 million allocation from the State of WIsconsin, more investment whales turned out to have been part of the unprecedented success of the ETFs. Hedge fund Millennium Management, with more than $64 billion in assets under management, held roughly $2 billion across a number of the spot bitcoin ETFs, according to its filing. The hedge fund, which is led by billionaire Izzy Englander, held its biggest allocation in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), roughly $844 million. It also owned more than $800 million of the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and $202 million of Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), as well as stakes in ARK/21's ARKB and Bitwise's BITW. Another major hedge fund, Paul Singer's Elliott Capital disclosed a stake of nearly $12 million in BlackRock's IBIT as of the end of the quarter. Finally, Apollo Management Holdings disclosed a quarter-end $53.2 million stake in ARK/21's ARKB. Other notable names who revealed allocating assets into the spot bitcoin funds on Wednesday are Aristeia Capital and Hudson Bay Capital. Edited by Stephen Alpher.

BlastUP, the first launchpad platform on Blast, has recently launched its native BLP token. Serving as the fuel for the platform, $BLP may become an essential asset for developers building their apps on Blast which ranks among the largest blockchains by TVL. Currently, $BLP is in its presale phase, which is scheduled to conclude in May 2024. This will be followed by a Token Generation Event (TGE) in the second quarter of 2024. The BLP token was deployed to the Blast mainnet in early March, setting the stage for its upcoming distribution and utilization. The BLP token will provide a robust framework for financial transactions on BlastUP and enhance user engagement through staking. Additionally, the token will support seed staking, allowing its holders to earn interest and gain exclusive loyalty rewards for participating in Initial DEX Offerings (IDOs). Holders of $BLP will also receive allocated portions of token sales from projects launched on the platform. This community-driven approach ensures active holder involvement in the platform’s development. The utilities of the BLP token include: Image source: blastup.io The allocation of BLP tokens is planned to ensure sustainable growth and utility within the BlastUP ecosystem. A significant portion of tokens is reserved for providing incentives to the platform users which promotes active participation and long-term engagement. Another portion is allocated to the team and advisors, subject to vesting periods to align their interests with the long-term success of the platform. The total supply of BLP tokens is fixed at 1 billion, a measure that helps curb inflation and maintain the token’s value over the long term. Presently, a presale event for BLP tokens is active, offering these tokens at a price below the anticipated listing rate of $0.01. As of writing, more than 100 million tokens have already been sold. Image source: BlastUP Docs The BLP token has a number of features that give it a competitive edge: As already mentioned, BLP tokens are in presale currently, which means they are not available on a decentralized exchange yet, but can be bought on the blastup.io only.

383::https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-miners-leverage-ai-post-halving::Blockworks::article::How bitcoin miners are leveraging AI post-halving::As some bitcoin miners turn to AI to diversify their post-halving revenue streams, a competition may be brewing.::As some bitcoin miners turn to AI to diversify their revenue streams, a competition may be brewing Konstantin Yolshin/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks The 2024 halving is behind us, and for some, that means that the reality has set in. Block rewards were cut in half earlier this month, going to 3.125 BTC per block from 6.25. The topic of how bitcoin miners prepared for such a drastic change was extensively covered, with some miners opting to diversify their revenue streams. Hut 8, for example, is already bringing in some revenue from segments like AI. And with AI being such a big buzzword on Wall Street last year, could we see more publicly-traded miners devote resources to the new technology? Read more: As crypto fundraising sees an uptick, where’s the capital set to go? In short, yes. Analysts believe that AI could start becoming a bigger segment for miners. Though, according to Coinshares Research’s James Butterfill, the current revenue that miners such as Hut 8 and Bit Digital bring in are very small, roughly 3%. With AI on the roadmap for other miners — like Core Scientific and Bitdeer — the revenue streams could increase by the end of the year, achieving roughly 5-10% of revenues, Butterfill added. “As a very rough guide, capital expenditures on AI are roughly 40x the amount required for mining, with hugely demanding redundancy systems, consequently it is a big step up from mining,” he said. But the promise of the returns may be enough to lure in miners, and catch the attention of investors on Wall Street. Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer told Blockworks that miners with access to inexpensive power may “make the investments necessary to follow suit since the opportunity is so compelling and would provide downside protection during bitcoin bear markets.” Read more: Hut 8’s business diversity to give it an edge after the halving: Benchmark As more investors — including institutional ones — look to gain exposure to bitcoin through mining stocks, AI could draw them to specific miners. Palmer said the institutional investors who added bitcoin mining stocks to their portfolios are “relatively more balanced in their criteria as they want both exposure to upside and the downside protection afforded by diversification. That is especially the case with buy-and-hold investors with long investment horizons.” And while diversification wasn’t a make-or-break deal for investors in the past, the opportunity afforded by AI for miners with access to cheap power but AI could change that, Palmer added. It’s worth noting, however, that power is a different ballpark, as miners face energy use scrutiny worldwide. Read more: The bid for a climate-conscious spot bitcoin ETF presses on But the bull market may be enough to stave off the need to further diversify revenue streams for now. “We are seeing the miners race to put in place as much energy and hash rate capacity as they can not only to offset the reduced bitcoin block subsidies from the halving, but also to capture the upside of self-mining during a bitcoin bull market,” he told Blockworks. But Butterfill noted there’s a distinction between bitcoin mining and AI: One works at a lower power cost, while the latter is the opposite. Read more: PayPal research proposes greener bitcoin mining “Bitcoin mining is essentially won by the miners with the lowest energy costs, while AI is more profitable at higher energy costs, so we could well see those sites with high PPAs (Power Purchase Agreement) switch over,” he said. AI and bitcoin mining could compete with mining, Butterfill said, causing the sector to shrink. “We may well eventually see a situation where bitcoin mining focuses almost solely on stranded energy, where energy is the cheapest,” he said.

This milestone achievement comes courtesy of Offchain Labs, who have successfully rolled out an enhancement to ArbOS, affectionately dubbed Atlas. This update ushers in support for blob transactions, a strategic move aimed at slashing the expenses associated with data transfers from Layer 2 back to the Ethereum main network. Earning widespread acclaim from the Arbitrum community, the Atlas initiative signifies a major leap forward, with many of the upgrade’s components activated just a day prior. Offchain Labs anticipates this will lead to a staggering drop in the base fee rate, from 0.1 Gwei down to 0.01 Gwei, translating into a reduction in costs for users from around $0.5 to a mere $0.05 for the same operation. In the wake of the Dencun update, other layer-2 solutions like Optimism and Base have also seen remarkable enhancements in gas efficiency. Post-update, the Base protocol witnessed a precipitous fall in gas fees, from $0.31 to an almost negligible $0.0005. Similarly, Optimism has seen transaction costs plummet to under $0.01, as reported by L2Fees. These advancements follow closely on the heels of the Dencun update’s activation on the Ethereum mainnet on March 13, which introduced a groundbreaking enhancement in the form of EIP-4844. This essential upgrade, by facilitating a new type of transaction for blobs, is set not only to decimate layer-2 transaction costs by tenfold but also to significantly boost the overall throughput of Ethereum. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

Share this article Over $50 million in PEPE and FLOKI were accumulated by smart money traders over the last 7 days Nansen data shows that the biggest PEPE and FLOKI buyer has almost 35% of his portfolio consisted of meme coins. PEPE and FLOKI were the two preferred Ethereum-based meme coins from smart money traders in the last seven days, according to on-chain data platform Nansen. PEPE registered $48.8 million in smart money inflows in the period, while FLOKI got $4.3 million in investments. The largest PEPE buyer in the past seven days is a “Smart DEX Trader”, which is a label created by Nansen to address the most profitable on-chain traders. He holds over $1.2 million in PEPE at the time of writing, which represents 15% of his holdings. Moreover, he made the largest FLOKI buy of the past week, adding $1 million to his portfolio. The wallet also holds Shiba Inu (SHIB), nearing $700,000 of this meme coin. Those three tokens represent almost 35% of this trader’s portfolio. Another address labeled as a Smart DEX Trader also accumulated over $1.2 million in the same period, which is 5.6% of his portfolio. This address also holds $1.7 million of the DEGEN meme coin, which amounts to 13% of his holdings. Aside from smart money, wallets created in 1000 days or less have accumulated over $1.1 billion in PEPE, while FLOKI received $129 million in investments for the past seven days. Furthermore, it seems that the meme coin fever is gearing up again. Solana, the most popular ecosystem for meme coin launches, registered a new daily all-time high for new tokens on May 4, with 14,648 tokens launched that day.

386::https://theconversation.com/is-your-computer-secretly-mining-bitcoin-alternatives-a-guide-to-cryptojacking-89198::The Conversation::article::Is your computer secretly mining bitcoin alternatives? A guide to ‘cryptojacking’::The Pirate Bay is among those accused of using customers’ computers to mine cryptocurrency.::Nothing comes for free, especially online. Websites and apps that don’t charge you for their services are often collecting your data or bombarding you with advertising. Now some sites have found a new way to make money from you: using your computer to generate virtual currencies. Several video streaming sites and the popular file sharing network The Pirate Bay have allegedly been “cryptojacking” their users’ computers in this way, as has the free wifi provider in a Starbucks cafe in Argentina. Users may object to this, especially if it slows down their computers. But given how hard it is for most companies to make money from online advertising, it might be something we have to get used to – unless we want to start paying more for things. Units of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin aren’t created by a central bank like regular money but are generated or “mined” by computers solving complex equations. Cryptojacking involves using someone’s computer without their knowledge, perhaps for just seconds at a time, to mine a cryptocurrency. In the case of bitcoin, mining requires specialised hardware and consumes masses of energy. For example, each bitcoin transaction takes enough energy to boil around 36,000 kettles filled with water. In a year, the whole bitcoin mining network consumes more energy than Ireland. But bitcoin is not the only show in town and there are many competing cryptocurrences. One of the most successful is Monero, which builds a degree of privacy into transactions (something bitcoin doesn’t do). Currently it requires no specialised hardware for mining, so anyone with computing power to spare can mine it. Mining usually takes the form of a competition. Whichever computer solves the equation the fastest is rewarded with the money. With Moreno and other similar cryptocurrencies, a pool of computers can work together and share the reward if they win the competition. This allows individual computers to work on a just small part of the mining task. The larger the pool, the more chance there is of winning the reward. When a computer is cryptojacked, it is added to a pool for to work on the task. This is often done using a commercially available piece of software, such as Coinhive, which can written into what looks like an ad using the common website language JavaScript. As the ad runs in the background, the computer is added to a pool. This means the website or internet provider doing the cryptojacking can mine cryptocurrency with little cost to themselves. One estimate is that 220 of the top 1,000 websites in the world are conducting cryptojacking, making a total of US$43,000 over a three week period. This might not be very much but file-sharing sites in particular have been searching for new businesses models in order to support their operations and cryptojacking could grow into a new income source. The problem for the computer’s owner is that this takes up processor power, making other operations take much longer. Pirate Bay users have complained that their processors have been using up to 85% of their capacity compared with less than 10% for normal operations. This can be accompanied by a large battery drain. The Pirate Bay has since said this high processor usage was a bug and the system should normally use between 20% and 30% of processing power. Coinhive strongly advises the websites that deploy it that they should inform users they are being cryptojacked. But it’s common for the code to run without users realising and without a way to opt out of it. If you want to prevent your computer from being cryptojacked you need a software tool which checks the code as it runs such as an ad-blocker. But you might feel that allowing a site to use a little bit of your computer’s processing power is a better alternative to being bombarded with advertising. Whatever you do, you’ll likely end up paying for “free” services somehow.::2017-12-19T11:47:46Z::Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency::Bill Buchanan::Home::https://images.theconversation.com/files/199787/original/file-20171218-27544-1no0fzc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

389::https://blockworks.co/news/paypal-research-explores-bitcoin-mining-clean-energy::Blockworks::article::PayPal research proposes greener bitcoin mining::A PayPal research group released a report late Monday on how economic incentives could spur bitcoin miners to use cleaner energy.::The scheme would lock extra bitcoin in transactions that only environmentally friendly miners can unlock rzoze19/Shutterstock and Adobe modified by Blockworks An internal research group at PayPal released a report late Monday on how economic incentives could spur bitcoin miners to use cleaner energy. Bitcoin’s proof-of-work consensus mechanism has drawn criticism from environmental groups and legislators for being computationally intensive. The PayPal report suggests solving this problem by stashing extra bitcoin rewards in certain transactions for miners using low-carbon energy sources. Bitcoin miners are paid with bitcoin for their computational labor under PoW, and PayPal’s report would shuttle a little extra bitcoin to environmentally conscious miners. Read more: This Bitcoin halving cycle, miners need a new energy strategy The program starts with identifying so-called green miners who use clean energy or have a limited impact on energy grids, as defined by the platform Energy Web. Green miners’ public keys, which are cryptographic hashes that allow miners to receive their bitcoin rewards, are identified as “green keys.” To reward green miners, certain bitcoin transactions would have a UTXO with a multisig wallet holding extra bitcoin. This multisig wallet can only be accessed by green keys. These transactions will also have lower-than-average fees, making them more appealing for green miners, who can unlock the wallet with their green keys, to include in a block. The report likens the program to paying an “indirect grant” to bitcoin miners using cleaner energy. Read more: Why did Cambridge revise its bitcoin electricity consumption index? One potential tradeoff in the scheme is that non-green miners could still pick up earmarked transactions if the low fees aren’t a deterrent. The report also recommends “removing” any malicious green miners who may try to drive up the transaction fees on green transactions for their own gain. Not everyone in the Bitcoin community immediately loved PayPal’s idea. “Bitcoin doesn’t need wonky schemes, miners are already building renewables & cutting methane & toxic waste,” Magdalena Gronowska, advisor to energy recycling project PRTI, said on X. Gronowska pointed out that despite the recent halving, bitcoin fees are still relatively high, and PayPal’s scheme relies on miners picking lower fees in exchange for a subsidy. Read more: Bitcoin memecoins pushed fees higher than block rewards for first time The report does not give a specific amount for the “subsidy,” only saying the green miner multisig would contain “some bitcoins.” If PayPal’s public mempool solution doesn’t work, smart contracts or the Lightning Network could be used to privately send green miners extra rewards, the report notes, adding that doing so would require a level of trust. The report was authored by PayPal’s Blockchain Research Group, an internal group that PayPal has said began work around 2015. The researchers tested aspects of the incentivization program with blockchain company DMG. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

This increase is part of a larger bullish trend in the cryptocurrency sector, propelling the overall market capitalization to an impressive $2.7 trillion. The rise in Ethereum’s price was, however, short-lived as it dipped back to $3,900 shortly after, a result of traders quickly capitalizing on their profits. The recent price trajectory of ETH mirrors the wider optimistic outlook within the crypto market. Despite this positive momentum, Ethereum’s trading volume saw a modest rise of 10% today, hinting at the decision of long-term investors to retain their holdings rather than sell. In this wave of market highs, Bitcoin too shattered records by reaching a new all-time high of $70,000. Similarly, Ethereum-based meme tokens, like Shiba Inu, recorded remarkable growth, with SHIB’s value soaring by more than 150% on a weekly basis. The buzz surrounding Ethereum can be attributed in part to the anticipation of the forthcoming Dencun upgrade, scheduled for launch next Wednesday. This update is anticipated to significantly boost Ethereum’s scalability and efficiency. Successful implementation could lead to further increases in ETH’s value. The Dencun upgrade represents a pivotal moment for Ethereum, aiming to solve several of the network’s persistent issues. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

Shiba Inu is building an ecosystem Layer 3: Opportunities and challenges Memecoins may outperform top altcoins this season, but there’s a catch::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Despite a shaky 2022 and a challenging 2023, Shiba Inu remains dedicated to its vision of building a comprehensive crypto ecosystem. Following the development of its metaverse and layer 2 chain, Shiba Inu is now ramping up efforts for its new privacy-centric layer 3 blockchain. Last month, the project team announced that it successfully raised $12 million through the sale of its not-yet-released token, TREAT, the utility and governance token for its layer 3 chain. Bill Qian, Chairman of Cypher Capital, one of the initiative’s major backers, recently joined Crypto Briefing to discuss the future of memecoins, layer 3, and Shiba Inu’s role in reshaping the future of finance and decentralized governance. Crypto Briefing – Cypher Capital’s investment in Shiba Inu suggests your belief in the potential of the project. Can you elaborate on aspects of the project or roadmap that you find particularly promising for the future? Bill Qian – Our decision to invest in Shiba Inu aligns with our mission to usher the next generation into the cryptosphere. Shiba’s unique approach, particularly its ambitious plans to build a Layer 3 and establish a network state—a concept that hasn’t been fully explored in the crypto world—captured our attention. The prospect of experimenting with novel models and pushing the limits of decentralized systems excites us. As participants in the crypto space, we find Shiba Inu’s dedication to building a dynamic community, forming strategic partnerships, and promoting inclusive governance inspiring. We are optimistic that Shiba Inu will pioneer a movement that will reshape the future of finance and decentralized governance. Crypto Briefing – Shiba Inu has a passionate community. Do you see this community engagement as a key factor in the success of meme coins? Bill Qian – Without a doubt, community engagement plays a pivotal role in the success of meme coins like Shiba Inu. Shiba is still one of the most decentralized projects out there, with over 1 million on-chain holders—this is massive. The passionate and active community surrounding Shiba not only drives awareness and adoption but also contributes to the project’s ongoing development and evolution. Recently, we observed Shiba moving up in ranking from the top 30 to the top 10 for a brief period during the early meme season this year. This wouldn’t have been possible if the community wasn’t excited about the token’s future potential. Crypto Briefing – Do you see meme coins potentially evolving beyond their current form and offering more utility within the blockchain space? How might you envision this happening with Shiba Inu’s layer 3 blockchain? Bill Qian – Absolutely. Community engagement is key to a project’s success, and Shiba Inu has already shown its strength in building a supportive community around its meme. I see Shiba evolving beyond just a memecoin; it’s becoming an ecosystem. Unlike its peers, Shiba Inu is committed to building around its community and expanding its utility beyond being a meme. Over the past three years, the team has been focused on developing innovations to strengthen the community and solidify its position as a top token. With the introduction of Shiba Inu’s Layer 3 blockchain, we’re excited about the real-world applications that will soon deploy on Treats – Shiba’s Layer 3 that powers the network state. This opens up new possibilities for Shiba to offer practical solutions and utility within the blockchain space. Crypto Briefing – Speaking of layer 3 blockchain, how do you think this layered approach can revolutionize the way dApps are built and used? Bill Qian – I believe the layered approach to blockchain infrastructure development holds immense potential to revolutionize the way dApps are built in the future. By allocating specific functions to different layers, developers can optimize each layer for its intended purpose while leveraging the strengths of the others. We’re already seeing this evolution in action, with Web3 games building their own layer 3 solutions to customize their chains according to their specific requirements while leveraging the security and scalability provided by existing layer 1s and layer 2s. In the future, I envision every project within a niche having a purpose-driven layer 3 to power its ecosystem, resulting in greater efficiency, and flexibility in the development and utilization of dApps. Crypto Briefing – While layer 3 offers immense opportunity, what are some potential challenges you think we might face in terms of infrastructure development and interoperability between these layers? Bill Qian – One of the significant challenges with any new infrastructure is the cold start problem, which arises from a lack of users and developers in the space. We are in the attention economy of crypto, where projects compete for visibility and adoption, and this can pose a significant hurdle. Moreover, as projects increasingly focus on building their own layer 3 solutions, interoperability and compatibility between these layers may become more complex. This fragmentation could lead to confusion for end-users and hinder the seamless integration and interaction of dApps across different layers. Addressing these challenges will require collaboration among projects, standardization of protocols, and efforts to educate and onboard users and developers to new infrastructure solutions. This will take time, but we are optimistic that such layers will be common and widely used in crypto in the future. Crypto Briefing – Do you think layer 3 has the potential to bridge the gap between traditional applications and blockchain technology? Bill Qian – I believe layer 3 solutions will continue to be built and deployed. Whether they will be successful in bridging the gap between traditional apps and blockchain depends on the purpose, usability and execution of the team. Success will rely on factors like user-friendliness, scalability, and compatibility with existing ecosystems. I think, ultimately, it all comes down to how people embrace and use these technologies in real-world scenarios. Crypto Briefing – Do you see a potential shift in VC investment strategies towards meme coins, even if they don’t necessarily align with traditional solid projects? Bill Qian – Not necessarily. While Cypher Capital maintains its core focus on investing in blockchain infrastructure, we acknowledge the significance of memes in capturing market attention. Our investment in Shiba Inu exemplifies this balance. Shib’s unique position as both a meme and a project developing infrastructure aligns with our strategy of striking a balance between attention and technology. Crypto Briefing – In your experience, how does the current bull cycle differ from previous ones in terms of meme coin mania? How long do you think it will take VCs to adapt to this shift? Bill Qian – Investors are directing liquidity towards attention-grabbing projects, and it’s essential to acknowledge the increasing interest from retail investors in memes during this cycle. From my experience, we’ve witnessed two previous cycles where retail investors saw substantial returns. However, the bear market of the last two years has left many retail investors more cautious before diving into projects. This season will be different — maybe memes may outperform top altcoins but it is very tricky for investors to adapt to this shift. Regardless of the short trends, it is important to diligently study market dynamics to understand what drives these shifts and determine where it makes sense to take calculated risks. While meme-driven projects may present opportunities for significant gains, every investor should remain committed to their investment principles and conduct thorough analysis before making any investment decisions and impulsively adapting to new shifts.

392::https://theconversation.com/bitcoins-energy-use-is-out-of-control-but-maybe-thats-the-point-89133::The Conversation::article::Bitcoin’s energy use is out of control … but maybe that’s the point?::The extra energy used to mine and transfer Bitcoins may simply be a price the currency has to pay for being secure and anonymous.::The soaring value of bitcoin is encouraging more and more companies and individuals to engage in “mining”. Mining is actually a process which secures the distributed bitcoin network, and processes all of its transactions. Historically anyone could do this using a standard PC, but these days hardware that is purpose-built for more energy-efficient mining is a necessity to mine profitably. Every ten minutes miners across the globe compete to the be the first to solve a mathematical puzzle. The winner gets the “block reward”, which is currently 12.5 bitcoins (at the time of writing worth more than US$200,000). As the amount of mining activity increases, earlier concerns about bitcoin’s global energy consumption have become all the more prescient. However, it’s difficult to accurately estimate just how much energy is used, what the unit cost of that energy is, or whether its source was renewable. Nonetheless, one ongoing estimate says the total energy consumption of bitcoin adds up to almost 4GW (Gigawatts). That means the digital currency uses roughly as much energy as bulgaria. Yet even this is likely to be too small a figure, given such estimates focus on the electricity used for mining and ignore the energy (and associated carbon emissions) that go into building and transporting new mining hardware, and then replacing it with the latest models every six months to a year. Assuming bitcoin consumes about 4GW, then this would equate to about 1% of the electricity demand that goes into digital services and devices globally, or about 0.1% of total global electricity demand. Headlines about bitcoin’s energy footprint tell us how many kettles we can boil or how many miles we can drive per transaction. Whichever way we look at it, the answer is “a lot”. But while these figures help us relate the network and its transactions to everyday experiences, they don’t unpack why bitcoin is so energy intensive, whether using all this energy is “worth it”, nor do they point to future possibilities or alternatives. To illustrate the problem with comparisons, consider iPads. To manufacture and transport an iPad to a customer has roughly the same carbon footprint as 225 sausages. Intuitively this seems like an excessively large pile of sausage, but it says nothing about the iPads’ share in overall consumer electronics sales, the typical useful lifetime of an iPad, how many sausages might be consumed in that time, nor the meaning and utility that people derive from iPads, relative to sausages. We have to put bitcoin’s energy consumption into context: how much it consumes compared to other uses of computing power, what value or benefit mining creates (and for whom), and consequently what the appropriate alternatives might be. Bitcoin is often compared to rivals like Visa, which manages far more transactions each of which uses much less energy. However, such “per transaction” comparisons are more complex than they might appear. Yes, it’s true that the computers required to “mine” digital coins actually use more energy, and ultimately create more carbon emissions, per unit of value created than the machines and resources used to print and mint traditional currency. When viewed like this bitcoin still seems wasteful. However, bitcoin advocates would argue that’s an inevitable result of what makes cryptocurrency different. Unlike other forms of currency (say, the British pound) there is no central issuing authority. And unlike payment processors (say, Visa) there is no corporate core. The bitcoin network is designed to be distributed but secure, and is agnostic to energy consumption. In a world where bitcoin is considered a valuable asset, as it currently is, a significant – and growing – burden on global energy consumption is inevitable. One alternative to the computationally (and electrically) expensive puzzles that underpin the mining process is a technology called proof-of-stake. Although technically viable, such a change would be controversial given that expensive bitcoin mining hardware would almost certainly be made redundant. Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto is estimated to hold 1m coins (more than US$19 billion at today’s prices), while the overall network has “created” more than US$310 billion for miners. In wealth creation terms the digital currency experiment therefore appears to have been a success. Such success is a double edged sword though, as it has led three quarters of global mining being controlled by as few as five organisations (arguably undermining bitcion’s aim of decentralisation) and the environmental impact of the network’s unavoidable energy consumption is clearly problematic. Unless bitcoin changes to proof-of-stake the bubble is likely to end either in a financial or environmental catastrophe.::2017-12-19T16:48:24Z::Bitcoin, Energy efficiency, Global warming::Bingsheng Zhang::Environment::https://images.theconversation.com/files/199719/original/file-20171218-27585-1hhh05b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C861%2C5184%2C2592&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
393::https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/05/16/crypto-and-defi-wallet-firm-fordefi-gets-cover-from-insurance-giant-munich-re/::CoinDesk::article::Crypto and DeFi Wallet Firm Fordefi Gets Cover from Insurance Giant Munich Re::Insurance broker Lockton’s Emerging Asset Protection (LEAP) team helped organize the Munich Re deal.::Fordefi, a cryptocurrency wallet built for decentralized finance (DeFi), is working with German insurance giant Munich Re, the companies said in a blog post on Thursday. Facilitated by Kansas City-headquartered insurance broker Lockton, Fordefi’s wallet policy covers cyberattacks and things like internal fraud or collusion, as opposed to protection at the smart contract level. The dollar amount of the coverage was not disclosed, but as well as the general level of cover for Fordefi’s wallet – which uses clever key sharing capabilities known as multi-party computation (MPC) – customers can top up with more cover from Munich Re on an individual basis. DeFi’s fast-moving collection of decentralized, on-chain trading platforms has been described as a “playground for hackers,” making it a tough ask for even the most digital asset-focused insurer. But Fordefi CEO Josh Schwartz said the new product had naturally led to deeper explorations into the DeFi arena for Munich Re, with more to come in due course. Schwartz was previously chief operating officer at Curv, the MPC shop acquired by PayPal back in 2021, which was an early crypto custody firm to work with Munich Re. “The policy covers external cyber threats and attacks that would compromise the platform, as well as internal fraud or employee collusion,” Schwartz said in an interview. “[Munich Re] is not involved at the smart contract level, but is getting involved with the most active players in DeFi, starting with a framework that they are comfortable with, i.e. the security of the private keys and the wallet components.” When it comes to smart contract risks, the blockchain lead at Lockton’s Emerging Asset Protection (LEAP) Sarah Downey said the insurance industry is moving in the right direction. In terms of what’s out there in the market, Chainproof has offered cover to DeFi users for technical failure of the code, and there’s the popular decentralized capital pool approach created by Nexus Mutual.

395::https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-memecoins-fees-vs-block-rewards::Blockworks::article::Bitcoin memecoins pushed fees higher than block rewards for first time::For the first time ever, bitcoin miners in a single 24-hour period earned more in fees than in block rewards.::Miners may not have even noticed the halving took place over the weekend, with fees largely making up the difference so far Shutterstock AI and Adobe modified by Blockworks After memecoin mania cycles were speed-run on Solana and Base, this weekend was Bitcoin’s turn, and a new network milestone came along with it. For the first time ever, bitcoin miners in a single 24-hour period earned more in fees than in block rewards. On Saturday — just after the halving and the launch of token minting protocol Runes — miners raked in $80.74 million in fees and $26.28 million in bitcoin. That has never happened before, according to Token Terminal data. The day after also came close, with fees making up nearly 80% of all miner revenue. Prior to this weekend, the closest fees that had come to flipping the block reward was during the peak bull market in December 2017: $21.1 million to $27.3 million. It also almost happened on Monday, May 8, 2023, with fees making up 42.6% of the total miner revenue for the day. Runes, a new protocol for minting memecoins from Ordinals creator Casey Rodarmor, was released at the same block height as last Friday’s halving. Not for any technical reason — just it made for a neat countdown. A slew of Rune mints immediately came online, and average transaction fees hit an all-time high of nearly $130, per BitInfoCharts, more than double the previous record from the last bull market. About 53,000 Runes-related transactions were recorded in the first two hours, roughly one-third more than the overall network’s usual numbers across February and March. Read more: Bitcoin Runes look to spice up the halving party Runes made up more than half of all Bitcoin activity on Saturday and Sunday, which explains why fees went berserk. People were willing to splurge to use the chain, as long as it meant minting the first Runes to hit the network. Now, Runes are down to about 30% of Bitcoin transactions and fees have fallen to about $11 for high priority. Runes are fungible memecoins that exist entirely on-chain. With Ordinals, special data (images, sounds, videos, text, browser-compilable code and so on) is written to individual satoshis (sats), imbuing them with non-BTC properties to make them unique and non-fungible. Those sats become Ordinals, which can then be traded on NFT marketplaces alongside other unique digital collectibles on Ethereum, Solana and other blockchains. Read more: Solana breaks $200 as memecoin and airdrop interest continue Pseudonymous developer Domo riffed on Ordinals to create an experimental token standard for fungible assets, BRC-20. Instead of images or videos, sats are inscribed with a JSON list of variables, including a ticker and max supply, technically making those Ordinals part of a larger, independent BRC-20 supply with its own market. Domo had effectively hacked Ordinals to create lo-fi memecoins — while Bitcoin’s Taproot upgrade had been hacked to create lo-fi NFTs. A cypherpunk tradition. By contrast, Rodarmor intends Runes to be more lightweight. Instructions for Runes are attached to UTXOs rather than individual sats, which means Runes (memecoins) can be ported to the Lightning Network or other similar projects in the future. SatScreener, a portal tracking the implied market caps of Runes ($4.5 billion), has listed more than 7,000 different memecoins, most of them practically worthless, including: Bitcoin’s $130 transaction fees, even fleeting, are still absurd in crypto’s current age of low-cost prioritization before decentralization, trustlessness and even liveness. Whether high Bitcoin fees are bad, however, depends largely on one’s vantage point. There are likely few complaints among miners, who as a cohort just took a 50% haircut on the block reward at the halving. On standard 10-minute block times, miners now earn 450 BTC ($29.7 million) per day, down from 900 BTC ($59.4 million). A hypothetical trader who spent $50 to mint some Runes, which they then sold for much much more down the line largely wouldn’t care, either. For someone using Bitcoin to protect their net worth from inflation, $100 fees would be infuriating. It’s practically impossible to know how many people fit into that scenario, but in any case, memecoins are surely pricing out those who need bitcoin most — particularly those with low balances. Read more: Why is 2140 the end of bitcoin inflation? And that may always be the reality of Bitcoin. It’s expensive to use. It might have to be to plug lost revenue resulting from the four-year halving schedule unless electricity for whatever reason suddenly becomes much less pricey. That’s probably okay in a very broad sense; people who want to cheaply move value across borders can send and receive USDT on cheaper networks. And fees might have to rise even higher in future cycles, especially without abundant and low-cost energy. Ignoring the plight of miners in favor of users, the general consensus is there’s not much anyone can do outside of pushing activity to the Lightning Network, or raising the block size limit, which is still a touchy subject. Bitcoin layer-2s could hypothetically help, but it’s largely dependent on the trust profiles of those networks, as well as how users operate in the future. Besides, the current crop of Bitcoin layer-2s are all in preliminary development stages, so any potential benefits are far in the future. Read more: How will the Bitcoin halving impact Bitcoin L2s? High Bitcoin fees hurt even more with the knowledge that banal stuff like CASEYS-MOM-HAS-GOT-IT-GOING-ON is driving them higher. But at this point, it just is what it is.

Glassnode data reveals a substantial shift in Ethereum’s blockchain towards deflation, influenced by lessened validator engagement and more network activity. A significant number of validators have left the Ethereum staking pool since October, slowing down the rate at which ETH is issued. This slowdown aligns with a generally bullish outlook in the digital asset markets. Lowered validator activity reduces ETH issuance, and when paired with increased network activity, it leads to more ETH being burned via EIP1559. Meanwhile, NFT and DeFi transactions have declined by 3% and 57% respectively in the last four months. Conversely, the usage of tokens and stablecoins has increased, with token-related gas usage rising by 8.2% and stablecoin gas usage up by 19%. This points to a trend towards longer-tail assets and indicates a rise in market confidence. Since the London hardfork, Ethereum has moved from a state of net inflation to a balanced state and now to deflation. The recent mix of reduced issuance rates and a higher volume of ETH being burned has led to a deflationary state for the overall ETH supply once again. These changes highlight Ethereum’s sensitivity to market movements and adoption patterns. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

397::https://cryptobriefing.com/meme-coin-leverage-analysis/::Crypto Briefing::article::Meme coins dominate altcoin leverage, Kaiko reports::Meme coins outpace Bitcoin Cash in leverage, with Pepe and Dogwifhat leading.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Pepecoin (PEPE) and Dogwifhat (WIF) have emerged as the leaders in leverage usage within the altcoin sector, a recent report by Kaiko shows. The open interest to market cap ratio, a key indicator of leverage, shows that these meme coins have ratios twice that of other altcoins. This suggests that price discovery for these tokens is heavily concentrated in perpetual futures markets. PEPE and WIF registered stellar upward movements of 510% and 1,880% this year, respectively. Moreover, they are amongst the 40 largest altcoins by market cap, which is a major feat. For comparison, WIF and PEPE are bigger than every Ethereum layer-2 blockchain’s native token, except Polygon’s MATIC. Despite major altcoins fighting to show a positive performance in the last seven days, PEPE and WIF are up 21% and 28% at the time of writing, respectively. Boomer (BOOMER) and Gigachad (GIGA) are the top gainers in this period, rising 121% and 96%. As reported by Crypto Briefing, country-themed coins are also exhibiting significant returns recently, as the Olympic Games in Paris inch closer. The USA meme coin reached its all-time high on May 4, with a 74,000% since its launch. Moreover, Filecoin (FIL), which experienced a surge after integrating with Solana, ranks third in leverage use, followed by Bitcoin Cash (BCH).

398::https://theconversation.com/the-bank-of-england-is-planning-a-bitcoin-style-virtual-currency-but-could-it-really-replace-cash-89585::The Conversation::article::The Bank of England is planning a bitcoin-style virtual currency – but could it really replace cash?::National cryptocurrencies could make payments faster and prevent crime, but they come with their own risks.::Governments are extremely worried about cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. These virtual currencies mean you can make payments without involving the banks that most economies and government financial models are built on. People can transfer large amounts of money without the authorities knowing, potentially making it easier to evade tax or launder money. So several countries’ central banks, including the Bank of England and the Bank of Israel, are reportedly planning to launch their own digital currencies. This could help lure people back into using an official system that combines some of the benefits of both traditional and crypto- currencies. But the risks involved may be too great for many typical cash users to bear. One of the major drawbacks of existing cryptocurrencies is that their value tends to swing widely and it is often difficult to pinpoint how much they are really worth. National cryptocurrencies would be tied to the value of the country’s official currency, making them less volatile and easier to actually use as a way of spending. National cryptocurrencies would also make payments much faster because transactions would be recorded instantly and wouldn’t have to be cleared by a bank (although some implementations require around eight minutes to be verified). The existing systems for electronic payments and transfers can often involve several banks and companies sending each other data and running security checks that add time and expense to transactions. Cryptocurrencies are able to bypass this clearing process altogether because they don’t actually involve transfers from one entity to another. Instead they use a technology known as a blockchain, which keeps a public but encrypted record of all transactions. Basically, as illustrated in the figure below, the payer (in this case, Bob) signs a transaction to agree to pay someone (Alice) a given amount. The transaction is then validated using Bob’s personal encryption code known as his “private key”. If the transaction is valid, it is added onto the blockchain, recording how much money Alice and Bob now have. Because all transactions would be recorded in this way, the government would have much greater oversight of who is paying whom and how much, helping to crack down on financial crime. Unfortunately, because transactions on blockchain ledger are typically kept as a public record, it might also be possible for other people to access this information and see how much you or anyone else is spending and what you’re buying. Your money might also be at greater risk if it’s stored as a cryptocurrency. Currently banks guard your wealth and will always release it if you can prove your identity, while credit card companies insure you against fraud. If your bank account is hacked, there is a good chance you will get your money back. But cryptocurrencies store money in independent digital wallets that can be lost or broken into. If that happens there is no one who can help you. For a typical shopper, there would be little difference between using a national cryptocurrency and something like Apple Pay, which makes payments at the click of a trusted application on a mobile device. I love using Apple Pay on my iPhone to purchase my coffee in the morning, as well as my bus tickets and even my parking. I now have little use of cash and only carry around my credit cards in a wallet as a backup in case my battery fails. Having found out over Christmas that most supermarkets now do not have a limit on Apple Pay, I see it as one of the most trusted methods of payment, especially as I trust the fingerprint scanner on my phone. I also know that my bank is involved in the transaction. So I believe the days of paper money – and even carrying around cards – are rapidly fading. Our mobile phone and our trust in our apps provide us with more trusted ways of making transactions. But Apple Pay is still backed up by trusted financial institutions. The step to cryptocurrency may be one step too far for most people. Few people would actually understand the risks of storing the cryptocurrency in a digital wallet and could leave themselves open to losing all their money. I believe that most countries will deal with cryptocurrencies by regulating them and monitoring their use rather than co-opting them. But it will be interesting to see whether regulation or competition will win in the battle of crytocurrencies. While the encryption of crytocurrencies can create strong digital trust in the technology, human trust in the transactions themselves will likely be the key factor that determines whether citizens adopt government-backed cryptocurrencies.::2018-01-03T13:15:17Z::Bank of England, Bitcoin, Central banks, Cryptocurrency, Currencies, Currency, Digital currencies, Online currencies, Virtual currencies::Bill Buchanan::Home::https://images.theconversation.com/files/200674/original/file-20180103-26166-17d08zw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

The token racked up $294 million in trading volume within the first hour of trading, according to CoinMarketCap. Early adopters of the game, which can be accessed via the Telegram app, accumulated notcoin from January to April by clicking on a virtual coin and completing challenges within the game. In-game balances have been converted on a 1000:1 ratio, according to a press release. Notcoin's maximum supply is 102 billion, with 3% allocated to Binance Launchpool users and a further 1.5% set aside for OKX Jumpstart users. The project has also introduced a staking mechanism to incentivize airdrop farmers to hold their tokens. Staking will be required to "earn extra rewards" and gain access to more lucrative staking pools based on the player’s level in the game. “It’s been an amazing few months,” said Sasha Plotvinov, founder of notcoin developers Open Builders. “We’re extremely proud that Notcoin’s viral growth has introduced millions to crypto and TON’s ecosystem."

401::https://blockworks.co/news/post-bitcoin-halving-price-predictions::Blockworks::article::With halving just hours away, bitcoin price predictions proliferate ::Many analysts and executives have weighed in on what this roughly quadrennial event will spur from a bitcoin price action standpoint.::Short-term “sell the news” reactions could follow new BTC price peaks months from now, industry watchers say — but only if history repeats itself Kevin McGovern/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks We are now just hours away from the Bitcoin halving. If you still don’t know what that means, now’s the time to clear that up. In short, the issuance of new bitcoin per block is set to drop from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. While many analysts and executives have weighed in on what this roughly quadrennial event will spur from a bitcoin price action standpoint, what we know is that nobody knows for sure. Segment observers have looked at the three past halvings in 2012, 2016 and 2020 for help — though that isn’t exactly a large sample size. Besides, some have pointed out that this time is different considering the approval of US spot bitcoin ETFs just months before the event. Demand for those products helped fuel a crypto rally and a new all-time high BTC price above $73,000 last month. Read more: The history of Bitcoin halvings — and why this time might look different We’ve heard it from many on repeat in recent days, weeks and months: Bitcoin halvings tend to catalyze crypto bull markets. But Framework Ventures co-founder Michael Anderson noted that previous bitcoin halving cycles suggest the event’s potential impact might not become apparent for 12 to 18 months from now. “While halvings tend to get plenty of media attention, and also serve as a timely reminder of the importance of bitcoin’s limited money supply, the reduction in supply issuance hasn’t historically had an immediate effect on the crypto markets,” Anderson said. But as mentioned, pre-halving bitcoin price action broke the mold by hitting a new record just weeks before the event, which Anderson said “implies that old models are likely less reliable.” “It’s entirely possible that newer, more institutional market entrants that were onboarded through the ETFs are perhaps less jaded and more excited about halvings, and so the timeline for a market upswing might come sooner than expected,” he added. Everyone knows when a Bitcoin halving is coming, with this one occurring at block 840,000. One might assume that means the upcoming halving is reflected in bitcoin’s current price. BTC hovered around $64,000 at 1 pm ET Friday — down about 8% from a week ago. “Digital asset investors and traders constantly ask the question, ‘Is the halving priced in,’ and each cycle it tends to not be,” said Matt Ballensweig, head of BitGo’s Go Network. While bitcoin’s price went up prior to the SEC’s approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in January, it rallied further in the 60 days afterward, he added. “With the halving, traders might try [to] position themselves ahead of the event,” Ballensweig said. “But when the event occurs, there will be less daily supply on the exchange order books, and assuming constant demand, that will again lead to bid-side pressure as the sell-side is thinner.” The Bitcoin halving is “never priced in,” according to Andreas Brekken, a former Kraken software engineer and founder of SideShift.ai. Bitcoin ETF investors — many of which are paying attention to the halving for the first time — will be reminded of bitcoin’s scarcity, Brekken noted. Read more: If you still think bitcoin is scarce, you’re suffering from fiat brain “It may take months for this realization to sink in fully,” he said. “Based on this, I expect BTC to reach $200,000 in this cycle.” Matteo Greco, a research analyst at Fineqia International wrote in an April 15 research note that while previous halving events have historically been followed by nine to 12 months of uptrend, they have typically caused short-term “sell the news” reactions before and after the event. There has been increased profit-taking among both crypto and traditional ETF investors, he added. “This natural behavior follows seven months of continuous growth, suggesting the possibility of a downward trend in April or in one of the following months,” Greco previously told Blockworks. Read more: Why BTC’s record monthly growth streak could be in jeopardy While LMAX market strategist said he too agrees there is potential for a “sell-the-news reaction” immediate after the halving, such setbacks could proceed a quick rally toward $100,000. “The main differentiating factor this time around is that we have traditional markets as an audience,” Kruger told Blockworks. “This could alter the trading landscape in the sense that these new market participants will have an opportunity to learn more about bitcoin and its attractive properties that make it so exciting as an asset.” Samir Kerbage, chief investment officer of crypto asset manager Hashdex, said bitcoin could see a pullback to the mid-$50,000 range. That would fall in line with previous mid-cycle corrections of 30%, he noted. More bearish still, JPMorgan analysts have said they think bitcoin could drop to $42,000 after the halving. Optimism over the prospect for bitcoin’s price rising significantly by year-end in part is based on the assumption that spot bitcoin ETFs would continue at the same pace, they noted. The US BTC fund category, however, has seen net outflows in each of the last five days. There are also the bitcoin miners to consider. The halving reduces the per-block rewards they will receive, putting pressure on their profitability. Miners with less access to capital and less efficient fleets are particularly vulnerable, segment observers have said. Read more: Financial trouble for bitcoin miners: A look back, and ahead as the halving looms Kadan Stadelmann, chief technology officer of Komodo Platform, said he expects bitcoin could trade “sideways” for three months after the halving due to sell-offs from miners. But Wes Levitt, co-chief investment officer for Alpha Transform Holdings, argued that miner profit margins are higher than anticipated — meaning more muted sales of their BTC reserves. He also noted that the combined market capitalization of the largest stablecoins — tether (USDT), USDC and DAI — recently reached a record of about $146 billion. Levitt added: “With less selling pressure post-halving and cash ready to re-enter the market once halving concerns have passed, BTC price should accelerate quickly.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

According to Scopescan a data provider the foundation converted approximately $2.76 million worth of ETH into USDC through an Uniswap transaction. This information has been confirmed by Arkham Intelligences data. CoinMarketCap shows a decrease in the value of Ethereum with a 0.56% decline in the last hour a 3.8% drop over the past day and a 6.66% decrease over the week. While it is not certain if this sale directly caused the price dip it is worth noting that Ethereums value continued to decline after the transaction took place. Many individuals on Twitter have expressed concerns about this move as it may be seen as a signal. Some question why the foundation chose to exchange their ETH for a stablecoin. However it is important to consider that there could be reasons to market predictions behind this decision by the Ethereum Foundation. For example they may have had obligations requiring payment in USDC. Following this sale there was also a transfer of $3.23 million worth of USDC, to Safe (formerly known as Gnosis Safe Protocol) which’s a decentralized asset management platform built on top of Ethereum. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

Share this article A new niche spawned among meme coin traders recently: country coins. In anticipation of the Olympic Games set to happen in Paris in July, investors are betting that the event will boost the prices of different tokens with the names of countries. A dashboard created by the X user identified as The Nouner is tracking 47 different country coins, which registered a trading volume of almost $18 million in the last 24 hours, and have a shared total market cap of nearly $110 million. American Coin (USA) is close to $83 million valuation, which is the largest market cap of the bunch. According to DEX Screener, the USA has soared by over 74,000% since its inception on March 14 to its price peak on May 4. China Coin (CHINA) comes as the second largest country coin by a long stretch, showing a $5.8 million market cap. Nevertheless, CHINA showed 23,000% growth from its creation to its all-time high seen on March 14. Analyzing the last 24 hours, the recently deployed Palestine Coin (PALESTINE) holds the most significant growth as it leaps 764% at the time of writing. France Coin (FRA) and UK Coin (UK) are also showing relevant growth in the period, rising 120% and 145% respectively. The list of country coins even includes the Olumpec Terch (OLUMPC) meme coin, which combines the Olympics narrative with the trend of meme coins spelling names wrong. From the creation of its liquidity pool until its all-time high registered on May 5, OLUMPC soared 6,400%.

There were the charts that showed how the wealth gap between old and young was growing and how this was affecting mortgages and home ownership. Then there were the ones on how our workforce is changing (and how we’re discriminating in it) and what this means for unions. Charts have a way of showing us that we can be wrong about our thoughts on, say inequality in Australia and financial vulnerability. But it would be wrong of us to finish the year without just a few more charts, three in fact. We’re hearing a lot less of the “jobs and growth” and the “innovation” mantras from Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Treasurer Scott Morrison. Maybe Jesse Stein was right when she suggested at the start of 2017 that it was time to ditch the spin around innovation. It got a very small mention in the Federal Budget, but it’s been hard for the government to make it stick to other policies too. Speaking of other policies, there’s not much doing in jobs either. Despite the enthusiasm about recent unemployment figures, underemployment (where you can’t get enough hours despite having a job) remains high. For those who don’t have a full time job, like young people in the arts or services industry, it seems the pay off of casual work ain’t what it used to be either. So far, Amazon’s Australian launch has been a bit of a fizzer. But tales of impending retail “decimination” were everywhere this year.  At The Conversation, Gary Mortimer correctly predicted that Amazon won’t be the end of shopping as you know it. At least so far. But this isn’t the end of the story. The likes of JB Hi-Fi and Harvey Norman will likely feel the heat, considering Amazon’s scale. And shopping centres are already scrambling to offer customers something new. More worrying are the implications for Australia’s tax system and industrial relations given Amazon’s business model. Now that Amazon is finally here, it’s time to start thinking about what it means for our own habits. Should we “click and collect”? And what’s with everyone trying to sell you a subscription box? One Bitcoin, as of mid day on December 15, was worth about A$22,000. That could buy you more than 6,000 avocados (because who wants a house anyway), 1,375 kilograms of Vegemite, four Chinese crested dogs or a small to mid-sized car. Although you’d have to have at least two Bitcoins to buy a Tesla Model 3 Roadster, but as Tesla is not yet ready to deliver this model in Australia, you may want to wait until you only need one Bitcoin.  But of course Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency so unless you exchange it for cash at the right time, all these comparisons are meaningless. In fact we’re not quite sure how to value Bitcoin even though we know why the price might be skyrocketing and how much energy it is guzzling. All we can do is look back on bubbles and crashes of old and hope next year won’t see the worst case scenarios come true.::2017-12-17T19:21:39Z::Amazon, Bitcoin, Business, Economics, Growth, Infographic, Jobs, Politics, Three charts on::Jenni Henderson::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/199380/original/file-20171215-17878-p6wc9i.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C0%2C2995%2C1495&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

'Wave of demand'::Spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds debuted with a giant splash in January, quickly attracting billions of dollars of investment. But who was buying them and why have inflows stalled in recent weeks? Was it a fad that fizzled? For those looking to get excited about bitcoin's long-term prospects among large, professional investors, a new data point this week made another big splash: The U.S. state of Wisconsin's pension fund disclosed in a quarterly filing that it had stashed about $160 million into bitcoin ETFs from BlackRock and Grayscale by the end of March. Pensions are generally conservative with their investments and slow to embrace new things, and Wisconsin is not usually the land of flashy purchases. But if bitcoin is making inroads there – posting some of the investment industry's highest returns over the past decade no doubt helps – then there might be good reason to suspect the original cryptocurrency can keep expanding its investor base. "Wow, a state pension bought [BlackRock's bitcoin ETF] in the first quarter," Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas wrote in an immediate reaction on X. "Normally you don't get these big fish institutions [investing] for a year or so (when the ETF gets more liquidity)." He added: "Good sign, expect more, as institutions tend to move in herds." Over 500 institutional investors held one or more spot bitcoin ETFs as of the end of first quarter, which is well above the average of 200 for a newly launched ETF, Balchunas pointed out. Almost all types of institutions were represented, including private equity, insurance companies, brokerage accounts, among others, according to Bloomberg data. Investment advisers made up about 60% to the total and a quarter were hedge funds. Balchunas said that seeing all types of investors represented in the first quarter is unusual and is normally not seen until years after the launch of a new ETF. The biggest buyer turned out to be hedge fund Millennium Management, which allocated roughly 3% of its total assets into several funds, the majority into BlackRock's IBIT. It is important to realize that 13F filings only tell part of the story, and don't give any insight into why someone made an investment. Not all of these are long-term bets or even investments hinging on bitcoin's price rising. Some are undoubtedly from trading firms' market-making businesses, positions held so they can act as the other side on someone else's trade and then likely liquidated quickly. The filing is also backward-looking, and investments may have added to, reduced or completely reversed by the time the public sees this disclosure of positions held on March 31. Bitcoin's price has fallen since hitting a record high in March, possibly giving reason for firms to reduce their investments. The biggest surprise might be that a pension was involved, given the industry's aversion to risk and the potential for bureaucracy to prevent embracing something new like bitcoin ETFs (though bitcoin itself is 15 years old). In 2020, insurance giant Massachusetts Mutual bought $100 million worth of bitcoin and took a stake in crypto shop NYDIG, and the industry expected competitors to follow suit with similar moves – but that really didn't materialize in a big way. The introduction of bitcoin ETFs makes it easier, though – even if it might take time for more pensions to copy Wisconsin. Instead of buying bitcoin directly and then sorting out how to hold it safely, an investor (large or small) can simply buy an ETF that holds it. ETFs trade just like regular stocks; administrative concerns like custody are minimal or nonexistent. "Pensions typically have highly rigorous due diligence processes, which means it can take time when deciding to allocate to a new investment – particularly one in an emerging asset class," said Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store. The allocation from Wisconsin's board of investors within only a few months of the launch of the ETFs shows that institutions of that size can quickly get comfortable with the structure and liquidity of these funds, he said. "I expect to see more pensions follow suit, but it will be a slowly building wave of demand versus something that happens overnight," Geraci said. Kyle DaCruz, head of digital assets at VanEck, one of the issuers of the spot bitcoin ETFs, said the recent development shows pension plans are now comfortable investing in digital assets. "My assumptions would be that it will certainly help pensions and institutions get comfortable sooner, though I anticipate it being a relatively small number to start," he said. A representative for the Wisconsin investment board declined to comment. Pension funds are likely some of the most risk-averse investors in the industry as they are, by law, forced to "minimize the risk of large losses." Digital assets, some of the riskiest assets out there, are therefore not typically thought to be a great investment for retirement funds. This is also one reason why investment giant Vanguard is not letting clients buy spot bitcoin ETFs as the company doesn't see digital assets fitting into a long-term portfolio, like a retirement fund. News on Tuesday about the appointment of BlackRock's former head of ETFs, Samil Ramji, as Vanguard's CEO sparked chatter that the firm might change its stance on crypto, but Ramji said in an interview with Barron's on Wednesday that he has no intent of reversing Vanguard's decision to launch a spot bitcoin ETF. "Behind the scenes, I think a lot of investment committees at these bigger institutions are working through getting approvals for allocating funds to bitcoin. This sort of approval process doesn't happen overnight, however, meaning that it will take months and possibly years for this sort of institutional adoption of bitcoin to fully play out, but it's clearly happening," said Stephanie Vaughan, chief operating officer at Seven Seas Capital. "And, yes, it is different this time. With the stamp of approval not only from the federal government but also massive firms like BlackRock and Fidelity, the game has changed," she said.

407::https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-halving-runes-launch::Blockworks::article::Bitcoin Runes look to spice up the halving party::The bitcoin halving event will also mark the launch of Runes, a new standard for fungible tokens issued directly on Bitcoin.::Billed as a better BRC-20 fungible token standard, Bitcoin Runes launches tomorrow Maquette.pro/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks The halving of the bitcoin block reward isn’t the only thing happening on Bitcoin block #840,000 in the early hours of April 20. The event will also mark the launch of Runes, a new standard for fungible tokens issued directly on Bitcoin. Casey Rodarmor, the creator of Ordinals, developed Runes as an alternative to BRC-20, the first bitcoin fungible token system built on Ordinal inscriptions. Bitcoin was not designed to support such tokens, and BRC-20s only work with help from off-chain indexers that read the data inscribed, a suave way of saying “written to” individual satoshis — rather like shoving a square peg in a round hole. Read more: Satoshi-era Bitcoin code idea gets a boost from Taproot Wizards Like BRC-20s as they are used today, Runes are basically memecoins. Unlike BRC-20, Runes do not depend on the Ordinals mechanism of inscribing, Rodarmor said on X. Bitcoin‘s blockchain primarily operates on a system called UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs). Each transaction generates new UTXOs, which can be thought of as individual pieces of bitcoin that have not been spent after being created in a transaction. All the UTXOs are tracked by the network to ensure that new transactions are legitimate, meaning that the sender has the bitcoin they attempt to send. Read more: Bitcoin’s 21 million limit is a boomer myth “Runestones” are special messages stored in Bitcoin transaction outputs — essentially embedded scripts that specify what operations should be performed, like creating, minting or transferring runes. Each runestone corresponds to a UTXO. One consequence of the fact that balances are stored in UTXOs is they can readily be locked in Hashed Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs) meaning Runes can be easily integrated with the Bitcoin Lightning Network. This compatibility is expected to facilitate faster and cheaper transactions, expanding its utility and appeal, potentially giving the runes standard an edge. Ordinals have also been controversial for causing state bloat on the Bitcoin network, although they have been a boon for miners. Read more: Ordinals are driving up Bitcoin fees — but that may be good for the network The launch block coinciding with the halving was selected arbitrarily by Rodarmor. Unlike a soft fork, there’s nothing special about blocks after the halving that make it so. But with media attention focused on Bitcoin around the quadrennial milestone, it seemed like the perfect time to push runestones on-chain. “I’m highly skeptical of ‘serious’ tokens, but runes is without a doubt a ‘serious’ token protocol,” he said.

Lidos approach has been to involve a number of node operators to prevent any single group from having excessive control over staked ETH, which helps address concerns about centralization. However the risk of centralization still remains. If a dominant group of liquidity providers or node operators were to emerge it could create a vulnerability. Even establish a monopoly that goes against the broader interests of the Ethereum community. Following the Merge and Shanghai updates Ethereum, the worlds most prominent cryptocurrency has experienced an increase in centralization. JPMorgan has expressed concerns about declining staking returns. Another important aspect mentioned in their report is rehypothecation. This complex term refers to using liquidity tokens as collateral in DeFi protocols simultaneously. DeFi encompasses financial transactions conducted on the blockchain. Issues arise when there is a decline, in the value of a staked asset or when security and protocol problems arise. In circumstances rehypothecation can potentially trigger a series of forced sales that jeopardize the stability of the DeFi system. The report also highlights that as staking has become more prevalent Ethereums appeal in terms of yields has diminished compared to increasing yields offered by assets. The overall yield for staking has decreased from 7.3% prior to the Shanghai update to 5.5%. On a note data gathered in December after the Ethereum Merge update in September 2022 revealed a significant decrease in the networks energy consumption comparable to countries like Ireland and Austria. This reduction aligns with efforts to reduce carbon emissions associated with blockchain technology thus promoting environmental sustainability. Regarding the Dencun update scheduled for October 2023 Ethereums main developers have put forth the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP 7514). The proposal aims to slow down Ether staking giving the Ethereum community time to establish a viable reward system for those participating in network staking. ETH Market Update; Presently Ethereum (ETH) is valued at $1,629 indicating a 3.4% decline, over the course of one week. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 40.4. ETHs price is currently struggling to maintain its position at $1600 after encountering resistance at $1700. If it fails to sustain above $1600 there is a possibility that the price may further decline towards $1500. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

Yuga Labs’ efforts to regain its footing::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Yuga Labs, the team behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT collection, has initiated a company restructuring to prioritize its core crypto business, which includes the Otherside metaverse project, said Greg Solano, the company’s co-founder, in a recent post on X. gm, really tough day today. I am hellbent on transforming yuga and getting us back to our roots, and that means making hard decisions. by far the hardest is saying goodbye to some talented team members. here was my message to the team this morning. pic.twitter.com/gBkoNf2iK3 — Garga.eth (Greg Solano) 🍌 (@CryptoGarga) April 26, 2024 As part of the restructuring process, Yuga Labs has cut down its workforce, though the company hasn’t specified the number of employees affected. Solano said Yuga Labs “lost its way” and needs to become a “smaller, more agile, and cryptonative team.” “The creative-first spirit that drove this company from inception has been getting muddied by labyrinthine corporate processes. We work hard and we care but somehow end up with groups and committees. We plan more than we ship,” Solano stated. He referenced Yuga Lab’s early success as “playing the game on easy mode” when creator royalties on NFTs were booming. But the easy mode was over. Solano said Yuga Labs is now “in hard mode” – it is “going from zero to one” with the community’s incredible support. Solano also mentioned that Yuga Labs is spinning out other projects, including HV-MTL and Legends of the Mara (LoTM), to focus its gaming efforts on 3D Otherside. The company announced earlier this month that gamebuilder Faraway acquired the HV-MTL and LoTM brands. This is not the first time Yuga Labs has undergone restructuring. Last October, the company announced a reorganization and layoffs focused on its US employees. At that time, Yuga Labs had around 100 employees worldwide. Yuga Labs is announcing a restructuring that will better focus our team on our core priorities. While certain roles have been impacted, these changes are necessary to evolve as an organization. For more see a note written by @dalegre on our https://t.co/722YfqwaCB official blog. — Yuga Labs (@yugalabs) October 6, 2023 Yuga Labs is best known for creating the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT collection, which has become one of the most valuable and prominent NFT projects. Following the success of BAYC, the company released a number of additional NFT collections, like Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) and Bored Ape Kennel Club (BAKC). In March 2022, Yuga Labs raised $450 million in funding led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), to develop “Otherside,” a gamified metaverse that will integrate its various NFT collections. However, BAYC’s luster began to fade following the crypto downturn in 2022-2023. The prices faltered, and some celebrity backers sold their NFTs. According to data from NFT Price Floor, the floor price of one of these blue-chip NFTs dipped below 11 Ether earlier this month, reflecting an over 90% drop from the collection’s peak nearly two years ago.

410::https://theconversation.com/three-things-that-will-shape-the-economy-in-2018-89469::The Conversation::article::Three things that will shape the economy in 2018::Brexit, bots and jobs and bitcoin are set to dominate economics news in 2018.::Whether you follow opinion polls, experts, the media, or soothsayers, a few common themes have emerged regarding the economy in 2018 and beyond. These are Brexit, the rise of the robots and a continued obsession with bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Here’s a primer on how to better understand these three stories that will dominate the news. Someone claimed to have asked their iPhone: “Siri, what’s a good metaphor for Brexit?” Siri replied with the news story of someone trying to kill a spider with a blowtorch, and burning his house down. It nicely captures Britain’s approach to the EU. Few would deny there are problems with the EU; some of which may be as annoying as having an unwanted spider in one’s house. But there are different ways of approaching these issues, some of which may prove more drastic and costly than others. While moving the European Parliament between Brussels and Strasbourg may be a costly waste of resources, and the euro project never made economic sense, it is quite another thing for a country to voluntarily give up access to its key export markets – as was recently made clear by the founder of Cobra beer, Lord Bilimoria. Even if the UK negotiates a favourable trade deal in 2018, what the impact will be on UK industry is unknown and unknowable. Hence the importance of developing an effective industrial strategy, to maximise the chance of UK industry being able to continue to sell to Europe, even if faced with tariff and other restrictions. It’s important for industries to compete on the basis of high quality and innovation. Such industrial success will also be key for finding new markets, which may prove vital if European ones are blocked. The industrial strategy looks good as far as it goes, in identifying potential growth areas, and setting out the sort of investments which will be required to stay at the forefront of new product and process developments. But it’s hard to get too excited when a number of its predecessors sunk without trace. A big reason is that for over a century British industry has been locked in a trap of “short-termism”, with managers focusing on the next quarter’s share price and dividend payout, for fear that if these dip their company may be prey to takeover. And behind this industrial weakness lies the dominance of finance and the City of London, which has always been more interested in global deal-making than domestic investment. The unveiling of the latest industrial strategy left many asking who is responsible for monitoring its performance and ensuring its success? It is unlikely to succeed unless such a commitment is made – along with delivering long-term industrial investment; greater corporate diversity; a revolution in Britain’s education, training, and skills base; the creation and implementation of regional policy; tackling inequality of income, wealth, and opportunity; boosting Research and Development and innovation; and ensuring environmental sustainability. While the industrial strategy has focused on new technology sectors such as robotics, these have also been depicted as threatening to wipe out swathes of jobs over the next ten years. That may be, but we need to recall that the same was said by the Luddites 200 years ago – and many times since. There are two crucial aspects to why technology will not render us all jobless. First, although new technology replaces some jobs, it creates others. And given that technological innovation usually helps promote economic growth, the outcome has generally been more jobs rather than fewer. Second, if the number of jobs – or rather, the total amount of employment – were to decline, this should be a good thing, as the work could be shared out. This would give more time for leisure, with less intensive, stressful work. That has long been the promise, though rarely the reality. To reduce employment (either the number of jobs, or the amount each of us had to do, if a reduced amount of employment enabled greater leisure time for all) means increasing the amount produced per person (or per person hour). In other words, higher productivity. This is not occurring in Britain. Indeed, over the past ten years the UK has witnessed the exact opposite, with the rate of productivity growth declining rather than increasing. So, don’t plan for your three-day week just yet. Much of the above – stagnant productivity growth, the need for an industrial strategy, even the vote for Brexit – might be laid at the door of the 2007-08 global financial crisis and the subsequent global recession in 2009 – the first time the world’s output and income had fallen since the 1930s. Another thing to be wary of into 2018 is the fact that the danger of a repeat performance of this crash remains. International governments prevented the global recession slipping into a 1930s-style global depression by boosting government spending. But as soon as the immediate danger had passed the UK government – and several others – reverted to type, imposing austerity policies that held back the already fragile recovery. So, another shock to the global system could create a further financial crisis and recession. Last time the trigger was home-loan defaults; what might trigger the next one? Defaults on the growing car-loan debts? International conflict and even war? Or perhaps the bursting of the bitcoin bubble? Blockchain technology will be used increasingly for a range of activities – from the accreditation of global online learning to the creation of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, which are basically IOUs in digital form. So the answer to the question whether the bitcoin bubble will burst, or whether bitcoin becomes mainstream, is “both”. Cryptocurrencies will replace some of what current banking and monetary systems do. But the extent may be limited by concerns over their use for illegal activities, their heavy resource use in an era when we need to be making less use of energy, and their susceptibility to speculative bubbles and crashes, which always carries the threat of more general crises and recessions.

The firm has about 650 staff members listed on LinkedIn, including executives, meaning 23% of the company was affected. The layoffs come amid uncertainty for the company as it faces possible insolvency. In June it paused withdrawals citing “extreme market conditions” and has since hired restructuring specialists. The company said it is exploring options to “preserve and protect assets” following its mid-June turmoil. Goldman Sachs (GS) is said to be leading a $2 billion raise from investors to purchase Celsius’s distressed assets. Crypto exchange FTX, however, is said to have passed on a deal to purchase the lender after examining its finances. Celsius joins a growing of crypto firms letting go of staff amid bearish market conditions. Coinbase (COIN) laid off over 1,100 employees in June, with exchanges Bybit, Huobi, Banxa and several others letting go of staff in the past month. Prices of Celsius’s CEL tokens were up 15% in the past 24 hours, CoinGecko data show.

Key levels to watch this week::XRP was on the verge of breaking out of a bullish pattern that could result in a 40% rally soon.::XRP was on the verge of breaking out of a bullish pattern that could result in a 40% rally soon.  As the market condition turned bullish, Ripple [XRP] took advantage of it and pushed its price up. In fact, the token’s price had reached a critical level, and a breakout above could result in a massive bull rally in the coming days. According to CoinMarketCap, XRP’s price has risen by more than 3% in the last seven days. In the last 24 hours, the token has witnessed a 1.5% rise in its value.  At the time of writing, the token was trading at $0.5231 with a market capitalization of over $28.9 billion. In the meantime, a bullish symmetrical triangle pattern formed on the token’s chart. Source: TradingView The pattern appeared in mid-April, and since then, the token’s price has consolidated inside it. Thanks to the recent price increase, the token’s price was moving towards the upper trendline of the pattern, hinting at a possible breakout. A successful breakout could result in a 40% rally, allowing XRP to reclaim its March high. But before it reaches that level, it must go above resistance zones at $0.55 and $0.6. AMBCrypto then analyzed Santiment’s data to find whether metrics supported the possibility of a breakout. As per our analysis, buying pressure on XRP was high as its exchange outflow spiked. Its Supply on Exchanges dropped, further proving that investors were buying. Source: Santiment Whale activity around the token was high, as evident from the rise in its whale transaction count. In fact, AMBCrypto reported earlier that whales accumulated XRP worth over $55 million. However, the derivatives market metrics looked pretty bearish on the token. For instance, Coinglass data revealed that XRP’s long/short ratio dropped in the last 24 hours. A decline in the metric suggests bearish sentiment in the market, where there is more interest in selling or shorting assets. Source: Coinglass AMBCrypto then analyzed XRP’s daily chart to better understand whether a bullish breakout is possible. We found that the token’s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) registered an uptick and was headed further away from the neural mark. The technical indicator MACD also displayed a bullish advantage in the market, indicating that the chances of XRP breaking out of the pattern were high. Read Ripple’s [XRP] Price Prediction 2024-25 However, a few of the other indicators told a different story. For instance, the Money Flow Index (MFI) chose to move southward. Additionally, the Bollinger Bands revealed that the token’s price was in a less volatile zone, suggesting that the possibility of an unprecedented bull rally was slim.

To learn more on how we evaluate each piece of content, please proceed to our verification methodology page Users looking for privacy-focused tokens have likely come across the Sam Altman-founded Worldcoin, a controversial iris-scanning crypto project launched in 2023. But what is Worldcoin, and how can you buy the native token, WLD? This guide demonstrates how to buy Worldcoin (WLD) and everything else you need to know. Our process for selecting the top platforms to purchase and store WLD was thorough and conducted over a period of six months. The criteria for selecting exchanges primarily considered availability, fees, features, and security. In the case of wallets, the criteria considered support of assets, reputation, wallet type, and safety. Exchanges Wallets To learn more about BeInCrypto’s Verification Methodology, please visit the link. If you’re looking to buy WLD, you must first choose a compatible platform. Here are five BeInCrypto recommended exchanges, all of which support Worldcoin. OKX is a global cryptocurrency exchange known for its extensive array of features that appeal to both novice and experienced traders. The platform provides access to various trading options, including spot and perpetual markets. Binance is the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. It offers an assortment of features, including derivatives trading (options and futures), trading bots, staking, mining, and more. Binance users can also enjoy lower trading fees when they hold the platform token, BNB. Gate.io is an exchange that offers a wide range of services. This includes a huge variety of cryptocurrencies, margin trading with various leverage options, and facilities for lending and borrowing. The platform is designed to serve a broad spectrum of users, from casual investors to seasoned traders. Coinbase is a beginner-friendly and intuitive brokerage and exchange. The platform offers a learn-to-earn program, which helps newcomers understand crypto investments through video classes and rewards. Additionally, the platform features crypto staking opportunities for earning yields. An easy-to-use, global crypto exchange, CoinEx stands out for its wide range of assets. The platform supports staking, futures, spot and margin trading and offers a range of “smart tools” for strategic trading. Notably, CoinEx does not require users to KYC before buying crypto, making it a solid option for users looking to buy WLD anonymously. While several platforms support WLD, we’ve used CoinEx for this demo. While the process may vary slightly depending on your chosen platform, the general steps will be the same. Here’s how you can buy WLD on CoinEx: 2. Add funds: Log into your account. If your account balance is empty, you must purchase a cryptocurrency you can swap for WLD. For this example, we will use USDT. 3. Search for WLD: Use the search bar at the top of the page to find WLD. Click on the correct option. 4. Swap your crypto: Once you have clicked “Worldcoin,” you will see the below interface. Input the amount of USDT you intend to swap for WLD. Double-check everything before clicking “Swap” to complete your purchase. If you plan to hold WLD, ensure you have a compatible crypto wallet to store your tokens safely. Worldcoin is a project that looks to solve the problem of proof of personhood. Proof of personhood is a mechanism that verifies a person is unique and human online. It’s an important part of establishing one’s digital identity. In a world with a lot of AI, knowing who is human matters more and more. Despite efforts to identify unique human users through CAPTCHA tests like clicking on fire hydrants, the challenge of proving personhood remains unresolved. This complicates online voting, financial activities, privacy, and security. Worldcoin accomplishes this in a decentralized way using zero-knowledge proofs, without the user revealing their real-world identity to prove they are a person. The Worldcoin Foundation is a non-profit organization started by Tools for Humanity. The non-profit supports the Worldcoin community and will continue to do so until it becomes self-sufficient. Sam Altman, Max Novendstern, and Alex Blania founded Tools for Humanity in 2019. Altman, a co-founder and CEO, also helped found OpenAI alongside Greg Brockman, Peter Thiel, and Elon Musk. Worldcoin is centered around World ID, a privacy-focused global identity network. Through World ID, users can verify their unique human status on any participating platform — this means no more clicking on traffic lights, cars, or buses. This method is Sybil resistant, supports fair airdrops, defends against bots on social media, and aids in the equitable distribution of scarce resources. Additionally, World ID could facilitate global democratic processes and innovative governance models, such as quadratic voting. It might also pave the way for an AI-funded universal basic income (UBI). UBI is a social welfare idea in which all people of a country or geographic area receive a regular, unconditional cash payout. However, Worldcoin (WLD) would replace cash in the Worldcoin UBI system. Worldcoin was launched amid much controversy in mid-2023. The project has faced strong criticism for its business model, which involves scanning people’s irises in exchange for cryptocurrency. Scanning and storing biometric data raises concerns about personal data security and access. Moreover, Worldcoin received an even stronger rebuke for collecting biometric data in underdeveloped nations. The project received its first half a million users from field testing in 24 countries, such as Ghana, Indonesia, Kenya, and Sudan. Some questioned the ethics of exchanging biometric data for cryptocurrency. This also raises concerns about exploiting those who might not fully understand the ramifications of surrendering their personal data. There are many ways to compare WLD to other cryptocurrencies. Here, we will compare Worldcoin to Bitcoin. There are many stark differences between BTC and WLD. For starters, WLD is an ERC-20 token, while BTC is a coin. This means that BTC has its own blockchain while WLD does not. Since WLD is an ERC-20 token, it can easily be stored in both hot wallets and cold wallets (such as MetaMask or Ledger). The Worldcoin token exists on both the Ethereum and Arbitrum blockchains. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is primarily a decentralized payment platform. This means that BTC holders can initiate transactions with each other without intermediaries. Worldcoin (WLD) is the incentive layer for onboarding users to its identity verification platform and other services. Lastly, Bitcoin has a market cap of over $1.2 trillion. This makes up 53.2% of the total cryptocurrency market cap, which is approximately $2.36 trillion as of April 26, 2024. WLD has a market cap of just under a billion dollars, sitting at $925 million. Within the Worldcoin ecosystem, there are four main primitives: World ID, Worldcoin, World App, and Worldchain. Here’s a quick look at each. World ID is a privacy-preserving proof of personhood, otherwise known as an anonymous ID. It uses zero-knowledge proofs to verify user identities online while protecting sensitive information. This is accomplished using a custom biometric device known as the Orb. The Orb is designed to be a long-term solution for AI-safe verification of personhood. World IDs are issued through the Worldcoin protocol. This protocol allows individuals to demonstrate their humanity to any verifier, including web2 applications. It maintains user privacy using zero-knowledge proofs. Some of the future plans include issuing other types of credentials on the Worldcoin protocol. World ID is intended to be “person-bound.” This means it can only be used by the individual to whom it was issued. It aims to be secure against fraud by unauthorized parties who might steal or acquire World ID credentials. Additionally, it is also possible for someone to recover a lost or stolen World ID. Worldcoin (WLD) is the token issued by the network. It aims to align participant incentives with the growth of the network by initiating network activity. This distribution is intended to bootstrap the development of useful applications on the network’s financial and identity infrastructure. The World App is the frontend for World ID and is available on Android and iOS. It assists users in completing verification through the Orb, manages their World ID credentials, and uses cryptographic protocols to share these credentials with third parties while preserving privacy. Designed to enable seamless access to global decentralized financial infrastructure, the app sets the groundwork for future integrations. Over time, it’s expected that many different crypto wallets will incorporate World ID. World Chain is described as a “blockchain for humans.” It prioritizes human users by offering them priority block space and a free gas allowance, making it easier for verified humans to start using the network. announcing world chain! while still early, 5m people have already verified with the orb, and over 10m accounts have been created. to continue accelerating, worldcoin will launch a blockchain that can eventually support every human. pic.twitter.com/HFag6ToaNt This blockchain will be open source, permissionless, and secured as a layer-2 solution on Ethereum, enhancing its scalability within the Optimism Superchain ecosystem. Its design encourages real-world applications by integrating World ID for Sybil resistance. The aim is for the community to govern World Chain. As a result, this setup will offer developers a platform to reach users with apps that focus on real-world utility. Once you have bought Worldcoin, you will need to find a secure wallet to store the token. Here’s a quick roundup of some of the top options in 2024. OKX Wallet is the proprietary wallet of the OKX platform. Users must keep in mind that OKX has a web extension and mobile app, the latter of which is custodial. The non-custodial wallet allows users to connect to DApps and import multiple token standards like ERC-20 or Solana SPL tokens. ImToken is a crypto wallet software company. It has a non-custodial hardware wallet and a mobile wallet that is available on iOS and Android. ImToken allows users to stake, browse, access DApps, and buy crypto all from one wallet. As the name implies, the Coinbase Wallet is the proprietary wallet of the Coinbase platform. It is separate from Coinbase Prime and allows users to self-custody their crypto, hold multiple coins and EVM-compatible tokens, and browse the internet or DApps. The Trust Wallet is an extensive web3 wallet that allows users to store, swap, and purchase crypto all in one place. Users can also access popular DApps directly from the wallet, which offers traders a level of safety. Math Wallet is a platform-agnostic wallet that allows users to hold crypto on more than one hundred blockchains on mobile, browser extension, and cloud. Users can also use the DApp browser to safely access decentralized applications via the app. Before investing in or using Worldcoin, there are a few things users should consider. Firstly, if you are interested in investing in Worldcoin, you should remain aware of its usage. Less than a year after its launch, the Worldcoin app reached over 4 million downloads. However, this momentum slowed as 2024 set in. As of late April 2024, there are more than over 5 million unique humans on Worldcoin. On the other hand, Worldcoin has close associations with OpenAI and Sam Altman — though it is not specifically an artificial intelligence project. Narratives dominate most of the popular sectors in crypto. Worldcoin’s proximity to Sam Altman and OpenAi may prove useful, with positive AI news often acting as a bullish signal for the price of WLD. Moreover, the project was seeded by several big-name venture capitalist firms. Some of these include a16z, Khosla Ventures, and Blockchain Capital. In its latest round of funding, Worldcoin raised $115 million, amounting to about $240 million in total from three funding rounds. Whether you should purchase Worldcoin depends on your strategy. If you are a long-term investor who believes in the vision of the Worldcoin ecosystem, consider that as of April 26, 2024, WLD is down from its all-time high but still up from year to date. Although it has dropped from its all-time high of about $10, the price of WLD has increased significantly since its launch. In other words, for long-term holders, WLD is trading at a significant discount. Whether it makes sense to buy Worldcoin entirely depends on your investment strategy. As stated previously, narratives rule crypto. Worldcoin’s success will depend on whether the project can gain real-world adoption or generate enough hype or controversy to draw the attention of speculators. As always, ensure to prioritize security when interacting with decentralized ecosystems. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Investors can purchase Worldcoin (WLD) on multiple exchanges. These include CoinEx, Binance, OKX, and others. You can also purchase WLD on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). To withdraw Worldcoin in the U.S., you must first find an exchange that supports WLD. Many exchanges do not support WLD in the U.S. You will likely have to purchase the asset on a DEX. Users can purchase Worldcoin on many exchanges. For example, Binance, OKX, and CoinEx support WLD. Users should keep jurisdictional restrictions in mind. To purchase Worldcoin in the U.S., you will most likely have to use a DEX. Many centralized exchanges do not offer WLD. DEXs on Ethereum and Arbitrum may provide a way for users to purchase WLD in the U.S. Yes, users can purchase Worldcoin on Binance. User should keep jurisdictional restrictions in mind. For example, many cryptocurrencies are not available on Binance U.S. When users complete an iris scan with the Worldcoin orb, they will receive free crypto. WLD is not free on CEXs or DEXs. To purchase WLD, you will need to create an account on a CEX or purchase crypto to trade for WLD. Users can earn Worldcoin by completing an iris scan at an official Worldcoin orb. Orbs are available in over 30 countries. To date, there are at least 2,000 orbs available for scanning.

414::https://blockworks.co/news/solana-depin-projects-with-real-world-utility::Blockworks::article::DePin projects have gained momentum on Solana blockchain::Decentralized Physical Infrastructure (DePIN) is utilizing blockchain technology to enable users to take ownership of their data.::Blockchain technology is being used to incentivize community building in the real world Akif CUBUK/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks Decentralized Physical Infrastructure (DePIN) is utilizing blockchain technology to enable users to take ownership of their data. Tokens incentivize users to provide services in the real world using physical infrastructure and systems. A popular example of a DePIN project today is Helium, a decentralized wireless network. According to Scott Sigel, the chief operating officer of the Helium Foundation, anybody can buy a helium-compatible gateway — which is similar to a traditional WiFi hotspot in everyday homes — and install it around their properties or in commercial spaces. Read more: Unlimited Helium Mobile cell plan goes nationwide for $20 a month Once installed, these hotspots will enable community members to access wireless coverage in their neighborhoods or general vicinity. Those who provide the hotspot themselves will also be rewarded with tokens that they can cash out. “The economics of building out an IoT network has been historically difficult, and a lot of centralized providers have gone bankrupt in the process,” Sigel said. Sigel explains that Helium started 10 years ago and quickly realized that it was extremely expensive, from a centralized point of view, to maintain the cost of real estate and install networks while building out its IoT network. “This is something that is the core to DePIN, which is how do you coordinate work in the physical world, and leverage a community to create physical infrastructure?” he said. In 2019, Helium launched its decentralized wireless network and quickly grew its coverage worldwide. According to the Helium Explorer, there are currently 392,090 hotspots around the world. Read more: Helium hotspots go live in bid to turn Miami network profitable Sigel notes that cellular users, regardless of which network they use, are at the mercy of large telecommunications companies who determine where coverage will be deployed. With Helium, individuals and small businesses have agency to resolve the issue. “My favorite example is — there’s a company in Portugal where Helium IoT coverage is very dense, and they were in talks with the city of Porto about doing early flood detection, the fact they were able to build businesses and provide a solution to the city, completely relying on the coverage that was built by the helium community and people in Porto, speaks to the success of the business running entirely on community hosted infrastructure,” Sigel said. Helium currently runs on the Solana blockchain, a decision Sigel noted was made due to the network’s performant nature, which could handle high throughput and the large developer ecosystem. Read more: Helium token holders approve switch to Solana blockchain “The speed performance of Solana, coupled with their principles around intuitive frontend, were just some of the things that overlapped and made sense for us. This is something that ran through a community vote,” he said. Apart from Helium, another DePIN project being built on Solana and is gaining interest is Hivemapper, which wants to reshape the mapping industry completely. According to Gabe Nelson, the head of operations and marketing at Hivemapper, the company’s founder and CEO, Ariel Seidman, had worked in the maps industry for over 20 years. During this time, a large problem that Seidman was hoping to resolve was to look into ways to create maps in a cost-effective, scalable way. The current process of mapping roads requires street view vehicles with sensors to drive around each and every street, which is both labor and capital-intensive, creating an enormous barrier to entry into the mapping market. “Crypto tokens were a way to align the incentives of a big community to build something collectively and bootstrap it to the scale that it needs to reach to compete with existing infrastructure incumbents,” Nelson said. “I’m not aware of any other financial system that would offer this kind of functionality.” According to the Hivemapper Explorer, there are currently over 130,000 contributors across 3,253 regions. Over 11,231,955 kilometers have been mapped, marking around 19% of the total globe so far.

On Aug. 18, Binance conveyed that they are contemplating legal measures against Checkout.com, their former payment collaborator. The root of the potential legal conflict lies in communications made by Checkout.com to Binance on Aug. 9 and Aug. 11. As per Forbes, Guillaume Pousaz, the head of Checkout.com, concluded their partnership with Binance, pointing to regulatory actions and concerns over compliance, Anti-Money Laundering, and sanctions. A Binance representative stated, “We don’t concur with Checkout’s reasons for ending the partnership, and we’re reviewing potential legal avenues.” They emphasized that transaction services continue to be accessible on their platform. Yet, this termination led Binance to halt Binance Connect, a regulated crypto transaction service, on Aug. 16. Initiated in March 2022, this service functioned as a bridge between traditional finance and crypto enterprises, supporting numerous fiat and crypto transactions. Forbes indicated that Binance was once Checkout.com’s prime client, overseeing around $2 billion in monthly transactions in 2021. Recently, Binance has faced challenges in banking collaborations, causing difficulties for its worldwide outlets. In June, its European banking ally, Paysafe Payment Solutions, ceased support. Meanwhile, in Australia, Binance was unexpectedly disconnected from the banking grid. In the U.S., Binance.US encountered challenges in securing banking allies, with past collaborators Silvergate and Signature Bank halting services earlier this year due to a banking upheaval. Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s chief, even pondered acquiring a bank in a recent conversation. Moreover, Binance’s legal and operational predicaments persist. On June 5, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit against both Binance and its chief, alleging securities law breaches and unlicensed securities offerings. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

416::https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-inflation-response-rally/::Crypto Briefing::article::Bitcoin rallies to $66,000 as inflation pressure eases::Bitcoin's rally aligns with historical patterns, suggesting a potential peak in late 2025. Bitcoin may have hit the bottom::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to $66,400 on Wednesday after the April Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed signs of easing inflation pressures, according to data from CoinGecko. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a decrease in the CPI to 3.4% year-over-year in April, down from 3.5% in March. Similarly, the core CPI, which omits food and energy prices, fell to 3.6% from the previous 3.8%. Both CPI figures matched market forecasts, with monthly increases of 0.3%. The reading provided some relief after earlier CPI reports suggested more persistent inflation, which dampened expectations for an early Federal Reserve interest rate cut. With inflation seemingly reversing course, investors are now pricing in a 75% probability of a rate cut in September, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Bitcoin surged past $63,000 briefly after inflation data was released. The flagship crypto has extended its rally over the past hours. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at around $65,900, up nearly 7% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko’s data. The overall crypto market cap also experienced growth, rising almost 6% to approximately $2.5 trillion. Major altcoins followed suit, with Ethereum (ETH) crossing the $3,000 threshold, up 4%, and Solana (SOL) breaking the $150 level with an 8% gain. Bitcoin (BTC) may have exited the post-halving “danger zone” – the three-week period following the Bitcoin halving event, said technical analyst Rekt Capital in his recent post. He suggests that Bitcoin has transitioned to the accumulation phase. If historical patterns hold, the next bull market peak could occur between mid-September and mid-October 2025, he noted. “Currently, Bitcoin is accelerating in this cycle by approximately 200 days now,” the analyst stated. “So the longer Bitcoin consolidates after the Halving, the better it will be for resynchronising this current cycle with the traditional Halving cycle.” Share this article The information on or accessed through this website is obtained from independent sources we believe to be accurate and reliable, but Decentral Media, Inc. makes no representation or warranty as to the timeliness, completeness, or accuracy of any information on or accessed through this website.

417::https://theconversation.com/beyond-bitcoin-how-blockchains-can-empower-communities-to-control-their-own-energy-supply-99411::The Conversation::article::Beyond Bitcoin: how blockchains can empower communities to control their own energy supply::Blockchains and AI could play a key role in the decentralised energy systems of the future.::As the cost of solar panels, wind generation and battery storage falls, individual households and consumers are increasingly generating their own electricity, becoming less reliant on the power grid. This has led to energy systems becoming increasingly decentralised, which helps shift market power from large utility companies to individual “prosumers” – consumers who produce their own electricity. These developments have encouraged a rapid rise in the number of community energy projects around the world, where households generate, store, and trade energy with each other. In Scotland alone, the main community energy advice group lists over 300 projects that it supports. Academics studying the UK’s energy future are increasingly interested in the potential of these community energy models, such as the Findhorn ecovillage in northeast Scotland, with its energy efficient homes, solar panel arrays and community-owned wind turbines. Such projects usually work by enabling exchanges of energy between producers and consumers inside a microgrid which serves the community, providing local energy resilience to future supply shocks. One house can buy excess renewable generation from a neighbour’s solar panels, or from a community wind turbine. Blockchains are best known as the technology behind cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, but are increasingly explored in community energy systems. Blockchains can act as a digital record for tracking energy and money transactions, without the need for a utility company to act as a trusted intermediary. Simply defined, blockchain is a shared log of transactions, copies of which are shared by multiple parties, forming a distributed ledger. These ledgers take the form of an expanding chain of interconnected blocks of information (hence the name “blockchain”). Each new block added contains a pointer and a cryptographic hash of the data from the previous block, forming a linked list. This assures that blockchains are tamper-proof, as no party can change the information in a previously written block without this change being detected by all parties. In an energy context, blockchains promise to enable “real electron trading”, where the energy bought can be traced to the specific generator, battery or storage unit it came from at the time it is consumed. This is different from a consumer simply purchasing energy from a “carbon-free” utility company, which sources their energy from a renewable generator such as an offshore wind farm. In practice, this is not as effective, because due to power network constraints, the demand during peak times can often only be met from a nearby conventional power station that burns fossil fuels. By contrast, a community energy scheme using blockchains enables the consumer to buy power directly from the solar panel of their neighbours or from local storage. It also provides the choice to specify what should happen if the neighbour’s solar panels cannot supply power when needed – for example, it could defer some of the loads until locally generated renewable energy becomes available again. This not only cuts carbon emissions but also keeps energy revenues in the community. One of the main ways in which blockchains can enable this process is through so-called smart contracts – peer-to-peer agreements to supply energy which consumers can make with energy producers. Once a contract has been agreed, an algorithm will automatically enforce the terms and regulate the exchange of energy and money, without the need for a central trusted authority. For instance, a user could specify from which neighbour’s solar panels they prefer to buy energy at any given time. If the smart meter of the energy-exporting neighbour is linked to the blockchain, it can automatically detect how much energy is generated or exported and record this information, along with the transfer of the corresponding amount of money. It can also record how many other parties the neighbour has made contracts with and prevent double counting. One key issue blockchain technology needs to overcome is its reputation for wastefulness, courtesy of its use in crypto-currency mining – a huge consumer of electricity. The Bitcoin network alone has been estimated to require as much energy as Ireland to run every year. This is because, in the absence of a central authority, establishing which party can write a new block on the chain is done through performing an energy intensive computation, through a mechanism called “Proof-of-Work”. In recent years, research attention has shifted to consensus mechanisms that are faster and more energy efficient, such as Proof of Stake or Proof of Authority. While blockchains are a promising technology, unlocking their potential for a truly decentralised energy system will require research from a variety of areas. We can imagine a future in which software enabled by blockchains and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can negotiate smart energy contracts on our behalf, but enabling this transition is something that cannot come quickly enough for communities and the climate.::2018-07-12T09:13:26Z::Bitcoin, Blockchain, Clean Energy Future, Energy, Renewable energy, Solar, smart contracts::David Flynn::Home::https://images.theconversation.com/files/226287/original/file-20180705-122247-1vnnt9r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C215%2C4964%2C2482&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
418::https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/02/14/how-the-halving-could-impact-bitcoin/::CoinDesk::article::How the ‘Halving’ Could Impact Bitcoin::Bitcoin halvings have generally been good for the network. But price increases have decreased over time, says Todd Groth, head of research at CoinDesk Indices.::The new entrants coming into Bitcoin via the recently launched ETF and prices bounce back up towards $50,000, it’s a good time to dig a bit into the Bitcoin halving, as we’re expected to go into another halving event in mid-April. The Bitcoin halving cycle refers to the recurring event that reduces the blockchain rewards paid in bitcoin and given to miners for validating transactions and creating new blocks on the blockchain. This reduction occurs approximately every four years, specifically when the number of total blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain reaches a certain threshold, currently set at 210,000 blocks. You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. The halving event aims to maintain the scarcity of Bitcoin by gradually decreasing the rate at which new Bitcoins are introduced into circulation. Ultimately, this process will result in a total of 21 million Bitcoins being mined, with no more Bitcoins being generated after the final halving event. Read more: What Is the Bitcoin Halving? The general consensus is that Bitcoin halving events are positive for the price of Bitcoin, and historically they have been. The event often generates optimism among crypto investors, leading to positive price action afterward. This positive price movement can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the reduction in the supply issuance rate emphasizes Bitcoin's scarcity, which can drive up demand and consequently increase its price. Additionally, the halving event brings attention to the crypto space, attracting new investors and contributing to increased trading activity. However, it's important to note that while the halving historically has led to price increases, the magnitude of these increases may diminish with each subsequent halvings. To look more closely into the effects Bitcoin halving periods have had on distribution of returns, we looked back from July 2010 to February 2024 utilizing the CoinDesk Indices Bitcoin XBX Price Index, and compare the distribution of weekly returns of each halving period as bitcoin increased in value from 0.1 to recent levels of 50k USD per BTC. (Source: CoinDesk Indices, Investing.com) July 2010 - October 2014 period utilizes BTCUSD pricing from Investing.com; Return outliers of 0.5% and 99.5% were removed for sake of distribution illustrative purposes. (Source: CoinDesk Indices, Investing.com) From the overlay of these distributions, and comparison of annual return and volatility, we can see that as the distribution of returns has narrowed as the bitcoin market has matured from a crypto enthusiast hobby to a real asset with institutional interest. This evolution can also be seen in the decrease in both returns and volatility over each subsequent halving, while Return per Volatility has held more constant after the first halving. This evolution suggests that investors should not expect similar performance gains in Bitcoin that were experienced when the market was in its early stages prior to 2012. One area of the market that is directly affected by the halving event is the Bitcoin miners, via an immediate halving of block rewards for new blocks. This reduction in mining rewards can impact miners' revenue and profitability, as miners could face increased competition and higher operational costs, potentially leading to consolidation within the mining sector. Smaller miners may struggle to remain profitable, while larger players with greater resources, cheaper sources of electricity and economies of scale may dominate the industry. Looking beyond the halving events, the future of Bitcoin mining will eventually transition to relying solely on transaction fees once all 21 million Bitcoins have been mined. This shift will occur approximately 31 years after Bitcoin's inception. Miners will need to adapt to this change towards relying solely on transaction fees, although this will be a gradual change from each halving. Innovations in the crypto space, such as additional protocols and tokens that coexist alongside Bitcoin (e.g. Ordinals), may provide opportunities for miners to diversify and optimize their mining operations to maintain revenue beyond Bitcoin block rewards. We’ve come a long way in the evolution of Bitcoin from a cypherpunk and cryptography enthusiast hobby to a digitally-scarce store of value with its own spot ETFs and regulated derivative markets. That said, through market cycles, and increases in market capitalization, the volatility of the asset has decreased. So we should taper our expectations when analyzing historical halving cycles, as Bitcoin holders today are very different from holders in 2010. Edited by Benjamin Schiller.

US Presidential candidate Donald Trump showed his support for cryptocurrency at a special event for Trump NFT holders held at his Mar a Lago resort in Florida. Trump voiced concerns about crypto companies leaving the US due to negative attitudes towards cryptocurrency. He emphasized the importance of allowing these companies to operate within the country if the US intends to embrace this digital currency trend. Additionally, Trump mentioned his openness to receiving campaign contributions in Bitcoin and other digital tokens. Analysts have suggested that the November US Presidential election could have positive implications for Bitcoin as more people are taking to crypto. In contrast, the former US President took aim at the chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Hammond, who serves as government relations director at the Blockchain Association, drew connections between the Mar a Lago gathering and a resolution passed by the US House denouncing SEC policies related to crypto banking. Amidst all the political and electoral scrutiny, the TRUMP tokens are doing exceptionally well in the crypto market. Active community involvement has had a major impact on the success of MAGA VP MVP. The token is currently on 4 chains including Solana, BNB and BASE chains and listed on 12 CEXs to engage a broader audience of crypto enthusiasts. Currently, MAGA VP has seen a 43% increase in its value in just 24 hours, standing at $0.21, as of 10th May. MVP is celebrated as the TRUMP Vice President meme token, first of its kind, that represents a front for the MAGA movement. The MVP token holds a central position within the MAGA TRUMP ecosystem, functioning as a symbol of community support and engagement. Backed by top TRUMP holders, MVP incentivizes active participation through its rewards mechanism, allocating 1% of the buy/sell tax towards TRUMP rewards for MVP holders. By simply connecting their wallet to the dApp, holders gain access to a transparent and efficient rewards system, where they are rewarded with TRUMP tokens based on their MVP holdings. This incentivizes long-term holding and active participation within the MVP and TRUMP ecosystems, creating a strong sense of community and loyalty among holders. MAGA VP (MVP) has also shown a massive performance boost since its inception garnering considerable support within the entire crypto community. Apart from its tokenomic framework, strategic alliances and a committed marketing team has made MVP a key player in the market. To know more about MAGA VP MVP, please visit the website.

420::https://blockworks.co/news/depressed-miner-stocks-bitcoin-halving::Blockworks::article::How the Bitcoin halving could impact ailing mining stocks::Miner stocks have historically underperformed bitcoin before the halving and outperformed the asset after the event, analysts note.::Miner stocks have historically underperformed bitcoin before the halving and outperformed the asset after the event, analysts note Volodymyr Krasyuk/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks Though most mining stocks have so far taken a dive this year, industry watchers expect investors to buy back into the strongest such companies after the Bitcoin halving dust settles. Some of the world’s largest public mining companies have watched their stock prices plummet in recent months. The stock of mining giant Marathon Digital is down roughly 33% so far this year. Shares of rivals Hut 8 and Riot Platforms are slightly worse off over that span, down about 35% and 46%, respectively. Core Scientific’s stock has dropped about 16% since coming out of bankruptcy in January. Las Vegas-based CleanSpark has been an anomaly, as its stock price has seen a 55% boost in 2024. These nearly across the board declines come as investors wait to see which miners will be best positioned after the halving given the upcoming reduced block rewards — from 6.25 BTC and 3.125 — and the impact of that on miner profitability. Read more: The Bitcoin halving is just weeks away — here’s how miners have prepared Bitcoin halving events, which occur every four years, often trigger “speculative bubbles” that peak about a year after each cycle, said StoneX Digital data scientist David Kroger. “Investors may have adjusted their expectations and positions based on historical market trends surrounding halving events, including significant price fluctuations and market sentiment shifts,” he added. Those allocating capital to the space have also had a new way to access BTC since Jan. 11, when the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first US spot bitcoin ETFs. “You now have a situation where there is an option to get commodity exposure as an institutional investor with the spot bitcoin ETF that mitigates the company risk that you take on when you invest in a bitcoin miner,” Sue Ennis, head of investor relations at Hut 8, said during a Tuesday X space. While demand for the US spot bitcoin ETFs has slowed recently, the fund category has brought in roughly $12.5 billion of net inflows in just over three months on the market. Miner stocks have previously underperformed bitcoin going into the halving and outperformed BTC after the event, said Compass Point Research & Trading analyst Joe Flynn. Read more: Why most bitcoin mining stocks are down amid a persistent crypto rally With spot bitcoin ETFs available, Flynn said miners appear to be trading based on the halving-fuelled hash price declines rather than the BTC exposure they provide. Hash price takes into account bitcoin price, network difficulty, block subsidy and transaction fees. Measuring how much a miner can expect to earn from a specific quantity of hash rate, the metric is positively correlated to BTC price and negatively linked to fluctuations in bitcoin mining difficulty. “Any bounce of hash price off the lows post-halving and we think the stocks react positively,” Flynn told Blockworks. “Based on past cycles, we would expect a period of consolidation of BTC prices before a resumption of an uptrend higher in the second half of 2024 and into 2025.” Miners holding hefty sums of bitcoin on their balance sheet are likely to benefit from any post-halving BTC price growth from a stock perspective, Flynn added. Marathon currently leads that category among miners, with 17,381 BTC BTC on its balance sheet as of March 31. Hut 8 and Riot Platforms held 9,102 BTC and 8,490, respectively, at that time. “But we think investors [will] start to look at fundamentals like EBITDA, [free cash flow] and operating leverage on low power costs post-halving,” he said. Executives said the public market appears to be struggling to put a proper value on mining companies. Ennis argued that the market is discounting Hut 8’s managed services and high-performance computing businesses, for example. As the market matures, she added, investors and institutions are likely to do more due diligence around the varying business models of different miners. “I do think we are going to see capital and interest come back to this asset class after the halving after the market can see sort of who still has their shirt on and what’s the upside,” Ennis said. Jeff Hancock, CEO of Coinpass, said he expects the mining stocks to behave similarly to bitcoin’s post-halving price action in previous cycles. “It could be some time before these mining stocks recover, unless these firms can reduce their energy and operational costs,” he said. “Some of them may have to wait out the storm until bitcoin prices rise if they don’t have any additional income streams.” Bitcoin’s price (BTC) was at about $63,800 at 12:30 pm ET Thursday — up 4% on the day but down nearly 10% from a week ago. The public miners could see more immediate share price gains if more bitcoin exchange-traded products are approved in areas such as Asia and the UK, Hancock argued. Read more: After crypto ETF movement in Hong Kong, other Asia regulators could act “These institutional spot instruments were already absorbing more bitcoin than was being mined pre-halving,” he told Blockworks. “Post-halving, we could experience an extreme supply shock returning bitcoin’s price to current or higher levels, while also increasing miners stock prices.” Galaxy analysts said in a February report that between 15% and 20% of the bitcoin network hash rate could come offline after the halving. Read more: Financial trouble for bitcoin miners: A look back, and ahead as the halving looms CleanSpark executive Chairman Matthew Schultz said during the Tuesday X space that access to capital — allowing companies to deploy the most efficient machine fleets — will be a real differentiator after the halving. On the balance sheet alone, Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms each have more than $1 billion in combined cash and BTC. CleanSpark had about $300 million in cash and 5,021 BTC (worth roughly $320 million) available at the end of March. Companies with big warchests are expected to acquire machines and companies from smaller, less capitalized . Stronghold Digital has seen its stock price dip 58% in 2024. The company, if deemed an attractive M&A target by an industry peer, would “consider” such a deal, CEO Greg Beard previously told Blockworks. Argo Blockchain, which has endured a similar share price drop to Stronghold, declined to comment on its post-halving M&A strategy. Read more: Buyers and sellers: How bitcoin miners are thinking about post-halving M&A As for miners with potential high upside, Flynn noted that Riot’s cash and BTC represent roughly 50% of the company’s market cap. Iris Energy and Bitfarms both intend to double their hash rate this year, he said, while infrastructure-minded Core Scientific and Terawulf are “mispriced.” The stock prices of Iris Energy and Bitfarms both stand about 30% below where they started the year. Terawulf has fared better, down about 7% year to date. Flynn added: “I like miners trading at the lowest multiples that have locked in next generation machines — which lowers hash costs — and have the ability to grow to offset initial halving impact.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

This significant fee reduction is a consistent trend, pointing towards enhanced network usability. Ethereum’s affordability is making it a preferred choice for users, which could uplift its market value. Recent data reveals a surge in on-chain Ethereum transactions, hitting a near-record 1,089,893 User Active Wallets (UAW). Santiment analysts suggest such on-chain activity spikes could signal potential price rebounds, reinforcing Ethereum’s market cap in upcoming months. While other cryptocurrencies face price fluctuations, Ethereum stays strong above $1,500. Analysts in June foresaw Ethereum’s potential to reach a historic $3,000 milestone, driven by its dwindling reserves on exchanges—now at a mere 12.6%. Grayscale has amplified this optimism, seeking approval for an Ethereum futures-focused ETF, resonating with the Securities Act of 1933. This move, mirroring past approvals for Bitcoin futures ETFs, underscores the increasing institutional appeal of Ethereum. Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s co-founder, is championing two core tenets: privacy and decentralization. He encourages transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, emphasizing user security and empowerment. Though Ethereum’s price recently dipped to $1,593—a 2.7% drop over a week—it remains a formidable player in the crypto space. The current Relative Strength Index (RSI) for Ethereum hints at a potential oversold situation, backed by strong support at $1,500, pointing towards a bright future. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

Starting May 20, 2024, buyers and sellers of NFTs will no longer benefit from the purchase protection program previously offered by PayPal, a change quietly implemented through an update to the company’s terms of service. According to the latest update, PayPal will no longer include transactions involving NFTs in its Seller Protection Program if the transaction amount exceeds $10,000. This policy shift particularly exposes sellers to significant financial losses, as PayPal will not cover any counterfeiting, refund, or fraud risks exceeding $10,000 in NFT sales. Additionally, PayPal notes that transactions of $10,000.00 or below will continue to be covered by PayPal’s Seller Protection Program unless it is claimed by the buyer to be an “unauthorized transaction,” and as long as all other eligibility requirements for the protection are met. The decision to roll back protection for NFT transactions follows an initial announcement on March 21, where PayPal indicated a move away from safeguarding certain NFT-related activities, a plan that has now been fully realized. Previously, PayPal’s protection for NFT transactions offered a degree of security for both buyers and sellers. For instance, if a buyer received an NFT that did not match the advertised description, they could claim a refund. Sellers were also protected from payment discrepancies and fraudulent refund claims. This change marks a significant shift in the company’s stance towards NFT transactions. PayPal’s move comes despite its ongoing engagement with the crypto sector. The company has filed numerous patents related to blockchain and NFTs. Recently, PayPal’s US branch introduced a new feature allowing international payments using the stablecoin PYUSD.

423::https://theconversation.com/a-bubble-we-dont-even-know-how-to-value-bitcoin-89017::The Conversation::article::A bubble? We don’t even know how to value Bitcoin::If Bitcoin is a bubble, it will be because its price rises are too great and can’t continue. If it isn’t, it will be because the Bitcoin market is still expanding. We just don’t know which one yet.::Bitcoin is a “speculative mania” according to the governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia. But it’s not so easy to say that Bitcoin is a bubble - we don’t know how to value it. Recent price rises (close to A$18,000 in the past three months) may be too great and can’t continue. But the Bitcoin market is only just maturing as an investment and as a currency, and so it may still have room to grow. A bubble is when the price of an asset diverges from its “fundamentals” - the aspects of an asset that investors use to value it. These could be the income that can be earned from a stock over time, a company’s cash flow, the state of a country’s economy, or even the rent from property. Read more: The Bitcoin bubble – how we know it will burst But Bitcoin does not pay out profits (like shares) or rent (like property), and is not attached a national economy (like fiat currencies). This is part of the reason why it is hard to tell what the underlying value of Bitcoin is or should be. In the search for fundamentals some have suggested we should look at the supply of Bitcoins in the market (which is regulated by the technology itself), the number of Bitcoin transactions through the market, or even the energy consumed by Bitcoin miners (the computers that validate transactions and are rewarded with Bitcoins). If we take a close look, we can see how the price of Bitcoin may be diverging from these fundamentals. For instance, it is becoming less profitable to be a miner, especially as the energy required increases. At some stage the cost may exceed the price of Bitcoin, making the network less worthwhile to both mine and invest. Bitcoin may be the best known cryptocurrency but it is also losing marketshare to other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum and Litecoin. Bitcoin currently accounts for 59.4% of the total global cryptocurrency market, but at the beginning of 2016 it was 91.3%. Many of these other cryptocurrencies have more functionality than Bitcoin (such as Ethereum’s ability to execute smart contracts), or are more efficient and use less energy (such as Litecoin). Read more: What happened to the price of Bitcoin? The truth behind big bubbles and crashes Government policy, such as taxation or the establishment of national digital currencies, may also make it riskier or less worthwhile to mine, transact or hold the cryptocurrency. China’s ban on Initial Coin Offerings earlier this year reduced the value of Bitcoin by 20% in 24 hours. Without these fundamentals the price of Bitcoin largely reflects speculation. And there is some evidence that people are simply buying and holding Bitcoin in the hope it will keep rising in value (also known as Greater Fool investing). Certainly, the cap on the total number (21 million) of Bitcoins that can exist, makes the currency inherently deflationary - the value of the currency relative to goods and services will keep increasing even without speculation and so there is a disincentive to spend it. Many big investors - including banks and hedge funds - have not yet entered into the market. The volatility and lack of regulation around Bitcoin are two reasons stopping these investors from jumping in. There are new financial products being developed, such as futures contracts, that may reduce the risk of holding Bitcoin and allow these institutional investors to get in. Read more: What economics has to say about housing bubbles But Bitcoin futures contracts - where people can place bets on the future price of stocks or markets - may also work against the price of Bitcoin. Just like gamblers place bets on horse races rather than buying a horse, investors may simply buy and sell the futures contracts rather than Bitcoin itself (some contracts are even settled in cash, rather than Bitcoin). All of this could lead to less actual Bitcoin changing hands, leading to less demand. Although the rush to invest is apparently encouraging some people to take out mortgages to buy Bitcoin, traditional banks won’t lend specifically for that purpose as the market is too volatile. But it’s not just on the finance side that the Bitcoin market is set to expand. More infrastructure to support Bitcoin in the broader economy is rolling out, which should spur demand. Bitcoin ATMs are being installed in many countries, including Australia. Bitcoin lending is emerging on peer-to-peer platforms, and new and more regulated marketplaces are being created. Many companies are accepting Bitcoin as payment. That means that even if the speculation dies down, Bitcoin can still be traded for some goods and services. And finally, although the fundamentals of Bitcoin are still up for debate, when it comes to transaction volume through the network there appears to be a lot of room for growth. Read more: Price hikes in Ether and Bitcoin aren't the signs of a bubble It’s good to remember that people have been calling Bitcoin a bubble for a long time, even when the price was just US$35 in 2013. In the end, this is uncharted territory. We don’t know how to value Bitcoin, or what will happen. Historical examples may or may not apply. What we do know is that the technology behind most cryptocurrencies is enabling new models of value transfer through secure global consensus networks, and that is causing excitement and nervousness. Investors should beware.::2017-12-13T19:07:40Z::Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, Currency, Price volatility::Alicia (Lucy) Cameron::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/198884/original/file-20171212-31706-1cz9fe9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=3%2C315%2C2041%2C1020&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

The customer spent $6,000 to purchase the asset. The report said Luke Brown lost $5,800 on the NFTs he bought and filed the case in the Southern District of New York on behalf of others who bought digital assets from the NFT project. The complaint alleged that the company promoted the NFTs, telling customers that buying the DGFamily NFTs would grant them access to various digital rewards, physical products and exclusive events. However, the delivery of the NFTs was late. The customer alleged that the NFTs came with outfits to wear in the metaverse, but the digital outfits that showed up 20 days behind schedule “could be used only in a metaverse platform with barely any users,” the report said. The digital outfits couldn’t be used for another 11 days after they were released because, the complaint alleges, Dolce & Gabbana had not got approval from the NFT marketplace UNXD ahead of time. Dolce & Gabbana and UNXD, also named as a defendant in the case, did not immediately respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment. Read More: Brands Will Save Crypto?

Bit2Me, the leading digital assets company in the Spanish-speaking market and registered with the Bank of Spain, has just closed an investment agreement with Cecabank aimed at boosting the growth of Bit2Me’s API offered to Spanish and international institutions, companies, banks, and financial entities. This new investment once again demonstrates that the traditional banking sector increasingly trusts players like Bit2Me, who operate in a regulated environment, providing security to their clients. Cecabank, known as the Iberian bank for banks, with 310 billion euros of assets under custody, is a leader in Securities Services, Payments and Treasury services in Iberia. With this investment, it joins the ones Bit2Me received in June 2023 from Investcorp, Telefónica Ventures, Stratminds, and Emurgo, as well as the capital injection provided by BBVA Spark at the beginning of 2024, showcasing the confidence generated by Bit2Me among large companies and banks for operating transparently, with a clear business model and roadmap, and having its fiscal headquarters in Spain. Chosen by the Global Banking & Finance Review as the Best Custodian Bank in Spain for seven consecutive years (2017 to 2023), Cecabank is dedicated to providing support to financial institutions and other corporations leveraging on its experience as a wholesale Spanish bank. Meanwhile, Bit2Me, with its developed API, offers direct access to the crypto ecosystem for banks, companies, and institutions quickly, easily, securely, and with Bit2Me’s guarantee. According to Leif Ferreira, CEO and co-founder of Bit2Me, “this investment, along with our previous partnerships, reflects the confidence that large companies and banks have in our transparent approach and our solid roadmap. With our API, we are facilitating secure and efficient access to the crypto ecosystem for banks, companies, and institutions, and this partnership with Cecabank will allow us to expand our offerings further and reach a broader audience.” In the opinion of Abel Peña, Chief Sales Officer at Bit2Me, “this new investment agreement with Cecabank marks a significant milestone for Bit2Me on our path towards expanding and enhancing our services already being used by dozens of financial and institutional clients. This investment not only demonstrates confidence in Bit2Me as a trusted partner but also underscores our determination to drive the adoption of digital assets in the corporate realm. We are ready to seize this opportunity and take our offering to the next level.” Pablo Casadio, investor and CFO at Bit2Me expressed that “This investment comes at a turning point for the sector, where trust is being placed in exchanges that operate transparently and with a clear tax headquarters, and will allow our activity to be boosted. This investment by a banking entity in a crypto company is proof that the adoption that will arrive in 2024 will be at all levels.” According to Aurora Cuadros, Head of Cecabank’s Securities Services activity and responsible for the entity’s digital asset initiatives “Cecabank is committed to serve institutional investors and financial entities interested to operate in the digital assets universe with the same standards of quality and excellence that we already deploy in the securities landscape. The alliance with Bit2Me means one more step on that path”. Bit2Me is a leading cryptocurrency company in Spain and is registered with the Bank of Spain as a provider of virtual currency services. Currently, it is strategically positioning itself as the world’s safest, easiest, and most comprehensive digital asset platform. It holds several cybersecurity certificates, including the ISO 27001 standard and the Compliance Excellence Award granted by the newspaper El Economista in 2023. It also has Level 1 of the CSA STAR Certification and keeps its customers’ money in an Electronic Money Entity, so they always have access to it whenever they wish, and Bit2Me cannot touch it, thus guaranteeing its integrity 100%.

426::https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-halving-grayscale-interview::Blockworks::article::Q&A: What to watch ahead of the Bitcoin halving ::Blockworks sat with Grayscale researcher Michael Zhao to discuss the possible outcomes and get tips on what investors should be watching.::Grayscale’s research team sheds light on what is different about this halving and how to prepare Artwork by Crystal Le Bitcoin’s next halving event, where the reward for miners is cut in half, is slated to come any day now. Historically, halving events have been followed by new all-time high prices for bitcoin, so traders are optimistic. But given bitcoin’s recent run, escalating geopolitical tensions, and an increasingly uncertain macroeconomic outlook, analysts say this time could be different. Blockworks sat down with Grayscale researcher Michael Zhao to discuss the possible outcomes and get tips on what investors should be watching. Keep reading for excerpts from Blockworks’ interview with Zhao. Blockworks: What does history tell us about halving cycles and pricing? Zhao: While there have only been three halvings in the past, there tends to be a price increase after the halving after a few months. Given there’s a sample size of only three previous events, it’s hard to say that the price increase is due to the halving. The halving itself is already known to all market participants, so something like a decrease in issuance that’s already well-known theoretically shouldn’t impact the market at all. Blockworks: What is different, if anything, about this halving? What impact will this have on pricing? Read more: Here’s what the current state of Bitcoin development looks like ahead of the halving Zhao: The halving means the Bitcoin protocol is working exactly as it was programmed to. I think the only difference between this halving and the last halving is the different market dynamics between one: ETF flows representing a counter to an even lower issuance [and] two: increased activity around ordinals and excitement surrounding Runes. ETF flows seem to be a pretty straightforward story that’s been covered extensively; reducing the inflation rate by halving brings down potential sell pressure. While 3.125 BTC per block might seem like a small number, assuming there are around 52000 BTC produced annually post halving, at a price of $70,000, that’s $3.6 billion of potential sell pressure that is reduced annually. It adds up. Ordinals and the Runes launch (Runes are essentially another standard for a fungible token on Bitcoin) will probably spike transaction fees on the day of the halving and will continue to see more and more interest from the crypto native crowd. I’m unsure if this will cause anything significant for price, but this activity will be beneficial for miners, who will see increased transaction fees. Blockworks: We’ve seen increased institutional and retail interest in recent years, especially with the launch of bitcoin ETFs. How are these investors thinking going into the halving? Read more: ETFs helped ‘legitimize’ bitcoin ahead of halving: Q&A Zhao: I think broadly that others think that price will increase post-halving, given what they’ve read or seen. I think they are probably right. I would caution them that they should study both the crypto and macro environments surrounding each of the previous halvings and understand how those factors might have had a larger impact on Bitcoin’s price, more so than the halving itself. Blockworks: The narrative around the halving seems to be price-positive, but are there potential downsides? Read more: Financial trouble for bitcoin miners: A look back, and ahead as the halving looms Zhao: It might be a stretch, but there seems to be a competition between the miners right now, where some players are trying to crowd out other players by increasing hash rate, selling bitcoin etc., making it less profitable to mine. While miners have become a smaller and smaller source of Bitcoin volume over time, the price of bitcoin could be impacted by this sort of internal competition amongst miners. However, I expect that this won’t be that big of a deal long-term. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. Subscribe to the Empire newsletter.

This proposal comes after Buterin expressed doubts about the long term viability of friendly laws in Hong Kong during the 2023 Web3 Transitions Summit in Singapore primarily due to Chinas ban on cryptocurrencies. The CEO of Animoca Brands countered the notion that Hong Kongs relationship with Beijing would undermine its stability. Siu emphasized that Hong Kong operates as a market and plays a crucial role in Chinas strategy concerning emerging technologies like web3. He also highlighted that contrary to belief Hong Kong has been globally recognized as one of the worlds most stable economies. On Johnny Ng, a policymaker from the region extended an invitation to Buterin and assured him of connecting with relevant local organizations. These invitations align with Hong Kongs initiatives to establish itself as a prominent crypto hub by implementing pro web3 policies. To further bolster the crypto ecosystem Hong Kong has implemented licensing procedures for both institutional crypto businesses. Additionally local banks have been encouraged to engage asset companies as clients. It is anticipated that a regulatory framework, for stablecoins will be announced by mid 2024. Despite creating a welcoming atmosphere the authorities in Hong Kong have established measures to address individuals and organizations in the cryptocurrency industry who do not comply with regulations. They have issued warnings regarding misleading statements made by companies and have also taken legal action, against those involved in fraudulent activities connected to an unregistered crypto exchange called JPEX. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

Share this article In an effort to streamline its product offerings, Binance has announced that it will cease support for trading and depositing Bitcoin (BTC) nonfungible tokens (NFTs), also known as Bitcoin Ordinals, on its NFT marketplace starting April 18, 2024. In a blog post dated April 4, Binance stated that the decision to wind down support for Bitcoin NFTs is part of its ongoing efforts to streamline its product strategy for offerings on the Binance NFT marketplace. Users are advised to withdraw their Bitcoin NFTs from the marketplace via the Bitcoin network before May 18, 2024, at 00:00 (UTC). Starting from April 18, 2024, at 06:00 (UTC), users will no longer be able to buy, deposit, bid on, or list NFTs on the Binance NFT Marketplace via the Bitcoin network. All impacted listing orders will be automatically canceled at the specified time. “Please note that Binance NFT Marketplace will not support any further airdrops, benefits, or utilities associated with Bitcoin NFTs after 2024-04-10,” the blog post stated. The announcement also addressed Runestone NFT users who meet the conditions for the Runestone airdrop. Binance NFT had distributed these NFTs to eligible users’ accounts before April 4, 2024, at 10:00 (UTC). Users are advised to withdraw these NFTs by April 10, 2024, at 10:00 (UTC) to ensure they still have the opportunity to receive any associated tokens, utilities, and benefits after that date. Binance will not be responsible for any losses incurred if users fail to withdraw their NFTs before the stated time frame, the exchange said. Bitcoin Ordinals, which allow for the inscription of digital content like art, text, music, or video directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain, have gained popularity since their introduction in late 2022. The protocol, created by Casey Rodarmor, enables unique digital arts to be directly embedded into Bitcoin transactions, similar to Ethereum’s NFTs. Binance’s decision to discontinue support for Bitcoin NFTs comes as a surprise to the community, as the exchange had only added support for these tokens in May 2023, promising more opportunities for collectors. The high volume of NFT transactions has occasionally clogged the Bitcoin network, increasing fees and slowing processing times as more transactions are validated on-chain. Recent data from Dune Analytics, the network has over 64 million inscriptions to date and has generated over $423 million in transaction fees. As Binance phases out support for Bitcoin NFTs, users are encouraged to take the necessary steps to withdraw their assets from the marketplace within the specified timeframes to avoid any potential losses.

The truth behind big bubbles and crashes::On this episode of Business Briefing we unpack great heights and crashing lows of a bubble and a crash.::When Katherine Hunt’s dad asked her whether or not he should invest in Bitcoin, alarm bells rang, first she thought “he’s a musician”. Hunt is a lecturer in accounting at the Griffith Business School, and as someone who knows the five stages of a bubble and crash, she was worried when it seemed everyone was thinking they needed to “get in on” Bitcoin. “The stock market is a manifestation of the psychology of everyone who is investing, so of course there is going to be these crazy stages,” Hunt says. There is a boom, as momentum behind a new stock or asset speeds up and the media starts to cover it, fuelling its price rise. Then the euphoria sets in, the value of the asset skyrockets and people start to make a profit. But looming around the corner is the panic. Investors feel the last phase of a crash far more than they do the elation of the price rising, Hunt says. Panic breeds more panic and the price falls. Hunt is seeing this pattern play out with the stocks of the more well known gig economy businesses like Airbnb and Uber. These businesses now enjoy the privilege of being the only, or one of a few of their kind, in the marketplace. But Hunt says this can’t last. “In an open market that’s not the case at all, there’s always going to be competition and these companies will fall. It’s just probably that they’ll fall in 30 or 40 years, not necessarily tomorrow,” she says. Of course this is all easier to see in hindsight. John Crosby, now a senior lecturer in finance at the University of Technology Sydney, was once working as an investment banker at Lloyds of London in 2007 when he noticed a news story on losses financial services company HSBC was reporting from its subprime mortgages. “I thought, that could be quite bad,” Crosby recalls. At the time volatility was low and it seemed like everything was going along fine. But Crosby overheard a coworker who looked after the banks’ various branches asking people to move any sums to deposit to London. “That wasn’t normal right? It was perfectly normal that you did business with anybody you wanted to, unless there was a real credit risk issue with the bank,” he says. Crosby realises now that his coworker knew other banks were carrying toxic debt that would eventually kick off the global financial crisis. When it came to 2008 the real problems became clear and it was more of a question of which bank would fall next, he says. “People were way too complacent before the crisis and then during the crisis it’s one of blind panic, thinking everyday things are going to get worse. Whereas in reality there was light at the end of the tunnel,” Crosby says. By then Crosby was working at financial services company UBS and thousands of people were being laid off. In 2009 the company decided to hire half of those employees back. The benefit of hindsight also shows what sort of speculation leads to market crashes. Before crashes were well understood, economists had to grapple with what they thought might be causing a crash. In the 19th century, economist William Stanley Jevons believed that sunspots (hyperactive radiation on the sun) could be the key to understanding crashes. “He was interested to find out that the cycle of sunspots was very similar…as the trade cycle back on earth,” says Simon Ville, a professor of economic and business history at the University of Wollongong. Of course this theory was later discredited, but there have been bubbles over some very ordinary assets in the past. Ville explains that tulips were at the centre of the first market bubble and crash in recorded history. Tulips became high fashion in the Netherlands, in the early 17th century, but because it took a while for these plants to grow it was very much like the future markets we see today in modern finance. “That inevitably creates a sense of uncertainty and a sense of speculation, ‘what are you actually buying? Will you get the full value of what you’re paying for?’,” Ville says. Of course people started paying more and more for tulips, until it took someone’s life savings to buy one bulb. Ultimately there was a point where euphoria turned to panic and the climate changed from optimism to pessimism. This is when the price crashed, and the bubble burst.::2017-12-06T19:20:57Z::Banking, Bitcoin, Finance, Financial crises, Global financial crisis, Infographic::Callum Halliday::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/197906/original/file-20171206-31063-1qihm3h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=7%2C890%2C2406%2C1201&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

The investment bank raised its Coinbase price target to $217 from $110. The stock was trading around $204 at publication time. Bank of America said it was upgrading the stock for a number of reasons, including the positive macro backdrop that has helped the cryptocurrency markets and trading volumes, analysts led by Mark McLaughlin wrote. The note also said the exchange's expense discipline and increased diversification should also help its earnings. However, the analysts noted that there are potential risks that could limit the the stock’s upside, including the exchange’s continued dependence on transaction revenue for profitability and the regulatory overhang linked to the ongoing lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The commercials come around the highly anticipated bitcoin halving — slated to occur on April 19 or 20 — when per-block mining rewards are set to drop from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. The Coinbase commercial, posted on X Monday, shows a spotlighted motorbike in a warehouse-type setting apparently used for pizza deliveries. “Over time, your money gets you less,” a voice states. “Does bitcoin?” The commercial shows how much pizza a person could have bought with one bitcoin in 2012, as one box appears on the back of the bike. A stack of boxes is added to show how much 1 BTC was worth in 2016. Read more: This Bitcoin halving will be different — the institutions are here By 2020, the flood of boxes knocks over the bike. Cardboard rains down further to quantify the 2024 value of a bitcoin in pizza terms. “Roughly every four years, the future supply of bitcoin is reduced,” the spot states. “So historically, you get more. Not less.” The ad is set to start airing Wednesday on TNT, ESPN and ABC during NBA playoff games, a Coinbase spokesperson told Blockworks. It will run through April 22. Grayscale Investments’ ad, published to YouTube on Monday, touts the company’s standing as the world’s largest crypto asset manager. The firm’s Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) holds roughly $20 billion in assets under management despite consistent net outflows in recent months. “Sometimes investing feels like you’re going at it alone, especially when it comes to adding crypto to your portfolio,” the ad states as a man tries to row a racing boat and hang a painting by himself. “But it doesn’t have to be that way.”  It ends with the tagline: “Crypto investing begins here.” In addition to appearing online, the Grayscale spot will air on CNBC, CNN, Golf Network, News Nation and NHL Network, a spokesperson told Blockworks — including during the NHL playoffs. The upcoming crypto commercials during popular sporting events come after companies in the segment opted not to advertise during the Super Bowl in February. Read more: Crypto players skip Super Bowl ads, plot other marketing opportunities Coinbase is not new to getting out its message during the NBA playoffs, launching a campaign focused on updating the financial system for last year’s postseason games. The crypto exchange was one of the crypto companies to advertise during the 2022 Super Bowl. It more recently ran a television spot in February featuring a sad Abraham Lincoln on a penny, and the tagline: “Money is happier when it’s digital.” Grayscale ads have appeared in various airports and train stations for years.

[…]::Ethereum, the technology behind the worlds second largest cryptocurrency by market value is constantly evolving to keep up with the fast paced changes in the blockchain industry. To stay ahead Ethereums developers have introduced a testnet called Holešky. At the core of Holeškys launch is its starting supply of 1.6 billion Holešky Testnet Ether (HETH). This substantial amount is distributed to validators on day one to kickstart the networks operations. Whats interesting is that this token quantity is ten times larger than what exists on the Ethereum network. Developer Tim Beiko explains that development networks often utilize a 10 billion supply to ensure there are resources for testing and developing new features. Before Holešky came into existence Goerli was Ethereums testnet for experimenting with new staking mechanisms, infrastructure upgrades and protocol innovations. In October concerns arose when developers expressed worries about the supply of Goerli ETH available, for testing purposes. The abundant HETH supply of Holešky aims to address this problem. Alongside introducing Holešky Ethereums team has been encouraging app developers to transition from Goerli to Sepolia. This shift will leave core developers on the older network. According to documentation Goerli is scheduled to be retired in January 2024 followed by a year of support before its closure. The arrival of Holešky at this moment in Ethereums evolution is significant. The platform is gearing up to introduce groundbreaking features like proto danksharding, danksharding and Verkle trees. These advancements aim to reduce transaction costs and make running a node cost effective. The Holešky testnet will play a role in extensively testing each innovative feature as part of Ethereums ongoing development. Ethereum remains devoted to progress. Has already witnessed significant improvements in scalability, security and functionality through previous updates like the Shanghai upgrade. Christine Kim, an Ethereum researcher highlights that the developer community is actively working on the set of enhancements with a focus on the blockchains execution layer (EL) and consensus layer (CL). Additionally Holešky is preparing for assessments concerning infrastructure and protocols while Ethereum simplifies the process for users to launch tokens on its blockchain. Developer Aram Mughalyan has showcased a breakthrough by demonstrating that it takes than a minute to create a new token on Ethereum using the OpenZeppelin Contract Wizard. This advancement expands innovation, within the ecosystem. According to data from CoinGecko, the value of Ethereum (ETH) is $1,628 showing a slight increase of 0.07% over the past week. The market capitalization of this cryptocurrency exceeds $195 billion. On September 11th the token experienced a dip to $1,530 before recovering to its value. The introduction of the Holešky testnet and the streamlining of launches demonstrate Ethereums commitment to leading in Web3 innovation. These advancements pave the way for an more user friendly Ethereum platform that holds great promise, for the future. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

434::https://cryptobriefing.com/opensea-erc-721c-programmable-earnings/::Crypto Briefing::article::OpenSea debuts ERC-721C standard for programmable creator earnings::ERC-721C standardizes token transfer conditions, such as royalties, across all channels.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article OpenSea has announced support for the ERC-721C token standard, a new token standard designed to address the issue of enforceable on-chain royalties for NFT creators. This new standard allows for “programmable earnings” for NFT creators, a solution which OpenSea saw as a response to the long-standing issue of NFT wash trading. Previously, without ERC-721C, users did not receive royalties when the commissions were programmed outside the initial markets, losing their rights over an NFT when it arrived at secondary markets. NFT royalties range between 2.5% and 10% per sale, at the discretion of the creator. To date, the top 10 NFT collections have earned over $345 million in royalties since their inception. OpenSea began working on the integration for ERC-721C with Limit Break, the blockchain gaming firm behind the standard’s development. Limit Break’s work on the standard enabled “enforceable” token transfer conditions, such as royalties, across all channels. The ERC-721C standard, developed by blockchain gaming company Limit Break in May 2022, standardizes token transfer conditions, such as royalties, across all channels. Prior to its introduction, traders could easily avoid paying royalties by transferring NFTs through self-custody wallets or other marketplaces that did not honor creators’ royalty requirements. Limit Break explains the transition to ERC-721C succinctly in a Medium blog post. “In the long-run, this allowed for the incentivization of zero-fee, royalty-optional trading with airdrops, effectively turning tokens intended to be non-fungible into proxies for fungible tokens,” in which case “traders were incentivized to farm tokens by wash-trading NFTs among their own wallets, which is bad for the NFT industry,” the blockchain gaming firm said. Limit Break also said that the new standard is backward-compatible with ERC-721, the base standard for non-fungible tokens. The March 13 Dencun upgrade on the Ethereum network made compatibility for ERC-721C on OpenSea possible, the NFT platform’s developers said. Creators who enforce their earnings using this standard will have their sales supported only on OpenSea and other marketplaces powered by LimitBreak’s Payment Processor. However, creators can still manually list their digital artwork on other marketplaces, with OpenSea matching the lowest royalties set by the creator on those platforms. The new feature is also compatible with OpenSea’s Seaport 1.6, which allows NFTs to be sold under certain conditions, such as changing metadata based on sale volume. To implement the ERC-721C standard, creators using OpenSea Studio can easily set and enforce their earnings percentage and recipient address in their collection settings. For those deploying custom smart contracts, the process involves upgrading their existing contract to be compatible with ERC-721C or ERC-1155-C and then configuring their earnings on OpenSea.

435::https://theconversation.com/bitcoin-is-a-highly-speculative-investment-why-caution-is-required-88440::The Conversation::article::Bitcoin is a highly speculative investment. Why caution is required::The astronomic rise of the price of bitcoin over the past 12 months raises fears that the cryptocurrency is set to crash which could see many people lose money.::With the price of a bitcoin reaching record highs of more than $10,000, more and more ordinary people consider investing in the cryptocurrency. The recent price surge, however, comes with tremendous risks. Investors should be prepared for the possibility that they could lose their entire investment. Bitcoin was launched in 2008 by an anonymous author under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto as a means of transacting among participants without the need for intermediaries. Since the beginning of this year, the price of bitcoin has increased by 1300% as more and more consumers flock to it hoping to profit off its increasing popularity and the associated increase in value. Cryptocurrencies are not currencies at all. As the Financial Times explains, bitcoin is a string of computer codes which means that new bitcons can be created – up to an agreed limit – by computers that gain the right to do so by solving complex puzzles. Transactions are recorded in a database called a blockchain. Bitcoin, like other assets like gold, doesn’t yield income. You have to sell it to realise any value. And, like gold and other currencies, it can be transferred peer-to-peer. Part of the nervousness about bitcoin is that, along with other cyptocurrencies, it challenges the traditional role of banks and central banks. In the classical world, banks act as intermediaries by providing loans out of the deposits they took and from funding from the central bank. The central bank uses the rate at which it provides this funding as a lever to ensure price stability. The introduction of cryptocurrencies threatens this model because banks are no longer necessary to intermediate funds and there is no central bank to ensure that prices are stable. The more immediate fears about bitcoin centre on the recent dramatic rise in its value. There’s nervousness in the market that a flash crash might be imminent after the cryptocurrency tumble by more than $1,300 in minutes on the bitcoin exchange Bitfinex. It did recover to levels above $10,800. The flash crash echoes long standing warnings that the bitcoin party is set to end in tears. Most recently Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, one of the world’s largest investment banks declared that he would fire any employee trading bitcoin for being stupid. In a highly unusual alliance, his words were echoed by economics Nobel Laureate Joseph Stiglitz, who has gone even further arguing that bitcoin: All of these are clear warning signs that the professionals do not trust the lofty promises of crypto enthusiasts. There is no doubt that Bitcoin – and in particular blockchain, the technology behind it – has the potential to revolutionise the financial services industry. A blockchain functions as a transparent and incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions, recorded in chronological order, that operates on a peer-to-peer network. Fundamentally, the technology allows exchange of value to occur in an environment of peers with conflicting interests without the need for trusted intermediaries. That, in effect, wipes out the need for banks or financial services companies which fulfil this role. The use of the technology is not limited to financial transactions. Virtually anything of value can be traded on a blockchain. But no matter how useful the underlying blockchain technology is, or how widely it can be applied, there are real and substantial risks involved in bitcoin. The first, and most significant risk is that compared to any currency, share, or gold, bitcoin is extremely volatile. The volatility of bitcoin to US dollar is almost six times the volatility of the Rand to US dollar. While this is great in good times, it is potentially devastating for investors in bad times. When professional investors decide on which assets to hold, they look at both the return and the volatility of the asset. Only investors with a healthy appetite for risk are willing to invest in risky, volatile assets. Usually these are finance professionals, for example in large investment banks or hedge funds. Investors with a lower risk appetite, such as asset managers or pension funds, prefer assets with a somewhat lower return, but which are less volatile. The rule of thumb is that the sophistication of an investor increases with the volatility of the asset she invests in. But with bitcoin this rule of thumb doesn’t hold true. More and more private investors have been flocking to bitcoin ‘exchanges’ that have sprung up all over the internet and that are aggressively advertised on social media. There is a huge risk that bitcoin is already overvalued. The practical use cases for bitcoin are limited. It doesn’t enable enough transactions to take place per second to be used as a replacement for a modern payment system. And it doesn’t offer any functionality other than pseudonymous transactions – transactions where the true identity of the counterparties is hidden. Bitcoin is favoured by pyramid schemes, including the infamous MMM pyramid scheme in Nigeria. In a recent article, the Financial Times called bitcoin itself a pyramid scheme, much to the dismay of crypto enthusiasts. (A pyramid scheme is usually an illegal operation in which participants pay to join and profit mainly from payments made by subsequent participants. If no new people come in, it collapses.) The third, and possibly biggest risk is regulatory. In September 2017, the Chinese government outlawed bitcoin exchanges in mainland China, sending the price of bitcoin tumbling. Despite the claim that bitcoin is a “global currency”, the reality is that 58% of all bitcoin mining happens in China. If at any point the Chinese government should decide to make Bitcoin mining illegal the price is likely to plunge into oblivion. Other countries have also voiced concern. The Russian Central Bank recently issued a warning to investors on the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies, citing concerns about a bubble. This suggests that there might be a concerted crackdown. Cryptocurrencies are banned in India as their use is a violation of foreign exchange rules. The Australian Reserve Bank has taken a different approach. It monitors the cryptocurrency market in a bid understand the underlying technology. The South African Reserve Bank has expressed its openness to blockchain technologies. But it has also highlighted potential risks to consumers. There are real risks that many consumers investing in cryptocurrency don’t fully understand. Advertisements promise that bitcoin can make you rich fast. And social media is alive with stories about friends of neighbours or distant cousins who have made a lot of money through bitcoin. Without a doubt, these cases are real, and those who invested early can reap large benefits. But this is true in every bubble – from the dotcom bubble to the tulip mania. It’s also true in every pyramid scheme. As always, investors should be extremely wary with any scheme that promises quick returns.::2017-12-05T12:04:56Z::Bitcoin, Blockchain, Bubbles, Central banks, China, Cryptocurrency, Dollar, India, Investment, JP Morgan, Joseph Stiglitz, Market, Russia, Trade, assets::Co-Pierre Georg::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/197762/original/file-20171205-22962-14ls1wu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

Other banking giants, among them JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and UBS, also disclosed holdings in the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds during the first quarter. It is important to note that these purchases don't necessarily represent the banks' views on the direction of bitcoin's price, but instead were likely either made on behalf of the banks' wealth management clients or necessary for market making and/or ETF authorized participant duties. Morgan Stanley opened up spot bitcoin ETF allocations to its clients shortly after their approval in January, though only on an unsolicited basis, meaning that the client had to propose the investment to the broker.

Storm Trade is the first decentralised derivatives trading platform on Telegram, built on the TON blockchain and allowing trading with leverage up to x50. Keeping up with the times and providing all the best technologies to its users, Storm is releasing a major update – TON-Margin, which will change the way you trade! Many perpetual platforms, including Storm Trade, typically trade in stablecoins. However, TON-Margin opens the door to trading using TON as collateral. This gives traders more flexibility, variety and the ability to profit from even small price changes. And of course it brings the TON blockchain closer to true mass-adoption. Since January 2024, 2 trading pairs to TON have been available on Storm Trade: TON/USD-CM and 1mNOT-F/TON, which showed great popularity among the exchange’s traders. Today, 10 trading pairs to TON are available on Storm Trade, and TON/USD-CM remains the most popular of them. TON-M provides new opportunities, combining both risks and benefits. The main advantages of futures with TON to provide are: The main disadvantage of futures with TON in collateral is the rapid reduction of collateral when volatility is high. The emergence of TON as collateral and the opening of new trading pairs is a great event for the entire TON ecosystem because it opens up almost limitless earning opportunities for holders, stakers and TON traders. TON-Margined futures are an excellent tool for increasing trading income, protecting against losses in a falling market and diversifying your trading strategies. Trading only TON, on the TON blockchain, and using TON as a commission payment, on par with listing Notcoin on major exchanges, makes TON fully ready for the wave of new users that should inevitably happen in the near future. Don’t forget about risk management, trade with an amount of funds that is convenient for you, learn new things and expand your trading experience with Storm Trade!

438::https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-halving-interview-bitgo-ceo::Blockworks::article::Despite bitcoin ETF approval, institutions are on the sidelines: BitGo CEO::BitGo CEO Mike Belshe sat with Blockworks ahead of the halving to discuss the overall market environment, bitcoin and the launch of the ETFs. ::BitGo CEO Mike Belshe shared his thoughts on the halving and bitcoin ETFs in an interview with Blockworks Artwork by Crystal Le The Bitcoin halving is looming, as the quadrennial event is expected to take place at the end of the week. The halving, which marks the fourth such event in bitcoin’s history, will knock rewards down to 3.125 BTC per block from 6.25. However, a lot has changed since the last time the rewards were halved in 2020 from the launch of the spot bitcoin ETFs to bitcoin notching new all-time highs just last month. BitGo CEO Mike Belshe sat down with Blockworks ahead of the halving to discuss the overall market environment, bitcoin and the launch of the ETFs. Read more: ETFs helped ‘legitimize’ bitcoin ahead of halving: Q&A Keep reading for excerpts from Blockworks’ interview with Belshe. Blockworks: How is BitGo approaching the space post-bitcoin ETFs? Mike Belshe: What we have found, as an industry, in the last year and a half to two and a half years, is that there’s a political thing going on that is influencing the interpretation of laws and regulations. And because of that, the traditional players are largely locked out. But all of a sudden, they’ve got the ETF vehicle, which has been approved. It’s the one shining light that they can definitely use without feeling like they’re putting their entire businesses at risk. It allows them to participate in Bitcoin, to provide access to their own clients for Bitcoin, and yet not necessarily have to take all of the exposures that they would have to take if they tried to do what BitGo does. So instead, they lean on BitGo to make that happen. Blockworks: You guys have direct exposure to ETFs, correct? Belshe: So we’re handling two of them so far. I think there are many more that you’ll be hearing about very soon. We provide all the regulatory compliance that [bitcoin ETF issuers] would need to expect. We’re regulated in three different states as a Trust Company. We’ve got South Dakota, New York and Wyoming now. And then, of course, we have money transmission licenses and other things that we do so we’re a very easy player for anybody that’s looking for that secure storage to work with. Blockworks: Can you give some insight into the conversations that you’re having with these institutions following the spot bitcoin ETF launches? Belshe: The business this year is just growing so fast. I actually think the institutions aren’t as much in as you would think. We have our existing institutional clients, and they’re all going to retail on their own — and that retail demand has been growing. Some people are asking, ‘Where is this ETF demand coming from?’ And I think it’s still mostly retail demand — that is, retail clients going through Schwab, through TD Ameritrade. They’re going through their brokers and just now getting access to this asset class, which previously was just too hard to touch. Read more: The 2024 halving could usher in a new era for Bitcoin Now they just log in and buy. This is actually very good news for the industry, because there’s an endless amount of institutional demand, which we know is coming. So institutions are not yet in, and I believe they are coming, but the ETF was only approved in January…it’s not enough time for those evaluations to have been completed yet, which is why most of what we see so far is retail coming in. There’s some amount of the small hedge funds that are now coming in some amount of RAs can come in because they can make faster decisions and move quickly. And I think there’s a lot of headroom here for more demand. Blockworks: We’ve heard similar things from Valkyrie, that some financial advisors, etc. are not quite ready to embrace the ETFs just yet, and that they need more time. Are you hearing similar rumblings? Belshe: Some just need to see how bitcoin ETFs play out. The [Securities and Exchange Commission] was initially a no. Now they approved the products, but it’s not like these guys were like, ‘Great, the [bitcoin ETFs] are ready to go.’ A lot of them were on the sidelines, and now — even with the ETFs being launched — they need to see how it all shakes out. Is it all going to go to BlackRock or to Fidelity, or heck, is Bitwise going to get some of this? Is it going to be really unstable? Is it going to get big really fast? Read more: This Bitcoin halving will be different — the institutions are here That’s all starting to shake out now. People are now looking at it and saying, ‘Yeah, this is a pretty robust ecosystem, the largest, fastest-growing ETF sector in the history of the market.’ Blockworks: Is this going to be a different halving than what we’ve seen before because of all the outside factors? Belshe: I don’t tend to think about it in the short term. But long term, what is it really? Well, we have a distribution schedule for how new bitcoin [is] issued out into the world. That was put in motion all the way back in 2009. It hasn’t changed. That, by the way, is the first monetary policy in the history of humans that has been static for 15 years straight. Humans can’t stop tinkering — the Fed changes things every quarter — and yet Bitcoin has managed to hold it steady by the exact same schedule that was put in place in 2009. It just shows the difference between what happens when you hand the rules over to the machines versus the emotions of people. Read more: Financial trouble for bitcoin miners: A look back, and ahead as the halving looms You could ask the question: Why does it work this way? And that gets more into how do you build a currency of value without just giving yourself all the tokens. There are other currencies out there, like XRP, where Ripple gives themselves all the money to begin with, and then they say, ‘Come buy my coin.’ Alright, maybe some people are gonna do that and they’ve been fairly successful. Ripple still holds a chunk of XRP to this day. But it’s a lot harder to trust that, because you’re so dependent on Ripple and good stewardship of XRP. And I’m not trying to say they haven’t been good stewards. I think they’ve been reasonably good. But with Bitcoin, they didn’t want that. So instead, Satoshi Nakamoto put together this thing. I think it builds trust, and this is going to be just another milestone in building trust. Bitcoin is the one asset that’s going to do exactly what it said it was going to do, and not falter from the original plan. This interview was edited for brevity and clarity.

When choosing a crypto exchange, there are several important factors to take into account, such as regulation, supported cryptocurrencies, and fees. Just like traditional online brokerages, cryptocurrency exchanges function in a similar manner by providing you with the necessary tools to trade and invest in digital currencies. Beyond offering a secure platform for buying and selling digital currencies and tokens, many crypto exchanges also provide additional features for crypto investments, such as staking, lending, and digital asset custody. This allows investors to explore various ways of managing and growing their cryptocurrency holdings. Binance stands out as the leader of top crypto exchanges in the cryptocurrency space, boasting the highest daily trading volume that often exceeds $10 billion in a single day. This substantial trading activity ensures ample liquidity, even for emerging cryptocurrencies with relatively small market capitalizations. Moreover, Binance offers the advantage of low trading fees, making it a preferred choice for many traders. While its low fees might be appealing, the platform has run into regulatory issues and is currently under investigation in the U.S. Binance offers various additional earning opportunities for its users, such as staking, dual investments, and liquidity farming, enabling them to grow your cryptocurrency holdings in different ways. When it comes to depositing funds, Binance is quite accommodating, accepting dozens of fiat currencies and providing plenty of payment methods. The platform also supports peer-to-peer payments, including Wise, Revolut, Skrill, and Neteller, making it convenient for users to transact. Additionally, Binance welcomes deposits in cryptocurrencies, allowing users to easily fund their accounts with their preferred digital assets. Work in USA.

I partnered w/ @NakamotosOnBTC @ScrillaVentura & @ordinalsbot to put new exclusive music on bitcoin. 10,000 supply, free mint & holders will have CC0 rights to the music What communities deserve WL?#nakapepes pic.twitter.com/nER3D5VeiM — Ghostface Killah (@GhostfaceKillah) March 18, 2024 The CC0 rights license allows holders to freely build upon, enhance, and reuse the works as they see fit. According to the announcement, the new Bitcoin Ordinals collection was made possible through Ghostface Killah’s collaboration with Rare Scrilla, NakaPepes, and Ordinals Bot, an Ordinals inscriptions platform. Bitcoin Ordinals are a relatively new concept in blockchain tech. Essentially, Ordinals are unique digital assets created by inscribing content, such as images or text, onto individual satoshis, the smallest denomination of Bitcoin. By assigning a serial number to each satoshi based on its mining order, known as an ordinal, the Ordinals protocol enables the creation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and other assets directly on the Bitcoin blockchain without the need for a secondary layer. However, there are technical differences between NFTs and Ordinals. While this innovation has sparked interest among some users, it has also raised concerns within the Bitcoin community about the potential impact on network congestion, transaction fees, and the inclusion of non-essential data like artwork and memes. Ordinals gained traction in 2023 when developer Casey Rodarmor minted the first one on the Bitcoin mainnet. Despite a brief lull in the crypto space, Ordinals recently made a comeback in weekly sales on March 4, outperforming even Ethereum (ETH), according to blockchain-based rankings on CryptoSlam. According to data from Ord.io, some 1,290 audio files have been inscribed to Bitcoin at the time of writing, making Ghostface Killah’s release a significant addition to the growing trend of musicians leveraging blockchain technology for content control and fan engagement. While platforms like Sound.xyz and Audius have been using blockchain-powered solutions to empower musicians, the use of Bitcoin Ordinals for exclusive music drops and fan perks is less common. Nonetheless, the technology has gained traction with big-name brands, as evidenced by the NFT marketplace SuperRare’s recent expansion into Bitcoin Ordinals and the release of their “No Brainers” collection. Ghostface Killah’s first foray into crypto dates back to 2017 when he attempted to launch his own cryptocurrency company, Cream Capital, through an initial coin offering (ICO) which targeted a $30 million raise. The name of this venture is a direct reference to C.R.E.A.M., a popular song by Wu-Tang Clan released in November 1993 by Loud Records for the group’s debut album, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers). The song’s title is a backronym for “Cash Rules Everything Around Me” and has received critical acclaim worldwide.

441::https://theconversation.com/cryptocurrencies-are-finally-going-mainstream-the-battle-is-on-to-bring-them-under-global-control-117112::The Conversation::article::Cryptocurrencies are finally going mainstream – the battle is on to bring them under global control::Blockchains and cryptocurrencies are being co-opted by the very system they were designed to overthrow.::The 21st-century revolutionaries who have dominated cryptocurrencies are having to move over. Mainstream financial institutions are adopting these assets and the blockchain technology that enables them, in what is perhaps the most profound development since the birth of cryptocurrencies through the launch of bitcoin a decade ago. JP Morgan Chase has been leading the way, having announced JPM Coin earlier this year, the first cryptocurrency issued by a big international bank. When trials begin in the coming months, each JPM Coin will be redeemable for one US dollar, protecting this cryptocurrency from the volatility characteristic of the likes of bitcoin. One of the main reasons for JP Morgan launching these coins is to offer large corporate clients a way of making international payments in real time. This could gradually replace the current global interbank funds transfer network known as SWIFT, whose wire transfer payments can sometimes take a whole business day to settle. A few weeks later, the IMF and World Bank jointly announced the launch of Learning Coin, a private blockchain and quasi-cryptocurrency designed to help them better understand the technology. Facebook, too, was reported to be interested in launching a cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, financial firm 20|30 became the first company to float on a mainstream regulated trading platform using blockchains, when it issued shares in the form of “equity tokens” similar to a cryptocurrency on the London Stock Exchange. It is all a far cry from the rationale for creating bitcoins and blockchains in the first place: to decentralise finance away from the dollar-dominated system of fiat currencies and to gradually render financial institutions obsolete. Yet this space remains attractive to those seeking to undermine US financial hegemony. Iran and Russia are both looking at launching state-backed cryptocurrencies, in response to US threats to disconnect them from the SWIFT payments system. This would enable these countries to join other blockchain-based payment networks, with the potential to steadily weaken the international payments system. Other threats to global finance from cryptocurrencies abound. Services making it easier to conceal their movement, such as cryptocurrency tumblers, are said to be enabling fraudulent activities. There is growing evidence that cryptocurrencies are financing terrorism; while they are supposedly also vulnerable to rogue states – the UN recently accused North Korea of stealing US$571m (£441m) from five cryptocurrency exchanges in Asia. When you combine these concerns with the steady shift of cryptocurrencies towards the mainstream, it makes many observers very nervous: cryptocurrencies still represent well below 1% of global trading, but they are growing fast. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which oversees international banking, recently warned that cryptocurrencies were a risk to global financial stability, and advised banks to look at their direct and indirect exposure and protect themselves. Cryptocurrency regulation remains a very grey area. These assets are traded on two types of platforms, known as centralised and decentralised exchanges. Centralised exchanges, such as Coinbase or Robinhood, are platforms for connecting buyers and sellers, which enable them to buy or sell digital currencies either for other digital currencies or fiat currencies. The platform takes a fee for each transaction, and the amount of regulation varies from country to country. On decentralised exchanges, such as Block DX, traders sell cryptocurrencies directly between one another. These comprise a much smaller proportion of trading, and tend to be unregulated. They are harder to control – not least because much of the activity occurs on the dark net. The Financial Actions Task Force (FATF), the global standard setter against financial crime, is working towards global regulation of cryptocurrences on centralised exchanges. It recently met with industry representatives from around the world as part of a consultation to finalise global standards. This will inform proposals for regulation due to be announced by the FATF in June. One major aspect is Regulatory Technology (RegTech), which refers to technology that makes it possible to identify cryptocurrency activities such as the identities of traders doing transactions on blockchains. It will be interesting to see what the FATF has to say next month about the adoption of a RegTech global standard, which many would argue is crucial to making cryptocurrencies more transparent. On many other regulatory issues, the world remains a patchwork. France, for example, is looking at banning cryptocurrencies known as privacy coins, which are designed to make it particularly difficult to trace their owners. Ireland has amended its Anti-Money Laundering Bill to include cryptocurrencies, while the UK is moving in a similar direction – going beyond the existing relevant EU regulations. Japan, seen as a world leader on crypto regulation, is introducing new rules capping the amount that traders can borrow from exchanges to trade cryptocurrencies. Mexico and Canada are also looking at regulating cryptocurrency exchanges. The US, meanwhile, recently issued a clarification of the status of cryptocurrencies issued through initial coin offerings. Germany is planning to regulate these, too. These moves are welcome but hardly sufficient in global terms. A single country can impose tough standards on its cryptocurrency exchanges, but when transactions involve another exchange located in another country with no regulation, there’s nothing the domestic authorities in the first country can do to track payments once they have been transferred. Equally, you don’t have to go too far to find holes in the system: the EU regulations on money laundering don’t cater for tumbler services, for instance. Bringing enough countries onboard to make a major difference is not going to be straightforward, particularly with so much acrimony between Russia, China and the West at present. For global regulation to be far-reaching, it would also need to include the entire system – including decentralised exchanges, but they appear to be too problematic to focus on at the moment. All the same, there is clearly a growing desire to take the wildness out of blockchains and cryptocurrencies. These technologies are only going to become more mainstream; and the greater their share of the global economy, the greater their threat to the system as a whole. At least as far as centralised exchanges are concerned, the days of cryptocurrencies ruled by romantic buccaneers and pirates are slowly coming to an end.::2019-05-16T12:06:55Z::Bitcoin, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, Facebook, JP Morgan Chase, SWIFT payment system::Iwa Salami::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/274363/original/file-20190514-60557-38cbgs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=46%2C278%2C1941%2C970&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

There have been murmurs of an airdrop since March last year when investors bridged over $8 million worth of tokens to zkSync in order to be eligible. Total value locked (TVL) since then has risen to $141 million, according to DefiLlama. "The upcoming release of v24 is the final planned protocol upgrade needed before handing over network governance to the community. The remaining missing pieces are expected to be in place by the end of June," zkSync wrote on X. ZkSync is a layer-2 network designed to scale Ethereum, providing cheaper transactions by performing computation and storing data off-chain; taxonomically speaking, it's classified as a sub-type of layer-2 known as a ZK rollup, which relies on zero-knowledge cryptography, seen as one of the most promising new technologies in blockchain. Transaction fees became significantly cheaper in following Ethereum's Dencun upgrade in March, which allowed layer-2 networks like zkSync to compress transactions before sending them in batches to the Ethereum mainnet. The planned issuance of a governance token comes after a series of airdrops over the past year with the likes of EigenLayer, Renzo, Ethena and Wormhole opting to rewards early adopters as opposed to traditional token sales. Matter Labs, the developers of zkSync, have raised a total of $458 million across several funding rounds from the likes of Blockchain Capital and Dragonfly Capital.

444::https://blockworks.co/news/empire-newsletter-start-to-bitcoin-halving-week::Blockworks::article::Empire Newsletter: Bitcoin wasn’t a hedge — this time::Crypto markets were largely the only ones open over a tense weekend, and they took a beating for it.::Crypto markets were largely the only ones open over a tense weekend, and they took a beating for it Elektronik-Zeit/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks Halving week is off to a tumultuous start. Cryptocurrencies whipsawed over the weekend on growing geopolitical concerns after Iran’s Saturday drone attack on Israel. Bitcoin (BTC) crashed to below $62,000 on Saturday evening, further extending the sell-off that began Friday when BTC dipped from $70,000 to $66,000 in a matter of hours. By early this morning, though, things had relatively stabilized. Bitcoin is currently down more than 2% over the past 24 hours, sitting at $64,500 as of 11 am ET. Ether (ETH) and Solana (SOL) had bounced harder. Earlier this morning, ETH had been up 7% on the day while SOL had gained 9%. Both have since retraced slightly. It is, of course, worth noting that when the threat of a wider regional war looms over a weekend, traders are limited as stock markets are closed. The rush to traditional financial havens — gold, namely, which rallied 17% — started Friday. Oil prices hit their highest level since October last week. Read more: Financial trouble for bitcoin miners: A look back, and ahead as the halving looms By this morning, oil prices were easing but gold was still rallying, with spot futures ticking up another 0.3%. Crypto-related stocks fell on Friday along with bitcoin. COIN shares closed last week almost 7% lower, but were trading 0.6% higher pre-market this morning. MicroStrategy similarly lost 5% Friday and was trending 0.6% lower before the open today. Looking ahead, aside from the halving, analysts have their eye on oil prices, which historically are a leading indicator for recession. The oil shocks of 1973, 1980 and 1990 all led to gas prices spiking +35%, and, in every case, the US economy also dipped into a recession. “If oil prices spike enough to get US gasoline to $5.40/gallon this summer, a recession later in the year is a genuine possibility,” Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, said. When oil and gas prices spiked during the second Gulf War in 2023, the jump was an exception to the recession rule, but at that point the Federal Reserve had already been in a rate-cut cycle for two years. Quite different from our current situation. Central bankers meet again in a little over two weeks, and expectations of a rate cut continue to dwindle. CME Group futures data shows only a 4.5% probability of a decrease. — Casey Wagner Crypto seems to have overreacted to Iran’s attack on Israel over the weekend, with large parts of the market dumping up to 20%. Stock markets weren’t dumping before the bell on Monday. Still, anything could happen, but it seems whatever crypto investors were worried about, equities folk haven’t minded too much. At times like this, it would be nice if bitcoin were truly uncorrelated with the stock market. One could buy bitcoin as the world teeters. A hedge against dystopia, as has long been the value prop for gold. But that’s not always the case — yet. There have been instances where bitcoin was indeed a useful hedge. Times when it ran opposite to benchmarks amid high geopolitical tension and market uncertainty. Bitcoin and ether rallied more than 50% as then-President Donald Trump ratcheted up his trade war with China in May 2019, with plans to boost tariffs on Chinese imported goods from 10% to 25%. The S&P 500 fell more than 2.2% across that time. Bitcoin spiked by 40% around the Jan. 6 Capitol riots in 2021, while the S&P fell. Ether and the wider crypto market pushed even higher than bitcoin. And while crypto initially sank alongside the S&P as Silicon Valley Bank went belly-up last March, bitcoin and ether went onto pump more than 20% as the US government swooped in to make depositors whole. The S&P meanwhile only really managed to pare back losses. Bitcoin even surged by more than a quarter in the immediate aftermath of the Oct. 7 Hamas’ attack on Israel. The S&P 500 dipped about 5%. At other times of stress, however, crypto has traded opposite of hedgers’ hopes. Bitcoin, ether and the rest of the digital asset market crashed alongside the S&P 500 when Jamal Khashoggi was assassinated in Saudi Arabia in October 2018. Bitcoin and ether tanked again, by almost 15%, as the Hong Kong protests ramped up in early June 2019, even as the S&P 500 held strong, although crypto would sometimes rally as demonstrations waged on throughout the year. Sometimes, crypto even trades just like everything else. When the US dramatically pulled out of Afghanistan in September 2021, bitcoin and ether shed more than 10% as the S&P slipped 6%. And then there’s bitcoin’s monstrous 50% collapse around the Covid-19 crashes in Q1 2020, which happened in unison with global markets. Despite all this, perhaps we’re headed for a time where bitcoin and crypto really do act like a safe-haven asset. Although, judging by the weekend action, we’re still a long way from that kind of certainty. — David Canellis Hong Kong may have just joined the European and American ranks, as it potentially allows some firms to launch spot bitcoin ETFs. The Securities and Futures Commission, Hong Kong’s regulator, also seemed to beat out the SEC in simultaneously approving some issuers to launch spot ether ETFs. Read more: Ether ETFs coming in May? Here’s why many are bearish In a statement, China Asset Management said it was partnering with OSL Digital Securities and BOCI Prudential. The asset manager “plans to issue ETF products that can invest in spot bitcoin and spot Ethereum,” a translated version of the company’s statement said. OSL, in a separate statement, confirmed the “approval in principle and launch of its inaugural spot bitcoin/ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong.” HashKey said it also received approval alongside Bosera International. The two plan to team up to “jointly promote the issuance of spot ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum, providing investors with a secure, compliant and convenient way to directly participate in these markets.” The news Monday, which was expected thanks to reports late last week, was enough to buoy both bitcoin and ether after a volatile weekend. Ether gained roughly 7%. This is Hong Kong’s moment to solidify itself as a major player in the crypto space. The Special Administrative Region has been plotting new regulations and attracting crypto firms for the past year. Outside of that, this could open a door for institutional demand in Asia. In the US, the launch of the spot bitcoin ETFs led to bitcoin hitting new all-time highs, and a slew of institutions and retail buying into the new ETFs as firms look to gain exposure for themselves and their clients. Specifically, the launch of the ether ETFs — if executed in Hong Kong before the US — could give the overall market an idea of what to expect if, or when depending on who you ask about the ETFs, are launched in the States. — Katherine Ross Could a crypto-backed candidate kick Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., out of office? An array of crypto execs are betting that attorney John Deaton could, according to Politico. Publicly available polling on Warren’s chances is scarce. A survey in March 2023 showed Warren with some vulnerabilities among Massachusetts’ famously prickly electorate — just 41% of survey-takers held a positive view, compared to 36% unfavorable. Another poll a couple of months later had Warren narrowly beating former Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito in a hypothetical matchup, plus a huge percentage — 30% — undecided on their votes. Read more: Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton launches bid against Elizabeth Warren I live two hours west of Boston. If weekend talk radio and the cat food aisle at Big Y is to be believed, there’s a constituency here ready to boot Democrats, both state and national, off their perch. Look at Republican Charlie Baker’s run as governor, and Mitt Romney’s too, the argument goes. Plus, Scott Brown proved in 2010 that a Republican can win a Senate race here — right? Call me skeptical. Warren was viewed as a weak candidate heading into the 2018 race, and she won by a hair over 60%. Brown won against a terrible candidate in 2010, and then lost to Warren a few years later. Plus, Massachusetts has a thing about GOP governors who prove willing to tack to the center. Deaton is an intriguing candidate. But as Politico notes, Deaton isn’t well-known here, and the fact that he just moved to Massachusetts will definitely be used against him. If Deaton wants to beat Warren, he’ll need to focus on what’s really got people here grumbling — housing unaffordability, infrastructure and the cost of food.

Our guide highlights the top 5 cryptocurrencies to invest in::Definitely, the crypto market is on a fast track, constantly revealing new crypto to invest in 2024. As we move into 2024, a wave of innovative and exciting projects emerges, making it a pivotal time for anyone looking to find the best cryptocurrency to invest in for long-term growth. Whether you’re deeply involved in the crypto scene or a newcomer curious about your options, one question stands out: which crypto to invest in today for promising returns? This guide spotlights the top 5 cryptocurrencies to invest in for 2024, carefully selected for potential investors. Bitcoin has established itself as the longest-standing cryptocurrency in existence. Its prominent position is easily understandable given its substantially higher price and market capitalization compared to other available crypto investment options. The widespread acceptance of bitcoin as a form of payment by numerous businesses further solidifies its appeal as a wise investment. Notably, major companies like Visa have integrated bitcoin transactions into their operations. Additionally, Stripe, in collaboration with OpenNode, now enables merchants to process transactions and convert payments into bitcoin, marking their re-entry into the cryptocurrency space after a significant hiatus. Furthermore, even larger banks have begun incorporating bitcoin transactions into their range of services, acknowledging its growing significance. Bitcoin’s price has skyrocketed as it’s become a household name. To illustrate this growth, let’s consider the price evolution. In May 2016, the cost of purchasing one Bitcoin was approximately $500. However, as of July 11, 2023, the price of a single Bitcoin stood at approximately $30,407. This remarkable increase signifies a staggering growth rate of 5,981%. Related: Price of Bitcoin: 6 main factors influence the BTC price Ripple XRP continues to maintain its dominant position in the cryptocurrency market, offering notable advantages in terms of banking interoperability. As one of the top five cryptocurrencies, Ripple’s blockchain infrastructure and its RippleNet payment network present a viable solution to address the challenges of slow and costly cross-border transactions. Ripple XRP is particularly appealing for beginners who wish to contribute to the transformation of these transactions. With an eye toward the future, XRP is well-positioned to revolutionize international payments, making it a prime cryptocurrency for investment, especially for those seeking to capitalize on the forthcoming disruption in the banking sector. Whether you’re a novice searching for the best cryptocurrency to purchase presently or an experienced investor in the crypto market, Ripple XRP holds considerable potential for long-term growth and stability. At the start of 2017, XRP was valued at $0.006. However, as of July 11, 2023, its price had soared to $0.47, representing an impressive increase of 7,800%.

Cardano is a blockchain platform that strives to offer an enhanced, sustainable, and interconnected ecosystem for the creation and operation of decentralized applications and the execution of smart contracts. It seeks to address the challenges of scalability, interoperability, and sustainability that have posed difficulties for other blockchain platforms. Cardano’s approach to development involves thorough research, which has garnered both a devoted community and critics. While this method may result in a slower pace compared to some other projects, it also holds the potential for greater resilience and robustness. Related: What is Cardano (Ada)? Is it a good investment in 2023? Ethereum is a decentralized network that empowers developers to create their own cryptocurrencies and deploy smart contracts by utilizing its platform. While Ethereum may lag behind Bitcoin in terms of value, it holds a prominent position ahead of its competitors. Despite being released later than some other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum has surpassed its initial market standing due to its distinctive technology. It has emerged as the most widely adopted blockchain network and currently stands as the second-largest cryptocurrency, positioned just behind Bitcoin. It has garnered popularity among programmers due to its vast potential for various applications, including the execution of self-executing smart contracts and the creation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Furthermore, Ethereum has witnessed extraordinary growth over time. From April 2016 to the end of July 2023, its price escalated significantly, surging from approximately $11 to around $1,868. This impressive increase amounts to a staggering growth rate of 16,885%. Cosmos (ATOM) is rapidly establishing itself as a prominent rival to Ethereum (ETH), the leading smart contract platform, by providing developers with the capability to create customizable and independent blockchains. The migration of projects to the Cosmos ecosystem gained significant attention in June 2022 when dYdX, a prominent futures contracts exchange built on Ethereum, announced its intention to develop a standalone blockchain on Cosmos. This move highlighted the growing trend of decentralized applications (dApps) seeking greater customizability and scalability by forming application chains or “app-chains” within the Cosmos network. Crypto industry experts anticipate that many more dApps will follow in the footsteps of dYdX, recognizing the benefits of the Cosmos platform and its potential for forming interconnected application chains.

446::https://cryptobriefing.com/gcr-dogwifhat-meme-auction/::Crypto Briefing::article::GiganticRebirth wins bid for original Dogwifhat meme at $4 million::WIF price jumps following GCR's high-profile acquisition.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article The original Dogwifhat meme, featuring a dog wearing a pink beanie hat, has been sold for 1,210.759 ETH, worth approximately $4 million at the time of writing. Prominent crypto trader Gigantic Rebirth (GCR) won the bid at an auction hosted by Foundation. The auction saw a fierce bidding war between GCR, using the alias “PleasrDAO,” and Memeland, a crypto project. GCR ultimately emerged victorious with a winning bid of 1,210.759 ETH after nearly an hour of intense competition. The original meme can be studied as an ERC-721 NFT (non-fungible token) through this Etherscan address. Cryptopathic, a pseudonymous crypto investor involved in setting up the auction, confirmed on social media platform X that GCR had submitted the winning bid. The auction was settled by Chris Biron, a designer at Foundation. “On November 17, 2018, Achi’s parents captured him in an endearing hat on camera. The photo of Achi wearing a small hat instantly took the internet by storm, and now it has captured the hearts of people around the globe as a meme called $wif,” Foundation said in its post about the auction. GCR’s involvement in the auction has significant implications for the crypto community, given their reputation as one of the top traders by realized profit on the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX in 2021-22. Known for their insightful market analysis and uncanny ability to predict market movements months in advance, GCR gained further acclaim by accurately timing the market top in 2022 and shorting 30 popular tokens they considered overvalued. Although GCR has maintained anonymity and ceased using X from at least April 2023, their influence continues to resonate within the crypto community, with their posts frequently cited and referenced across the platform. The news of GCR’s successful bid for the original Dogwifhat meme has had an immediate impact on the price of the associated meme coin, $WIF, which surged by 10% in the hour following the auction’s conclusion.

447::https://theconversation.com/how-cryptocurrency-scams-work-114706::The Conversation::article::How cryptocurrency scams work::Cryptocurrency fraudsters have swindled their victims out of hundreds of millions – even billions – of dollars. What do they do to earn people’s trust and then take their money?::Millions of cryptocurrency investors have been scammed out of massive sums of real money. In 2018, losses from cryptocurrency-related crimes amounted to US$1.7 billion. The criminals use both old-fashioned and new-technology tactics to swindle their marks in schemes based on digital currencies exchanged through online databases called blockchains. From researching blockchain, cryptocurrency and cybercrime, I can see that some cryptocurrency fraudsters rely on tried-and-true Ponzi schemes that use income from new participants to pay out returns to earlier investors. Others use highly automatized and sophisticated processes, including automated software that interacts with Telegram, an internet-based instant-messaging system popular among people interested in cryptocurrencies. Even when a cryptocurrency plan is legitimate, fraudsters can still manipulate its price in the marketplace. An even more basic question arises, though: How are unsuspecting investors attracted to cryptocurrency frauds in the first place? Some cryptocurrency fraudsters appeal to people’s greed, promising big returns. For example, an unknown group of entrepreneurs runs the scam bot iCenter, which is a Ponzi scheme for Bitcoin and Litecoin. It doesn’t provide information on investment strategies, but somehow promises investors 1.2% daily returns. The iCenter scheme operates through a group chat on Telegram. It starts with a small group of scammers who are in on the racket. They get a referral code that they share with others, in blogs and on social media, hoping to get them to join the chat. Once there, the newcomers see encouraging and exciting messages from the original scammers. Some newcomers decide to invest, at which point they are assigned an individual bitcoin wallet, into which they can deposit bitcoins. They agree to wait some period of time – 99 or 120 days – to receive a significant return. During that time, the newcomers often use social media to share their own referral codes with friends and contacts, bringing more people into the group chat and into the investment scheme. There’s no actual investment of the funds in any legitimate business. Instead, when new people join, the person who recruited them gets a percentage of the new funds, and the cycle continues, paying out to earlier participants from each round of newer investors. Some members work especially hard to bring in new funds, posting tutorial videos and pictures of themselves holding large amounts of money as enticements to join the scam. Some scammers go for straight-up deception. The founders of scam cryptocurrency OneCoin defrauded investors of $3.8 billion by convincing people their nonexistent cryptocurrency was real. Other scams are based on impressing potential victims with jargon or claims of specialized knowledge. The Global Trading scammers claimed they took advantage of price differences on various cryptocurrency exchanges to profit from what is called arbitrage – simply buying cheaply and selling at higher prices. Really they just took investors’ money. Global Trading used a bot on Telegram, too – investors could send a balance inquiry message and get a response with false information about how much was in their account, sometimes even seeing balances climb by 1% in an hour. With returns looking like that, who could blame people for sharing the scheme with their friends and family on social media? Once a scheme has started, it stays alive – at least for a while – through social media. One person gets taken in by the promise of big returns on cryptocurrency investments and spreads the word to friends and family members. Sometimes big names get involved. For instance, the kingpin behind GainBitcoin and other alleged scams in India convinced a number of Bollywood celebrities to promote his book, “Cryptocurrency for Beginners.” He even tried to make himself a bit of a celebrity, proclaiming himself a “cryptocurrency guru,” as he led efforts that cost investors between $769 million and $2 billion. Not all the celebrities know they’re involved. In one blog post, iCenter featured a video that purported to be an endorsement by Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, holding a sign featuring iCenter’s logo. Videos of Justin Timberlake and Christopher Walken were deceptively edited so they appeared to praise iCenter, too. Another popular scam technique is called an “initial coin offering.” A potentially legitimate investment opportunity, an initial coin offering essentially is a way for a startup cryptocurrency company to raise money from its future users: In exchange for sending active cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum, customers are promised a discount on the new cryptocoins. Many initial coin offerings have turned out to be scams, with organizers engaging in cunning plots, even renting fake offices and creating fancy-looking marketing materials. In 2017, a lot of hype and media coverage about cryptocurrencies fed a huge wave of initial coin offering fraud. In 2018, about 1,000 initial coin offering efforts collapsed, costing backers at least $100 million. Many of these projects had no original ideas – more than 15% of them had copied ideas from other cryptocurrency efforts, or even plagiarized supporting documentation. Investors looking for returns in a new technology sector are still interested in blockchains and cryptocurrencies – but should beware that they are complex systems that are new even to those who are selling them. Newcomers and relative experts alike have fallen prey to scams. In an environment like the current cryptocurrency market, potential investors should be very careful to research what they’re putting their money into and be sure to find out who is involved as well as what the actual plan is for making real money – without defrauding others.::2019-05-13T10:37:13Z::Bitcoin, Confidence scams, Cryptocurrency, Financial Fraud, Fraud, ICO, Litecoin, Online fraud, Online scams, Ponzi scheme, Pyramid scheme, Scam, Scams::Nir Kshetri::Home::https://images.theconversation.com/files/273690/original/file-20190509-183112-75zv1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C863%2C5178%2C2589&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

Trades facilitated by Paradigm will be submitted to Deribit for execution and clearing.::Crypto over-the-counter liquidity network Paradigm announced on Monday a block trading facility on leading derivatives exchange Deribit for options tied to prominent alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), MATIC, SOL, and XRP. “Clients can now execute block trades in Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL), and Ripple (XRP),” Paradigm said on X, adding that the linear options will offer payouts that "directly correlate with the price movements of the underlying asset.” Options are derivative contracts that give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset by a specific date (expiration date) at a predetermined price. A call option gives the right to buy, and a put option offers the right to sell. Block trades are privately negotiated futures, options, or combination trades exceeding certain volume thresholds. Participants typically use communication technologies like Paradigm to request quotes bilaterally and agree on the price, following which the trade is submitted to an exchange, in this case, Deribit, for execution and clearing. Block trades reduce slippage or costs associated with executing transactions and ensure a minimal impact on the going market price. Since its inception in 2016, Paradigm’s OTC network has been a preferred venue for institutional investors to take block trades. The platform has registered nearly $400 billion in volume to date and, as of May, accounts for 17% of the cumulative bitcoin and ether options activity on Deribit. Paradigm’s new offering has already found takers. On Monday, the platform announced the successful completion of an inaugural trade involving 500,000 units of MATIC call spreads between Singapore-based QCP Capital and Galaxy Digital. The trade involved MATIC call options at strikes 80 cents and 95 cents, expiring on May 31. Paradigm facilitated the trade, which was printed on Deribit. MATIC is the native cryptocurrency of the Polygon Network, used for staking and to pay gas fees. "We are thrilled to see Paradigm expand its block trading services to include linear altcoin options, starting with the pioneering transaction in MATIC options on our platform. This expansion not only broadens our mutual offering but also sets the stage for upcoming inaugural blocks in SOL and XRP," Luuk Strijers, chief executive officer at Deribit, said.

450::https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-is-not-scarce::Blockworks::article::If you still think bitcoin is scarce, you’re suffering from fiat brain::Bitcoin is not scarce and it’s not going to become so after the halving next week.::Bitcoin scarcity is a meme, with or without the halvings Kevin McGovern/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks Bitcoin is not scarce and it’s not going to become so after the halving next week. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. Yes, Satoshi Nakamoto coded Bitcoin with a supply limit of 21 million BTC. Bitcoin supply is finite. But that doesn’t make BTC, the currency, at all rare. We’re largely accustomed to this by now, but one of bitcoin’s most appealing features is that each coin is extremely divisible, up to eight decimal places, making 100 million satoshis (sats) per bitcoin. Dollars meanwhile only divide out to 100 physical cents, two decimal places, or at most, 1,000 mills to three decimal places. Read more: Why is 2140 the end of bitcoin inflation? Now extrapolate all those sats to the current circulating supply of bitcoin. 100 million sats in 19.68 million bitcoin makes 1.968 quadrillion sats. And sometime in 2140, when you and everyone you know will be floating about the great Bitcoin citadel in the sky, there will be 2.1 quadrillion sats. The base money supply of the US dollar is currently less than $5.9 trillion and the much broader M3 is under $20.8 trillion. A quadrillion has 15 zeros, a trillion has 12. If bitcoin is scarce, then so is the US dollar. For what it’s worth, Gizmodo tried to grasp just how large a quadrillion really is with a Sour Patch Kids thought experiment in 2013. It scaled 100 candies laid out in real life to a quadrillion virtual ones across New York City, and found a jelly cube of that size “covered most of Downtown Manhattan.” It’s true that only 21 million people can ever own one bitcoin each. Around 1 million addresses have at least 1 BTC right now, and that number is slowly growing, although it’s not knowable how many of those are owned by the same person, nor how many exchange accounts have million-dollar bitcoin balances. Read more: Here’s what the current state of Bitcoin development looks like ahead of the halving There are also 53 million Bitcoin addresses that have one satoshi or more. If the current supply were suddenly sent to those addresses, each would net more than 37 million sats ($25,500). With this in mind, bitcoin is not scarce. That’s the fiat brain talking — it automatically goes to the largest unit when considering bitcoin as a currency. Your fiat brain does the same with dollars, euros, leprechaun gold and tacos. The reality is that sats are just incredibly cheap right now, $0.00069 each, so few consider them. If every sat were worth the current price of a whole BTC, then an even distribution would give every human alive $16.7 billion BTC. Do the same with all addresses containing at least one sat and each would net $2.5 trillion. A few years back, there was a push to find a symbol to represent the satoshi but nobody could really agree. With scarcity on the fiat brains of everyone watching the Bitcoin halving next week — crypto’s own solar eclipse — what better time to revisit the idea of pricing BTC in sats, rather than whole coins.

452::https://cryptobriefing.com/major-nft-collections-register-a-drop-in-eth-floor-prices-30-days/::Crypto Briefing::article::Major NFT collections register a drop in ETH floor prices, but there’s a catch::NFT Price Floor co-founder explains that a common market dynamic, related to ETH’s price growth, has been in play over the last 30 days.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article The Ethereum (ETH) floor price of the five biggest non-fungible token (NFT) collections has slumped in the last 30 days, according to data aggregator NFT Price Floor. The NFTs from Bored Ape Yacht Club collection took the hardest hit, with a 26.6% pullback on ETH price. Pudgy Penguins, which dominated the traded volume within the Top 5 collections, fell 10.3% in the same period. Meanwhile, CryptoPunks was the most successful collection at holding ground in ETH, limiting the pullback to less than 7%. Autoglyphs and Chromie Squiggle, the remaining two of the five largest NFT collections by market cap, fell 8% and 9.5%, respectively. The losses in ETH-denominated price happened at the same time the traded volume of Ethereum-based NFT collections rose by over 50% in traded volume, reaching $660 million. Despite the fall in ETH value, the dollar-denominated price of all five collections went up. Nicolás Lallement, NFT Price Floor co-founder, explains that this is a common market dynamic. When it comes to NFT prices, investors usually debate the price of collections considered blue chips in ETH, and their correlation with the altcoin. “As some have suggested ‘1 ETH ≠ 1 ETH,’ meaning the investor decision process is the following: 1) Check the current ETH price of the NFT; 2) Check the current USD price of the NFT; 3) Check ETH/USD price history of the NFT; 4) Decide based on USD current price of the NFT,” says Lallement. Over the past 30 days, ETH surged 62.6%, fueled by Bitcoin’s price growth and by expectations over the approval of a spot ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US. Lallement highlights that the Dencun upgrade, which is set to happen on March 13th and promises to lower the gas fees for Ethereum layer-2 blockchains, is also playing an important role in ETH price jump. “That means if ETH goes higher in USD terms, NFTs go higher in USD terms too, and ETH-denominated prices will have to lower to reach equilibrium again. The NFT bull in ETH terms will have to wait, in my opinion. We are still in a speculative phase where most of the attention is on low-value Solana-based NFTs and Ordinals,” Lallement concludes.

453::https://theconversation.com/by-concealing-identities-cryptocurrencies-fuel-cybercrime-82282::The Conversation::article::By concealing identities, cryptocurrencies fuel cybercrime::As cryptocurrency systems improve, they will better protect criminals’ identities and even allow people to offer anonymous rewards for crimes they want committed.::When hackers hold their victims’ data for ransom, as happened in the WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware attacks that spread across the globe in mid-2017, a key to the criminals’ success is getting away with the money. That often means they use cryptocurrencies like bitcoin to collect payment, hoping to remain hidden behind a digital mask. The WannaCry hackers went a step farther, though. They converted their bitcoins into Monero, another e-currency designed to offer even stronger privacy. At the Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Contracts, we have explored the ways cryptocurrency systems protect users’ anonymity. Anonymity in cryptocurrencies is fueling crime by enabling criminals to evade identification by law enforcement. We believe that this problem will get worse as cryptocurrencies evolve stronger privacy protections and become more flexibly programmable. We also believe there’s no simple solution. All cryptocurrency systems work in roughly the same way. Groups of computers receive transaction information directly from users who want to send each other money. The computers order and permanently record these transactions in a public ledger so that anyone can read them. The public ledger also makes it possible to keep track of how much currency individual users own. Developers tweak the code in different cryptocurrency systems to add additional features, like fast transaction processing or improved anonymity. The first major cryptocurrency system, bitcoin, allows users to conceal their real names. But users’ transaction amounts and bitcoin account numbers (known as “addresses”) are visible to anyone – even people who don’t use bitcoin but know how to read the transaction ledger. This approach offers more privacy than credit cards and bank accounts, even against powerful entities like governments who might try to trace money obtained by criminals. Bitcoin’s privacy both attracts users – law-abiding and otherwise – and raises law enforcement agencies’ suspicions. It is true that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies create opportunities for tax evasion, ransomware and illicit marketplaces selling everything from narcotics to illegal arms. Some concerns, though, like the potential uses for terrorists, are probably overblown. When crimes happen that involve bitcoin, law enforcement and security experts can exploit the system’s privacy defects. They study illicit activity by analyzing chains of transactions. Sometimes they can trace criminals to systems where their true identities can be discovered. If this isn’t possible, they can often still obtain clues about criminals’ behavior. For example, analysis of the bitcoin transaction patterns of WannaCry quickly showed that victims would not automatically receive decryption keys for their ransom payments. To identify a payer, bitcoin requires that the payer send payment to a unique address. This address acts like a kind of transaction serial number. WannaCry victims were all told to pay into just three bitcoin addresses. Because payments were commingled in this way, investigators realized that the WannaCry perpetrators could not figure out which victims actually paid the ransom. Systems with stronger privacy have arisen to shield users – and criminals – from such scrutiny. One type, called “mixes,” such as CoinShuffle++ and TumbleBit, bundle transactions together, allowing bitcoin users to launder their money and achieve stronger anonymity. Distinct new cryptocurrencies have arisen that offer very strong privacy using powerful built-in mixes. These include Monero, Zcash and MimbleWimble. Their success has been limited so far. Technical problems are one reason, but mainly their technical complexity and limited software support makes them hard for people to use. Ransomware usually requests payment in bitcoin. It is simply easier for victims to buy bitcoins than more exotic cryptocurrencies that better conceal ransomware creators’ identities. Ransomware creators hope to get the best of both worlds – enabling easy payment for victims in bitcoins, but then converting ransom payments to currencies like Monero to obtain strong privacy. Someday, once privacy-hardened cryptocurrencies are easier to use, though, ransomware creators and other criminals will be able to bypass this two-step process. Cryptocurrencies are not limited to simple money transfers. Newer systems like Ethereum also include in the public ledger not just a record of which account sent money to whom, but small computer programs called “smart contracts.” Once entered into the ledger, these programs remain forever executable. They can store and send money in arbitrarily complex ways. Any user – or another smart contract – can trigger execution of a smart contract simply by sending it a transaction. When autonomous smart contracts are combined with anonymous cryptocurrency, they provide opportunities to handle money in complicated ways that hackers can exploit. Twice, money has been stolen from Ethereum contracts in heists that each involved more money than the largest bank robbery in the United States. The identities of the thieves remain unknown. In the future, “criminal smart contracts” may emerge. These might be programmed to make automatic payments when specific secrets are stolen, when particular websites are hacked and defaced, or even for physical crimes ranging from vandalism to terrorism. A person who wanted a particular crime to be committed could post a smart contract reward to be paid out to the criminal who actually does the deed. Someone seeking to claim the reward would, before committing the crime, add an encoded message to the smart contract containing specific details only the criminal would know beforehand – such as a unique phrase or long string of numbers to be posted on a hacked website. When the crime is committed, the person who did the deed would decode the added message, revealing the details that had been specified in advance. The smart contract could then check the actual details of the crime and, if they matched, pay out the reward. The anonymity of the underlying cryptocurrency would hide the criminal’s identity. Today, smart contracts cannot easily obtain trustworthy data from the internet about crimes like vandalism in a form that computer programs can easily understand. So criminal smart contracts have not yet come about. But advances in crime driven by smart contracts will eventually emerge, aided by continuing improvements in anonymity technologies. Anonymity isn’t all bad, of course. On the contrary, it’s a key ingredient of privacy-preserving systems, and necessary to prevent overreach and abuses by governments. Cryptocurrency cannot thrive without privacy protections. What’s hard is finding a socially responsible blend of privacy and accountability. Today, law enforcement authorities can exploit privacy weaknesses in systems like bitcoin to identify certain cryptocurrency as belonging to criminals and thus as “tainted.” They try to catch criminals when, for example, they convert tainted currency into ordinary currency like U.S. dollars or euros. This strategy will no longer work when stronger privacy technologies conceal tainted cryptocurrency. Scientists have for decades sought to design systems that balance law enforcement needs with individual privacy in digital currency. Most of these systems provide what is called “conditional anonymity,” allowing authorities to learn user identities selectively through a technical process that can involve courts or other overseers. Appealing as it sounds, this approach is unworkable. If one authority, say the U.S. federal court system, has the ability to strip users of anonymity, then all authorities will want it. Privacy will then be meaningless. Crime-fighting tools require empowerment of authorities. Cryptocurrencies are innately anti-authority technologies. How this tension is resolved will determine the future of the world’s monetary systems. There is no simple answer.::2017-09-26T00:17:32Z::Bitcoin, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, Cybercrime, Online anonymity, Ransomware, WannaCry::Ari Juels::Home::https://images.theconversation.com/files/186884/original/file-20170920-16382-1vgnjm0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
454::https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/14/bitcoin-market-activity-suggests-looming-us-inflation-data-may-be-non-event/::CoinDesk::article::Bitcoin Market Activity Suggests Looming U.S. Inflation Data May Be Non-Event::The way bitcoin options are priced suggests Wednesday's CPI report, though pivotal, may do little to disturb the calm in the crypto market. CPI to signal moderation::Tomorrow's U.S. inflation report will take center stage as investors look for guidance on the Federal Reserve's path for interest rates after a series of recent surprises dented expectations of rate cuts. Still, the pricing of bitcoin options – which can offer protection against swings in the asset's price – suggests traders do not foresee a volatility explosion following the release. Traders often buy options that capture specific events, pushing their implied volatility higher relative to shorter- and longer-term contracts. Analysts look at the difference between implied volatility for options expiring before and after an event to understand how much extra volatility the market is pricing. "The market is pricing a premium of only 1.5 vols for the event ... almost negligible," institutional liquidity provider OrBit Markets, one of the top altcoin market makers on Deribit, told CoinDesk. In other words, prices may move less than 2% on either side following the CPI report, exhibiting hardly any additional volatility. S&P 500 options are pricing in relatively higher volatility for the release, OrBit said. The U.S. Labor Department will publish the consumer price index (CPI) data for April 12:30 UTC. It is forecast to show the cost of living increased by 3.4% year-on-year, a moderation from March's 3.5%. Core CPI, which strips out the volatile food and energy component, probably rose 3.6% year-on-year, down from March's 3.8%, according to estimates published by Bloomberg. Options offer buyers insurance against bullish or bearish price moves. A call option protects against price rallies, while a put protects from price slides. Implied volatility refers to expectations for price turbulence over a specific period. Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, considered bitcoin options expiring later in the week. His analysis agrees with OrBit's. "Implied volatility at 52.8% for options expiring on May 17 is just 2% higher than other options, which means traders expect a moderate pick up in volatility post-CPI. However, realized [historical] volatility remains below 50%, meaning expectations for an outsized move either up or down are not priced in," Thielen told CoinDesk. Fed funds futures currently assign just a 5% probability of a rate cut in June, with the number rising notably into September. Some analysts expect a potential soft CPI print to bulk up the rate cut probability, sending bitcoin past $65,000, the upper end of the its recent trading range. Others are more cautious. Inflation, for example, is only one of the inputs considered by policy makers. "Some signs of slower price growth (if materialized) would be welcomed by Fed officials, but the details of earlier price increases have been concerning. It will take more than one softer price report to calm inflation fears," economists at RBC said in a weekly note. "Our view is that inflation pressures will ease over the second half of this year, but that is contingent on economic growth slowing and unemployment edging higher. We expect the Fed will stick to a wait-and-see approach over the summer while watching the data closely. We think the Fed will move to cut interest rates in December if domestic demand and inflation readings gradually move lower over the remainder of this year." Edited by Sheldon Reback.

Rated monitors node and node operator performance and risk on Proof of Stake networks, where node operators and validators steward billions in value. Rated is pleased to introduce the Solana Network Explorer, offering a detailed, real-time overview of Solana’s network performance, allowing users to delve into the specifics of consensus data and validators that secure billions of dollars in value. A significant amount of blockchain and transactional value is being built natively on the internet, yet information about how they perform and the risks underlying them is fragmented. Block explorers are essential, yet the work carried out by network operators and the underlying blockchain infrastructure providers is often in the dark. Solana’s performance driven design is entirely reliant on the network of validators who make up the Solana Network. There are currently around 1767 validators securing the Solana with an active stake of approximately 58 Billion USD, across over 1 million active staking accounts. Questions often arise about the actual composition of the network, Who are the network operators and stakers ? What risks are they taking, and how do they perform? The Rated Solana Network Explorer and suite of API tools answers these questions by providing detailed insights into the present and historical state of the network, including operator performance, commissions, network penetration, vote effectiveness/latency, client, geo and host distribution, and more. In the blockchain realm, traditional metrics like uptime, latency, and APY only tell part of the story about a network’s health and the standing of the operators within it , Rated saw the need to develop RAVER, an open-source methodology aimed at measuring risk-adjusted performance more comprehensively. Reliable and up-to-date network state data forms a crucial foundation for sophisticated blockchains like Solana. Rated’s methodology not only sheds light on the specifics of the Solana’s network but also establishes a path forward towards enhanced transparency, accountability, and ongoing innovation. “The introduction of the Solana Explorer on Rated adds valuable context to the Solana validator network and is an important step in making it easy for users to monitor and understand the network’s core functioning.” “We’re really excited to be launching support for Solana. This release stands on the shoulders of innovations in wrangling with the myriad of data points that the network produces, which we think will add material value to the ecosystem.” To explore Solana’s network and operators, visit the Solana Rated Explorer Rated Labs is a pioneer in the Web3 infrastructure data space. Since its inception in 2022, the company has seen nearly 250k unique visitors on its network explorer, 15k MAUs, 500M calls on its API spread across 45+ integrations, as well as partnerships and integrations with leaders and innovators in the Staking ecosystem including Lido, Metamask, Liquid Collective, Chorus One, and more.

456::https://blockworks.co/news/spot-bitcoin-etf-flows-gbtc::Blockworks::article::Spot bitcoin ETF flows turn positive again as GBTC outflows taper::GBTC’s net outflows of $17.5 million on Wednesday mark the fund’s lowest in a single day since it converted to an ETF on Jan. 11.::GBTC’s net outflows of $17.5 million on Wednesday mark the fund’s lowest in a single day since it converted to an ETF on Jan. 11 Artwork by Crystal Le The assets leaving Grayscale Investment’s spot bitcoin ETF hit a new single day low, helping the broader fund category end a two-day net outflow streak. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) saw $17.5 million of net money leave its fund Wednesday, according to Farside Investors data. The total was a record low and reflected a substantial dip from net outflows of $303 million on Monday and $155 million on Tuesday. Helped by the shrunken GBTC outflow total Wednesday, the 11-fund US spot bitcoin ETF segment notched net inflows of $124 million. The BTC funds cumulatively endured net outflows of $224 million and $19 million on Monday and Tuesday, respectively, the data shows. Bitcoin’s price hovered around 70,440 at 7:30 a.m. ET — up nearly 7% from a week ago. Grayscale’s bitcoin product has seen net outflows every trading day since converting to an ETF on Jan. 11. The GBTC asset oozing peaked at $642 million on March 18. The trust’s hemorrhaging of assets was somewhat expected, in part because of GBTC’s 1.5% fee — a significantly higher price point than the nine competing spot bitcoin ETFs that launched on the same day. Read more: GBTC net outflows reach $10 billion two months after ETF conversion GBTC’s net outflows of $17.5 million on Wednesday fell below the previous low of $22 million on Feb. 26. ETF.com senior analyst Sumit Roy told Blockworks at the time that he believed the initial selling by arbitrageurs and those wanting to move to cheaper funds was “largely over.” GBTC outflows ramped up in the days after, however, rising to nearly $600 million on Feb. 29. Some segment observers attributed continued GBTC outflows in recent weeks to bankrupt lender Genesis offloading its shares of the fund. The company’s stake in the Grayscale fund was worth roughly $1.6 billion in mid-February. But Genesis and its affiliates had “fully monetized” their nearly 36 million GBTC shares as of April 2, court documents note — and proceeds of the sales were used to buy 32,041 BTC. “I think it’s much too soon to call the end of GBTC’s outflows,” Roy told Blockworks Thursday. “We need to see many days of small outflows — or even inflows — before we can make that call.” The GBTC ETF’s net outflows stand at nearly $16 billion overall. Despite that total weighing down the broader US spot bitcoin fund category down, the segment has notched $12.5 billion of net inflows during their three months on the market.

While some investors believe that stricter regulations will contribute to legitimizing the sector, others worry that excessive intervention by regulatory bodies may undermine its decentralized appeal. During the first half of 2023, Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies made a recovery after experiencing significant losses in 2022. Nevertheless, the persisting crypto winter has revealed vulnerabilities within the digital currency markets, such as excessive risk-taking, unlawful promotion of securities, and blatant fraudulent activities. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is a federal agency responsible for overseeing and regulating traditional markets in the United States. It was established in 1934 in response to the economic turmoil of the Great Depression. The primary goals of the Securities and Exchange Commission are to safeguard the interests of investors and ensure the integrity, fairness, and efficiency of the financial markets. The Securities and Exchange Commission plays a vital role in enforcing federal securities laws and overseeing the securities industry, as well as the stock and options exchanges in the United States. Under the leadership of Gary Gensler, the SEC’s primary objective is to ensure that public companies follow transparent practices. This involves ensuring that companies provide accurate and consistent information to investors, enabling them to make well-informed decisions regarding their investments. By promoting transparency and accountability, the Securities and Exchange Commission aims to create a fair and trustworthy investment environment for individuals and institutions. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is taking a prominent role in advocating for the application of comprehensive financial regulations to cryptocurrency markets. In April 2022, Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler expressed his view that the top five exchanges, which account for the majority of cryptocurrency trading, are likely engaged in trading securities. As a result, he emphasized the importance of these exchanges registering with the Securities and Exchange Commission and adhering to relevant laws. Located in Washington DC, the Securities and Exchange Commission holds a crucial position in shaping the future of the cryptocurrency industry. As the primary overseer of the U.S. financial markets, the decisions and regulations implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission carry significant weight and influence over the trajectory of the crypto industry. The SEC’s classification of specific coins as crypto asset securities can have far-reaching consequences. It determines their legal standing, trading methodologies, and overall perception within the market. This classification also has implications for investor safeguards and the taxation aspects of cryptocurrency transactions. Consequently, the SEC’s actions play a pivotal role in shaping the regulatory environment and establishing standards for the cryptocurrency industry in the United States. The increasing crackdown on cryptocurrencies raises concerns about potential challenges for U.S. investors in trading their preferred digital assets, and it also poses a risk to the decentralized nature that initially attracted many crypto investors. Nevertheless, numerous experts are of the opinion that clear regulations are necessary for cryptocurrency exchanges to instill a sense of security among investors. This sentiment arises particularly in the wake of several incidents over the past year, including the bankruptcy of numerous crypto exchanges, lenders, and funds. Having well-defined regulations can help establish a safer and more stable environment for investors to participate in the cryptocurrency market. By implementing such regulations, the aim is to strike a balance between maintaining investor protection and fostering the continued growth and innovation within the crypto space. Ripple achieved a partial victory in its legal battle against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, as a court ruling provided some clarity regarding regulations in the cryptocurrency industry. The U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York determined that the sale of Ripple’s XRP tokens on exchanges and through algorithms did not qualify as investment contracts. However, the court concluded that the institutional sale of the tokens violated federal securities laws. Following the ruling, XRP experienced a rally, and crypto exchange Gemini expressed the possibility of listing the token. Nevertheless, initial analysis from legal experts suggests that the ruling does not fully resolve the question of whether a digital asset meets the definition of a security under U.S. law and under what specific circumstances. In addition to targeting crypto exchanges and other platforms, the Securities and Exchange Commission has taken action against several celebrities for their involvement in illegally promoting cryptocurrency assets. In October 2022, Kim Kardashian, a well-known celebrity, paid $1.26 million in penalties to the SEC for her role in promoting EthereumMax without disclosing the payments she received in exchange. The list of celebrities facing similar charges continues to grow and includes individuals such as Jake Paul, a social media influencer, Lindsay Lohan, an actress, DeAndre Cortez Way (Soulja Boy), a musician, Aliaune Thiam (Akon), a musician, Floyd Mayweather Jr., a boxer, Khaled Khaled (DJ Khaled), a music producer, and Paul Pierce, a basketball player. These individuals have all faced legal action for their alleged involvement in unlawfully promoting cryptocurrency assets.

459::https://theconversation.com/what-is-the-real-value-of-a-bitcoin-96386::The Conversation::article::What is the real value of a bitcoin?::One of the hot questions regarding the bitcoin since the first ones were created in 2009 is its real value. We will try as well to answer to this question using two concepts in economics and finance.::One of the hot questions regarding the bitcoin since the first ones were created in January 2009 is its real value. According to Warren Buffett, the most influential investor in the world, the answer to this question would be: not much. We will try as well to answer to this question using two concepts in economics and finance: minimal (or residual) value and Ponzi schemes. The minimal value approach is a prudent approach. Under this approach we would like to know what value remains when everything goes wrong as in cases of market disruption or economic crisis. Before we try to value a bitcoin we would need to define it as a currency or as an investment. Its use as a means of payment with some merchants can lead us to see the bitcoin as a currency not tied to a country and without central bank. Bitcoins are usually measured in terms of their exchange rate to the Japanese Yen and US dollar as these two currencies remain the main currencies for which bitcoins are exchanged. We will now try to value bitcoins as a currency using the minimal-value approach. All major currencies have a central bank that monitors the exchange rate of their currency respective to other currencies and mostly to the dollar. Contrary to most traded currencies, bitcoin does not have a central bank or an entity monitoring its exchange rate. Therefore, bitcoin exchange rate to the dollar or to the Japanese yen could theoretically go down to zero. As some academics and practitioners would qualify it bitcoin cannot be considered as a currency but as an investment. In finance, we would measure an investment’s intrinsic value as the sum of future revenues it generates (with a discount to account for time). Bitcoins do not generate any present or future revenues. Therefore, as an investment and using a minimal value approach bitcoins have a zero minimal value. Some assets do not generate revenues, the best known unproductive asset being gold. Bitcoin has frequently been compared to gold given that it cannot be considered as a currency but like an investment that generates no revenues. Using our minimal-value approach, we can assume that gold has a minimal market value due to its industrial use. Indeed, the value as an industrial good of gold would become the minimal value even if it would have no value as a financial investment. Again, bitcoin at this stage does not have any industrial use and could not pretend to such minimal value. That said, to avoid a totally biased view of the bitcoin, we could argue on one potential value for it as an investment – finance methods see a value in diversification. For asset managers with large investment portfolios, one value of bitcoin could therefore come from the fact that bitcoin is not fully correlated to financial markets. Then after all we have seen, why do bitcoins have a value on the market? As Warren Buffet puts it, “All you’re counting on is the next person is going to pay you more”. This answer corresponds to the definition of a Ponzi scheme. A Ponzi scheme can be defined as a dishonest investment scheme where older investors are paid by new entering investors. For the Ponzi scheme to work you need to have a continuous stream of new investors. In this type of system only one manager works at attracting new investors. In the case of bitcoin, the specificity relies on the fact that all owners become bitcoin managers in most cases without knowing it. Ponzi schemes do not usually give solid grounds for an asset value. Again, assets valued through a Ponzi scheme end up having no value once the Ponzi scheme unravels or collapses. Ponzi schemes usually collapse in times of crisis, when it lacks new entrants or when people try to massively withdraw from it. If the bitcoin system proves to be a Ponzi scheme, the next economic downturn may soon unravel it and bring down bitcoin to its minimal value: not much.::2018-05-16T20:40:00Z::Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, Currencies, Financial markets, Fraud, Ponzi scheme, The Conversation France::Dejan Glavas::En anglais::https://images.theconversation.com/files/219094/original/file-20180515-195324-k3oge4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=6%2C832%2C4019%2C2009&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a broad measurement of the digital asset market as a whole, fell almost 1.1%. Ether declined more than 2% to just above $2,900, while solana was largely unchanged at $145. In the next 24 hours, attention will turn to inflation reports out of the U.S. The latest Producer Price Index (PPI) is set for release at 08:30 ET today and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is due tomorrow. Stubbornly high inflation has previously put paid to hopes of rate cuts in the U.S., which can have the effect of a handbrake on risk assets such as crypto. The rally in GameStop (GME) stock has prompted a surge in meme coins PEPE, FLOKI and MOG. A post on X by retail trader @TheRoaringKitty, who was at the center of the GME short squeeze in 2021, sent the video-game retailer's stock flying on Monday, triggering a rally in the major meme tokens. PEPE, FLOKI and MOG all jumped as much as 30% in the last 24 hours, suggesting traders may be preempting a repeat of the DOGE rally in 2021 which occurred following GME's surge. "Roaring Kitty's return was perceived as bullish for meme coins because the market remembered that much of the GameStop mania of 2021 spilled over to $DOGE and other meme coins,” MOG token developer Shisui told CoinDesk in a message. Coinbase (COIN) suffered a three-hour outage from 04:15 UTC on Tuesday, returning to use at 07:42, according to its status page. Website visitors had received a "503 Service Temporarily Unavailable" message beforehand. While the outage has been tackled, Coinbase noted that some users may still experience failure when sending crypto or withdrawing fiat. COIN shares were down around 2.25% at $195 during mid-morning in Europe before the U.S. market opened. The bitcoin price appeared to be unaffected. Coinbase had noted that "Your funds are safe," in a post on X during the outage, and did not disclose anything further on the nature of the problem. - Omkar Godbole Disclosure Please note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.

462::https://blockworks.co/news/liquid-staked-bitcoin-yield-option-btc-holders::Blockworks::article::Liquid staked bitcoin provides new yield option for BTC holders::The Nomic DAO Foundation is adding Babylon's bitcoin staking protocol into its decentralized non-custodial Bitcoin bridge to create stBTC.::Nomic and Babylon team up to offer stBTC, a bitcoin with built-in staking yield but without lockups Shutterstock.AI modified by Blockworks When it comes to tokenizing bitcoin on other chains, no one has reached any significant scale besides BitGo’s wrapped bitcoin (wBTC). Newer approaches aim to offer a non-custodial option for using BTC off of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Nomic DAO Foundation is adding Babylon’s bitcoin staking protocol into its decentralized non-custodial Bitcoin bridge to create stBTC, which they call a Bitcoin Liquid Staking Token (LST). BitGo custodies bitcoin and issues the wBTC token — predominantly as an ERC-20 on Ethereum and its layer-2s. It has amassed a market cap of $10.6 billion, more than fifty times its nearest rival, per CoinGecko. Nomic’s main goal is to make a more decentralized alternative to wBTC available in DeFi on other chains connected via IBC. Read more: Nomic kicks off native Bitcoin bridging to Cosmos with 21 BTC The new twist is to allow those BTC holders to passively earn a yield on their bitcoin — which is where Babylon comes in. Nomic enables the conversion of BTC to nBTC tokens, the IBC-compatible token which can be used to mint stBTC through a staking pool. While nBTC is Cosmos-native bitcoin, stBTC is a claim on partial ownership of nBTC, which — after an unstaking period — can be withdrawn back to the Bitcoin network as native BTC. Unlike traditional BTC yield options that lock up the asset, Nomic’s approach lets stBTC move across IBC-compatible chains to remain liquid while still earning periodic rewards for stakers, much like Lido stETH does for ether stakers. Read more: Let’s talk Bitcoin staking: Babylon’s litepaper One key difference is that stETH accrues value in more stETH from the native staking yield of Ethereum. Babylon’s bitcoin staking yield comes from the tokens of other chains that want to tap into bitcoin’s economic heft to help with their own security, according to Matt Bell, CEO of Turbofish, Nomic’s developer. “In the beginning, I think it’ll just be [Babylon’s] BBN token, but then eventually, as more and more chains come online using Babylon for security, if they choose to get security from all this pool of staked bitcoin, then they’re paying out their tokens as well,” Bell told Blockworks. For example, Nomic will use stBTC itself, to launch “a dual-stake security system,” which adds staked BTC to underpin Nomic’s chain in addition to its own token NOM, making it one of the first proof-of-stake (PoS) chains to implement such a solution. Stakers will receive rewards in both NOM and nBTC, Bell said. “The Babylon design is really as trust minimized as you can get,” he added. David Tse, co-founder of Babylon, has been focused on opening up yield opportunities for native BTC with less counterparty risk than options that rely on centralized intermediaries. Read more: Digital Asset Summit Day 1: Yield is a Trojan horse for technological revolution “This is a major step forward for Bitcoin holders that will allow them to use their staked bitcoin for DeFi, while still supporting the security of proof-of-stake systems,” Tse said. Currently available in a testnet environment, stBTC will move on to a mainnet release alongside Babylon mainnet, a Nomic spokesperson said. Tse previously targeted April for Babylon mainnet, depending on the outcome of security audits. “It’s just so powerful how big the numbers are — bitcoin is at like a $1.3 trillion market cap, which is insanely huge,” Bell said. “So it’s just a no-brainer if you can unlock a few use cases for earning yield on that bitcoin — since those people are just going to be holding it anyway.” Updated Apr. 10 at 12:20 ET: Clarifying that stBTC mainnet is linked to Babylon mainnet release.

Typically, they are associated with the introduction of a new project or cryptocurrency, aiming to attract a larger user base in a market crowded with numerous crypto tokens and coins. They represent a brilliant strategy for promoting a new cryptocurrency project. Just consider this: who wouldn’t be enticed by the opportunity to acquire complimentary coins? An airdrop possesses the capability to generate awareness, initiate the utilization of a novel currency, and foster a community of enthusiastic users and advocates. They serve as an affordable means for investors to acquire newly launched cryptocurrencies, with the potential for significant profits if the distributed tokens appreciate in value over time. However, it’s important to note that while airdrops are often seen as an opportunity for “free money,” there are no guarantees regarding the value of the tokens or even the occurrence of an airdrop. Some projects may deny the existence of a token or choose not to distribute tokens altogether. There are two types of crypto airdrops: retroactive and takeover , with key differences between the two being at which stage they are being offered and their specific purpose. A common type of airdrop is one that rewards users who have actively participated in or contributed to a project prior to a specific date. This particular strategy aims to generate excitement and anticipation for an upcoming token launch. By incentivizing early involvement, it facilitates community expansion and enhances liquidity within the project. This type of airdrop is designed to specifically target and attract users and liquidity providers who are actively engaged in activities like staking within decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. The aim is to entice them away from competing platforms by offering higher rewards. By enticing users with increased incentives, the intention is to not only attract them to the project but also to retain their participation and loyalty over time. Related: What is Polkadot (DOT)? Is it a good investment in 2024? Indeed, organizing and executing airdrops can be time-consuming and require substantial effort. There is always a inherent risk involved where the tokens may not be actively used or adopted by the recipients. In such cases, the airdrop can potentially become an ineffective use of time and resources. Due to the lack of a track record or a relatively short one, there is an elevated risk that a protocol associated with an airdrop may experience bugs or vulnerabilities. To mitigate the potential risk of losing your entire holdings, it is advisable to utilize a burner wallet for each airdrop opportunity. By employing separate wallets for each airdrop, you can minimize the potential impact of any vulnerabilities or exploits on your cryptocurrency. It is crucial to exercise caution and remain vigilant against scams on social media that masquerade as airdrop opportunities. These fraudulent actors often provide links to malicious websites designed to compromise your wallet security. It is essential never to disclose your seed phrase or private key or send money to any account claiming to offer an airdrop. Such requests are typically red flags and should be treated with suspicion to protect your assets and personal information. This blog is for educational purposes only.

465::https://theconversation.com/cryptojacking-spreads-across-the-web-94088::The Conversation::article::Cryptojacking spreads across the web::Enterprising cryptocurrency enthusiasts have found a way to use your computer processor and electricity to make themselves money. What is cryptojacking, and how does it work?::Right now, your computer might be using its memory and processor power – and your electricity – to generate money for someone else, without you ever knowing. It’s called “cryptojacking,” and it is an offshoot of the rising popularity of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Instead of minting coins or printing paper money, creating new units of cryptocurrencies, which is called “mining,” involves performing complex mathematical calculations. These intentionally difficult calculations securely record transactions among people using the cryptocurrency and provide an objective record of the “order” in which transactions are conducted. The user who successfully completes each calculation gets a reward in the form of a tiny amount of that cryptocurrency. That helps offset the main costs of mining, which involve buying advanced computer processors and paying for electricity to run them. It is not surprising that enterprising cryptocurrency enthusiasts have found a way to increase their profits, mining currency for themselves by using other people’s processing and electrical power. Our security research group at Michigan State University is presently focused on researching ransomware and cryptojacking – the two biggest threats to user security in 2018. Our preliminary web crawl identified 212 websites involved in cryptojacking. There are two forms of cryptojacking; one is like other malware attacks and involves tricking a user into downloading a mining application to their computer. It’s far easier, however, just to lure visitors to a webpage that includes a script their web browser software runs or to embed a mining script in a common website. Another variant of this latter approach is to inject cryptomining scripts into ad networks that legitimate websites then unknowingly serve to their visitors. The mining script can be very small – just a few lines of text that download a small program from a web server, activate it on the user’s own browser and tell the program where to credit any mined cryptocurrency. The user’s computer and electricity do all the work, and the person who wrote the code gets all the proceeds. The computer’s owner may never even realize what’s going on. There are legitimate purposes for this sort of embedded cryptocurrency mining – if it is disclosed to users rather than happening secretly. Salon, for example, is asking its visitors to help provide financial support for the site in one of two ways: Either allow the site to display advertising, for which Salon gets paid, or let the site conduct cryptocurrency mining while reading its articles. That’s a case when the site is making very clear to users what it’s doing, including the effect on their computers’ performance, so there is not a problem. More recently, a UNICEF charity allows people to donate their computer’s processing power to mine cryptocurrency. However, many sites do not let users know what is happening, so they are engaging in cryptojacking. Our initial analysis indicates that many sites with cryptojacking software are engaged in other dubious practices: Some of them are classified by internet security firm FortiGuard as “malicious websites,” known to be homes for destructive and malicious software. Other cryptojacking sites were classified as “pornography” sites, many of which appeared to be hosting or indexing potentially illegal pornographic content.  The problem is so severe that Google recently announced it would ban all extensions that involved cryptocurrency mining from its Chrome browser – regardless of whether the mining was done openly or in secret. The longer a person stays on a cryptojacked website, the more cryptocurrency their computer will mine. The most successful cryptojacking efforts are on streaming media sites, because they have lots of visitors who stay a long time. While legitimate streaming websites such as YouTube and Netflix are safe for users, some sites that host pirated videos are targeting visitors for cryptojacking. Other sites extend a user’s apparent visit time by opening a tiny additional browser window and placing it in a hard-to-spot part of the screen, say, behind the taskbar. So even after a user closes the original window, the site stays connected and continues to mine cryptocurrency. The amount of electricity a computer uses depends on what it’s doing. Mining is very processor-intensive – and that activity requires more power. So a laptop’s battery will drain faster if it’s mining, like when it’s displaying a 4K video or handling a 3D rendering. Similarly, a desktop computer will draw more power from the wall, both to power the processor and to run fans to prevent the machine from overheating. And even with proper cooling, the increased heat can take its own toll over the long term, damaging hardware and slowing down the computer. This harms not only individuals whose computers are hijacked for cryptocurrency mining, but also universities, companies and other large organizations. A large number of cryptojacked machines across an institution can consume substantial amounts of electricity and damage large numbers of computers. Users may be able to recognize cryptojacking on their own. Because it involves increasing processor activity, the computer’s temperature can climb – and the computer’s fan may activate or run more quickly in an attempt to cool things down. People who are concerned their computers may have been subjected to cryptojacking should run an up-to-date antivirus program. While cryptojacking scripts are not necessarily actual computer viruses, most antivirus software packages also check for other types of malicious software. That usually includes identifying and blocking mining malware and even browser-based mining scripts. Installing software updates may also help users block attacks that try to download cryptojacking software or other malicious programs to their computers. In addition, browser add-ons that block mining scripts can reduce the likelihood of being cryptojacked by code embedded in websites. Further, users should either turn off or use a strong password to secure remote services such as Microsoft’s Remote Desktop Connection or secure shell (SSH) access. Cryptocurrency mining can be a legitimate source of revenue – but not when done secretly or by hijacking others’ computers to do the work and having them pay the resulting financial costs.::2018-05-08T10:43:39Z::Cryptocurrency, Malware::Pranshu Bajpai::Home::https://images.theconversation.com/files/217091/original/file-20180501-135837-y8qre9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C510%2C5491%2C2741&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
466::https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/15/galaxy-digital-has-strong-momentum-across-all-business-lines-canaccord/::CoinDesk::article::Galaxy Digital Has Strong Momentum Across All Business Lines: Canaccord::The approval of spot bitcoin ETFs was a catalyst for the increase in counterparty engagement in the first quarter as more traditional asset managers and hedge funds entered the industry, the report said.::Galaxy Digital (GLXY) is evolving its business in a thoughtful and methodical way and, while the regulatory backdrop remains challenging, the company’s opportunity set and competitive positioning remains compelling, broker Canaccord Genuity said in a report on Tuesday after the crypto financial services firm published first-quarter results. The Toronto-based company founded by CEO Mike Novogratz said net income rose 40% from the quarter before to $422 million, and the broker said it expects the positive momentum to continue. “We are encouraged to see solid progress in growth and maturation in each of the company’s three operating units coming into view over the next few quarters,” analysts led by Joseph Vafi wrote. Galaxy Trading grew its total number of counterparties to 1,161 in the first quarter from 1,052 in the fourth, and counterparty trading revenue rose 79% to $66 million, the report noted. The approval of spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January was behind the development. “Spot bitcoin ETF approvals have been a major catalyst for the increase in counterparty engagement as some of the more traditional asset managers and hedge funds are entering/reentering the space,” the authors wrote. GalaxyOne also saw further traction, with over 75 institutional clients and more than $1 billion of assets on the platform, the note said. “This is a great set of customers for the company to offer its full suite of products, including custody, lending, spot trading, hedging and derivatives.” The asset-management business also enjoyed good momentum, ending the quarter with assets under management (AUM) of $7.8 billion, an increase of 50% on the previous quarter, Canaccord said. “Galaxy continues to grow its infrastructure and GK8 business, growing its assets under stake by 100% quarter-on-quarter to $486m,” the report added. The firm bought self-custody platform GK8 for $44 million in February last year. The firm also increased its proprietary mining hashrate and the Helios facility “presents an opportunity for Galaxy to pursue both mining and AI hosting over time,” the broker said. Canaccord has a buy rating on Galaxy shares with a C$17 price target. The stock closed at C$12.41 on Tuesday. Read more: Galaxy Plans to Raise $100M for Crypto Venture Fund Edited by Sheldon Reback.

468::https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-halving-different-institutions-investors::Blockworks::article::This Bitcoin halving will be different — the institutions are here::Opinion: The fourth Bitcoin halving will be unlike any other that came before: Professional investors have entered crypto.::I believe that the upcoming halving will be unlike any other that came before it for one key reason: Professional investors have entered crypto Artwork by Crystal Le Shortly after Bitcoin’s 15th “birthday” in January 2024, the digital asset community crossed a long-awaited turning point — the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval of 11 spot bitcoin ETFs. To many industry participants, this marked digital assets’ decades-long transformation from a niche curiosity among “cypherpunks” to an alternative asset class garnering serious attention from some of the world’s largest asset managers. The community is now bracing for another major milestone in the coming weeks — the fourth Bitcoin halving. Crypto natives know the drill: The previous three halvings have largely followed a distinct pattern of heightened market activity, causing prices to rally before moving into a correction phase. While we can look to the past to anticipate how the market might respond, I believe that the upcoming halving will be unlike any other that came before it for one key reason: Professional investors have entered crypto. Read more from our opinion section: The 2024 halving could usher in a new era for Bitcoin For the first time in conjunction with a halving, private wealth, family offices and large traditional financial institutions have started meaningfully incorporating digital assets both into their investment portfolios and product offerings. It is a shift in how the entire industry has been operating, and it means that this halving’s aftereffects will be different from all the rest. Each Bitcoin halving over the past 15 years has marked a milestone in the evolution of digital assets. At the first halving in 2012, digital assets remained an esoteric niche driven by the technological curiosity and libertarian ethos of early adopters. During the second halving in 2016, mainstream awareness had intensified, so much so that the world’s leading derivatives marketplace, CME Group launched its Bitcoin price indices later that year, laying the first foundations for what was then nascent institutional curiosity. By the third halving in 2020, the landscape had transformed dramatically, with digital assets capturing the hearts and wallets of retail investors. The proliferation of user-friendly investment platforms catalyzed accessibility, which in turn fuelled a surge in mainstream adoption. Read more: The history of Bitcoin halvings — and why this time might look different Yet as of 2020, the majority of professional investors remained on the sidelines of crypto amid lingering questions about the asset class’ role in a credible investment portfolio and its legal standing. Those who were prepared to get their feet wet soon realized there was a lack of trusted exchanges, platforms and custodians that could uphold the regulatory, operational and security standards expected of any professional counterparty. The demand for experienced institutional-grade counterparties remained unmet in the digital asset space, especially in Asia. It was a key driver in our decision to launch DBS Digital Exchange in December 2020. Recognizing the market gap, other financial institutions have also launched digital asset platforms since then. Everything changed in 2022, when the industry suffered a massive crisis of confidence following the billion-dollar collapses of major crypto exchanges and hedge funds. Notably, these events were triggered not by a failure of blockchain technology but instead by poor risk management and corporate governance. Investors — once bitten twice shy — realized that relying on unregulated platforms meant exposing their digital asset portfolios to significant operational and technology risk, in addition to the already complex task of managing a highly volatile asset class. To mitigate these risks, investors began to either self-custody their portfolios or shift their digital assets into trusted platforms — often, those that adhere to the same benchmarks expected of traditional financial institutions, particularly in the areas of risk management, asset segregation, financial stability and anti-money laundering. Regulators in key financial hubs such as Singapore also began imposing requirements on digital asset platforms to meet these standards as well. Digital asset platforms, recognizing these structural changes, either adapted accordingly, uprooted to jurisdictions with less robust requirements or exited the business entirely. Far from sounding the death knell for the industry, the worst crisis to befall digital assets actually triggered its transformation into a professionally managed asset class. With this timeline in mind, what can we expect from the fourth Bitcoin halving? Given that each halving marks a reduction in the supply of new Bitcoins mined, we will likely witness a period of strong buying demand in anticipation of a rally, just like in previous halvings. This has already started, with bitcoin recently breaking its previous all-time high. However, what will set this halving apart is the wave of professional investors — who were previously on the fence — now overcoming past skepticism to enter a more professionally-run market. We could also witness market participation from asset management firms and funds, like spot ETFs, with their newfound appetite to deal with cryptocurrency. Read more: The Bitcoin halving is about a month away — here’s what you can expect This trend has already begun. A Glassnode report shows that the supply of Bitcoin held by large entities — such as institutions, funds, custodians and OTC desks — increased by 13.4% from 2020 to 2021, and that the number of large entities holding Bitcoin itself increased by more than 27%. Fast-forward to 2023: A torrent of institutional-focused bitcoin products pre-ETF approval, (and expectations of an actual ETF approval), arguably contributed to the rally that began toward the end of last year. According to research by Coinshares, 2023 saw $2.25 billion of inflows into digital asset investment products, the third largest year of such inflows since 2018. The stage is set for professional investors to expand their share of participation in the market. Unlike previous halvings where bitcoin prices corrected sharply within months after a new all-time high, the post-halving sell pressure this time may be moderated due to this new composition of investors. As these new investors bring the weight of their capital to bear, they will also bring along a heightened awareness of the risks that come with unlicensed and untested platforms. As such, this time professional investors will place greater emphasis on working with counterparties sporting the right credentials, thereby enabling them to focus on managing the investment aspects of their portfolios with complete peace of mind, and not having to fret over managing operational and technology risk. These “right” credentials include infrastructure and practices such as bankruptcy remoteness, regular independent audits, robust cybersecurity, tested risk management processes and adequate liquidity protections. Moreover, as digital assets get increasingly adopted into alternative portfolios, platforms that seamlessly integrate with other financial services — such as the ability to manage digital assets alongside traditional assets, or access to tokenized investment opportunities – could also have a competitive advantage over pure-play digital asset platforms. The ecosystem of platforms in the market will inevitably gravitate in this direction as professional investors will be more comfortable working with such counterparties. Taking everything into consideration, the fourth Bitcoin halving is poised to set itself apart as the turning point that crystalized a transformative shift in the digital asset industry — one that has matured into a trusted and professionally-run ecosystem.

These unique digital assets have seen billions of dollars in trading volume and have garnered significant attention from celebrities, thereby thrusting digital artwork into the limelight of mainstream media outlets. Creating NFTs involves utilizing specialized platforms that enable users to generate and upload their artwork onto a blockchain. In this guide, we will provide you with a step-by-step process to create your first non-fungible token. We will cover crucial aspects such as uploading your artwork, selecting the appropriate blockchain, and determining where to list it for potential sale. Now we need to create a picture for our NFT. You can create it yourself or use the AI. To create a picture you can use:Midjourney, Gencraft, AIGreeam or other. Creating a picture on all sites is very similar. You need to give a description of the picture you want to get and choose a style (Cartoon, Anime, Cyberpunk). We used Midjourney and this description to create our picture:”The villain is a hamster in a costume against the backdrop of the city. In a dark atmosphere” Wallets serve as the applications that allow you to securely store your cryptocurrencies, as well as any non-fungible tokens (NFTs) you acquire through minting or purchasing. MetaMask is a widely supported wallet among Ethereum-based applications such as OpenSea, Foundation, and others. It can be accessed either as a Chrome/Firefox extension or as an iOS/Android app. Additionally, Coinbase offers its own wallet, which is compatible with various platforms and can be used as an extension or an app. Coinbase’s wallet is particularly suitable if you intend to delve into the broader cryptocurrency space, as it supports blockchains beyond Ethereum, including Bitcoin. To establish a wallet, you’ll need to follow a few steps. First, download the cryptocurrency wallet app of your choice. Next, create a username and password to secure your wallet. It’s crucial to ensure that your private keys and recovery phrase are stored offline to maintain their safety and enable backup functionality. Given the multitude of platforms available for selling non-fungible tokens across various blockchains, it becomes challenging for a single guide to encompass them all, let alone determine the most suitable platform for your specific project. The vast array of options makes it necessary for individuals to explore and assess different platforms to identify the one that aligns best with their unique requirements. OpenSea has emerged as the leading and most popular NFT platform to date. Since its establishment in 2017, it has facilitated over $20 billion in trading volume and showcases more than 2 million NFT collections. OpenSea primarily focuses on Ethereum-based non-fungible tokens. In July 2022, OpenSea expanded its support to include Solana non-fungible tokens, broadening its offerings to cater to the Solana blockchain ecosystem. Solanart is a prominent non-fungible token platform specifically designed for Solana-based NFTs. It hosts a variety of highly regarded Solana NFT collections and boasts a user-friendly interface, making the minting process straightforward and accessible. Additionally, several cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance Exchange, provide support for NFT creation. These exchanges enable users to directly create their non-fungible tokens on the platform, select their preferred blockchain, and mint or generate the NFT seamlessly within the exchange environment. In this case we will use Rarible. It is an Ethereum-based platform. After you’ve got your wallet set up, you’ll want to connect it with the NFT marketplace you plan on using. OpenSea and Rarible make this easy — clicking the Create button in the top left prompts you to connect your wallet. You’ll then be presented with a list of compatible wallets, and choosing yours will prompt you to go through the connection process. Various blockchains have the capability to store your non-fungible tokens securely. It is vital to select the most suitable blockchain that meets your specific needs as it will maintain a permanent record of your NFT. When you begin the NFT minting process on Rarible, the first query you will encounter is regarding the choice of blockchain for minting your NFT. Rarible presents you with several options, including Ethereum, Flow, Tezos, and Polygon. It’s important to note that unlike OpenSea, Rarible does not cover the fees associated with using the Polygon blockchain. Therefore, if you opt for Polygon, you will be responsible for paying the necessary fees for minting or selling your non-fungible token. For the purpose of this example, we will proceed with Ethereum as the selected blockchain on Rarible. After choosing single on Rarible, you’ll end up on the NFT creation screen. The first thing to do is upload the digital file you’re hoping to sell as an NFT, using the Choose File button. In this scenario, let’s assume that we will list our NFT on Rarible for a fixed price. We can enter the desired price into the corresponding field. Additionally, we have the option to select the currency in which we would like to receive payment, although potential buyers can still make offers using different currencies. It’s important to keep in mind that when setting the price, Rarible will charge a 2.5 percent fee in the event that our NFT sells. The next two options let you use choose your collection (we’ll go with Rarible Singles for our example), and the Free Minting option, which lets you choose whether you want to use Rarible’s lazy minting system. You then give your NFT a name — or title — and a description if you want. Finally, you can choose the royalty percentage. This will change how much of each subsequent sale goes back to you in the future. For example, if someone purchases your non-fungible token for 0.2 ETH and then sells it for 1 ETH in the future, you’ll get a percentage of that sale as well — by default, it’s 10 percent (so 0.1 ETH in our example). Before finalizing the process, it is crucial to carefully review and ensure that all the details are exactly as desired. Modifying certain aspects later on may either incur substantial expenses or prove to be impossible. Therefore, it is important to exercise caution and thoroughness. Once you are confident that your non-fungible token is ready to be published, you can proceed by clicking the “Create Item” button to complete the process. Upon granting the necessary wallet requests and experiencing a brief waiting period, you will receive a notification stating that your NFT has been successfully created. You can click the “View NFT” button to access and inspect your newly created NFT. To view your collection, you can navigate to your profile picture located in the top right corner and click on “My Profile.” This will allow you to explore and manage your collection of non-fungible tokens.

NFT markets show strength::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) non-fungible token (NFT) collection surpassed Pudgy Penguins’ floor price this Thursday, according to data from price platform NFT Price Floor. The trading volume of BAYC collection also grew by 27% in the last 24 hours, data from on-chain research firm Nansen shows, surpassing 2,394 ETH. Pudgy Penguins’ volume fell 58% in the same period. The reason behind the 6.5% leap in BAYC’s NFTs floor price is the announcement that Greg Solano will be returning to his role as CEO at Yuga Labs. Solano is one of the four creators of Yuga Labs, the company behind BAYC. Moreover, Nansen analyzed the rising trading volume of BAYC NFTs after Solano’s post to identify which addresses have been accumulating. An address started with 0x360 withdrew crypto from Binance to fund a fresh wallet before the announcement, and bought four BAYCs right after. The same address ended up buying a fifth NFT a few hours later. Another address, starting with 0x68a, bought three BAYC NFTs over the last six days. However, this movement falls short when compared to the 61 BAYCs bought by the wallet starting with 0x95f between Feb. 13 and 21. This address even received 10 other NFTs from the same collection. In the last seven days, the NFT has shown positive numbers in different aspects. Data aggregator CryptoSlam points out that sales volume grew 12% in one week, with over $297 million in NFT being traded. The rise in volume was met with a growth in transactions, which went up by almost 6%, surpassing 2.3 million. Yet, the biggest rises were seen in the numbers of buyers and sellers, which went up by 53.4% and 57.1%, respectively.

471::https://theconversation.com/bitcoins-wild-ride-and-whats-ahead-for-the-cryptocurrency-94801::The Conversation::article::Bitcoin’s wild ride and what’s ahead for the cryptocurrency::The fate of Bitcoin’s fate is highly unpredictable and dependent on what governments will do in the future.::Bitcoin has been on a volatile ride in recent times, its value rising and falling like a kite caught in variable winds. Its future will likely be as unpredictable as its past given that it’s a currency propped up by risk-takers, a target of lawmakers and tied to nothing more substantial than an algorithm. But there are certain variables and concurrent conditions that are signals worth watching when considering Bitcoin’s future. An international research team comprised of me, Theodore Panagiotidis at the University of Macedonia in Greece and Orestis Vravosinos at the Barcelona Graduate School of Economics in Spain recently analyzed a broad spectrum of data representing several years in the life of Bitcoin. It was our attempt to reach a deeper understanding of what drives the cryptocurrency’s value. Can you really predict how investors will behave around something with so many layers of complexity — around what is essentially a black box system and the subject of so much hype? It’s not an easy task. We set out to bring a measure of predictability to the path the cryptocurrency will take. We looked closely at 21 variables that could potentially affect Bitcoin returns. Vital market determinants like gold and oil prices, various currency exchange rates and stock market indexes from around the world were part of the mix. Government policy-related economic uncertainty, along with the internet search intensity of Bitcoin, were crucial areas of our research. We took more than 2,500 observations of variables spanning a seven-year period and filtered it through what’s known as a LASSO — a “least absolute shrinkage and selection operator.” It’s an analytical model to determine what the possible predictors, or covariates, might be. We found that of all the many variables, the amount of online chatter about Bitcoin, along with gold returns, and uncertainty over government policy stand out as possible predictors. Having said that, Bitcoin is a moving target that appears not to conform to any logical patterns. In relationship to gold, Bitcoin’s value tends to rise as gold rises. But will that remain consistent if the economy stumbles? In those circumstances, investors seek the safer haven of gold, American dollars and euros, entities they know to have value supported by governments and central banks. The riskier currencies, like the crypto ones, might be abandoned. There are many cryptocurrencies in circulation, but Bitcoin has outstripped them all in popularity, mostly because it is cloaked in mystery and because of the media attention surrounding its dramatic value fluxes. There is a fascination with something that is new, that is technologically created and that’s hard to hack. The idea of having a Bitcoin network that can evade governments is alluring to people. We found that the general chatter and interest surrounding Bitcoin, positive and negative alike, is a main determinant of its value. We used Google and Wikipedia analytics to measure the hype. Bitcoin as a means of exchange has been running under the radar of regulation over the entirety of its nine-year lifespan. But we cannot see that scenario continuing for long. And it seems that investors are also mindful of the looming possibility of regulatory oversight since Bitcoin’s value tends to respond negatively when there is speculation about government action. With Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, transactions are conducted free of taxation. We can’t be sure what the nature of those transactions are, but often cryptocurrencies are used to avoid taxes or duties, or to engage in illicit commerce, which makes them even more shadowy, darkly appealing currencies. It’s not clear how governments will ultimately respond to this tax-free commerce, but we can be certain that they’ll eventually act. Wherever there are goods and services changing hands and money is being made, government is eager to get a piece of the action. If cryptocurrencies continue to grow and position themselves as systems that are beyond the influence of banks and the reach of government regulation, we can be sure that governments will enact national laws and take their share of the proceeds. Many people believe that Bitcoin is going to replace the money we currently use, but we doubt it. That’s because big government will never allow it. Governments want the tax revenues, and they want control. Once governments begin to demand access to Bitcoin transaction records, especially those carried out with mainstream businesses, it is likely that regulations will follow. Once that happens, the black box will be opened and Bitcoin’s appeal as an underground tax avoidance scheme will be lost. Bitcoin’s fate is therefore highly unpredictable and dependent on what governments will do in the future. Once the crytocurrency was taken seriously by gamblers and techies, it became volatile, and that volatility is showing no signs of abating. What our research has shown is that with something as erratic as Bitcoin, with online chatter its main driving force rather than economic fundamentals, it would be best for investors to fasten their seatbelts and hold on tight.::2018-04-16T22:37:50Z::Bitcoin, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, Currencies, Foreign currency, Gold::Thanasis Stengos::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/214344/original/file-20180411-592-gl1ra9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
472::https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/15/bitcoin-fee-crash-could-lead-to-faster-miner-selling-analysts-say/::CoinDesk::article::Bitcoin Fee Crash Could Lead to Faster Miner Selling, Analysts Say::Bitcoin's mean transaction fee has reversed the post-halving Runes-led spike, squeezing miners' revenue.::Bitcoin (BTC) miners reduced their coin inventory before the reward halving took effect on April 19. The trend could soon resume as the blockchain has become cheaper to use, squeezing miners’ revenue. "Daily average network fees spiked after the halving, offsetting some pain for bitcoin miners. However, fees have since come down as the initial rush of users to the Runes protocol cooled off," analysts at Kaiko said in a weekly note titled "Reality Bites for Miners." "The recent decline in fees could lead to selling pressure from miners," analysts added. Bitcoin's price already face downside risks from long-defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt.Gox's impending $9 billion payout to its creditors, and a potential increase in selling pressure from miners may worsen the situation. Bitcoin miners earn revenue from two sources: block rewards and transaction fees. Miners receive a fixed amount of BTC as a reward for adding new blocks to the blockchain, along with transaction fees for including transactions in the blocks they mine. Last month's halving reduced the per-block coin emission to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC, putting the onus of compensating the negative impact on miner profitability on transaction fees and bitcoin's price. The mean transaction fee initially cooperated, surging from 0.0003 BTC to a six-year high of 0.00199 BTC immediately after halving, according to data tracked by Glassnode. The spike came as traders rushed to "etch" and mint tokens on top of the Bitcoin blockchain with the help of fungible token protocol Runes. However, the sugar rush from Runes was short-lived and the mean fee quickly tanked levels seen before halving. As of Tuesday, the mean transaction fee was 0.000039 BTC. Meanwhile, bitcoin's price has declined over 4% to $61,990 since halving, CoinDesk data show. "The higher fees had alleviated some of the post-halving stress on bitcoin miners, but they are beginning to feel the pressure of the slashed miner rewards," Kaiko said. "The halving has typically been a selling event for Bitcoin miners as the process of creating new blocks incurs significant costs, forcing miners to sell to cover costs." At press time, wallets associated with miners held 1.805 million BTC ($111.5 billion), according to Glassnode. Markus Thielen, head of 10x Research, expects miners to liquidate roughly $5 billion of BTC in the coming months. "Why would they keep inventory when the price is not going up," Thielen said, explaining his view. Crypto exchange Deribit made a similar observation on X, discussing an option strategy called "bear call spread" to navigate a potential miner-led drawdown in bitcoin's price. "Bitcoin forms lower highs and miners facing shrinking revenues and fees, are pressurized to sell their holdings. For traders looking to navigate this market, the Bear Call Spread strategy can be a suitable approach to consider," Deribit said. A bear call strategy is a two-legged option strategy taken when the view on the market is moderately bearish. Edited by Parikshit Mishra.

If the increase continues, it could reach a new all-time high.::We use cookies to improve your experience.  The BEAM price has fallen gradually since its all-time high of $0.027 on December 14, 2023. Despite the decrease, the price regained footing in 2024 and broke out from a long-term pattern. The daily time frame chart shows that the BEAM price created a bullish hammer candlestick on January 3 (green icon), when it had fallen to a low of $0.012. The price has increased since. After creating a higher low on January 14, BEAM accelerated its rate of increase, creating an ascending support trend line. Today, it is making its third bullish candlestick, breaking out from a horizontal resistance area that has been in place for nearly a month. The daily RSI is also turning bullish. The RSI is a momentum indicator traders use to evaluate whether a market is overbought or oversold and whether to accumulate or sell an asset. Readings above 50 and an upward trend suggest that bulls still have an advantage. Readings below 50 indicate the opposite. The indicator moved above 50 (green circle) during the bounce, indicating a bullish trend.

Altcoin Sherpa said that the altcoin is one of his biggest bets for 2024, and he believes it will go much higher. Godel noted the breakout from the long-term descending resistance trend line, stating that it can lead to much more upside in the future. He tweeted: Diagonal broken. S/R flip signaling more upside?

Technical analysts utilize the Elliott Wave theory to ascertain the trend’s direction by studying recurring long-term price patterns and investor psychology. The most likely wave count indicates that BEAM is in wave three in a five-wave increase (black). This is evident by the corrective A-B-C structure (white) inside wave two. The price action supports this bullish count for the altcoin, showing a breakout from a long-term symmetrical triangle and reclaiming the $0.022 horizontal area. Giving waves one and three a 1:1 ratio can trigger a 50% increase to the next resistance at $0.034. Despite this bullish BEAM price prediction, a close below $0.022 can cause a 20% decrease to the ascending support trend line at $0.018. For BeInCrypto’s latest crypto market analysis, click here.

Otherwise, small miners could be left with dormant ASICs, energy bills and little chance of breaking even. Read more: How the halving could impact bitcoin’s price Some at-home miners laid out the stakes in the r/BitcoinMining subreddit. “I personally need it at 70k for my operation to break even after halving,” one poster wrote. Another said BTC would need to reach $79,000 to break even, and $140,000 to recapture their current profit margin. “Mining isn’t really worth it these days and especially after the halving,” they wrote. There are other complicating factors besides price for DIY miners. One variable is Bitcoin’s hash rate, which has grown at an increasing rate throughout the network’s history. The hash rate is essentially a measure of the amount of competition to mine Bitcoin blocks. Elevated electricity prices where miners live can make things more difficult, particularly as power grids in the US and elsewhere buckle under demand for compute-intensive AI.

Many opt to join mining pools which coordinate and share rewards among several miners, while also charging varying fees. This is all besides the fact that the prices of miners vary, and more-efficient ASICs are released over time. At-home miners can punch these variables into online mining calculators to try measuring their chances of profit, but some have given up hope altogether. Several forum posters have encouraged prospective miners to gradually purchase bitcoin over time instead, a process known as dollar cost averaging. Two miners told Blockworks that using mining rigs for home heating was one avenue for making at-home mining profitable. ASIC miners emit heat as they run, and some Bitcoiners have developed means of capturing this heat and circulating it through their homes. Read more: Why most bitcoin mining stocks are down amid a persistent crypto rally “It makes one so much less price sensitive when you can mine AND eliminate a natural gas bill,” Canada-based at-home miner Antoine Desjardins, who produces heat from bitcoin mining, said in a direct message. Ndgo, a pseudonymous miner who has published calculations on at-home mining profitability to their X page, told Blockworks that miners need to make use of ASIC heat for at-home mining to make sense in the long run. But those already in the mining game likely won’t be deterred by the halving, ndgo added. “People have been planning for the halving, some since the last halving, many since last summer, [a] few since October-ish,” ndgo wrote. “Everybody knows it’s coming.

Through this innovative approach, independent blockchains can effectively collaborate and exchange information. It’s also designed to be fast and scalable. In recent years, numerous blockchain projects have shifted their focus towards improving general infrastructure rather than concentrating solely on specific applications. Polkadot is a standout example in this realm, regarded as one of the most successful projects dedicated to enhancing the fundamental technology behind decentralized applications (dApps). By prioritizing infrastructure-related improvements, it plays a vital role in advancing the underlying technology that powers dApps, contributing to the overall growth and development of the blockchain industry. The DOT token serves as the native cryptocurrency on the Polkadot network. As a governance token, it grants token holders the power to influence the decision-making process of the Polkadot protocol through voting. Additionally, the DOT token is utilized for transaction validation through a process called staking, and it plays a crucial role in bonding parachains—parallel blockchains that operate within the network. Through these various functions, the DOT token facilitates both the governance and technical aspects of the ecosystem. Polkadot presents a range of utilities that cater to diverse entities and individuals. It offers an alternative decentralized payment system that operates independently from intermediaries, granting individuals greater control over their finances. The DOT token also serves as a means for speculation and investment, providing an avenue for individuals to potentially benefit from its market dynamics. Moreover, it can serve as an alternative to costly and time-consuming international transfers, offering a more efficient solution. Furthermore, Polkadot’s infrastructure holds the potential to contribute to an alternative financial system for the significant number of individuals worldwide who possess smartphones but lack access to traditional banking services. This presents an opportunity for income generation or supplementation through DOT staking, allowing users to participate in securing and validating transactions on the network while potentially earning rewards. Overall, Polkadot and the DOT token bring forth various opportunities and benefits for individuals across different contexts. It was established in 2016 by a team of founders that included Gavin Wood, who is recognized as a co-founder of Ethereum. Alongside co-founders Peter Czaban and Robert Habermeier, Gavin Wood played a pivotal role in the creation. Gavin Wood’s background is particularly noteworthy, as he is the inventor of Solidity, the programming language widely used by developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum blockchain. Prior to co-founding Polkadot, Wood served as the first Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of the Ethereum Foundation. He also brings experience as a research scientist at Microsoft, further enhancing his expertise in the blockchain and technology domains. Polkadot’s original whitepaper was published in 2016, setting the foundation for the project. Subsequently, in 2017, Polkadot successfully raised $145 million through a fundraising effort. After careful development and preparations, Polkadot’s initial mainnet was launched in May 2020. During the initial Proof-of-Authority (PoA) phase, the Web3 Foundation took charge of network governance, ensuring the smooth operation of the protocol. As the network gained momentum, Validators began joining the network to participate in the consensus mechanism. In June, Polkadot transitioned to the second phase called Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS). By this stage, the network had achieved a significant number of decentralized Validators. This phase marked a crucial milestone in the evolution of Polkadot, as it solidified the network’s consensus mechanism and increased its decentralization. Related: What is Cardano (Ada)? Is it a good investment in 2023? Please note that the following statement is our opinion and should not be considered financial advice. Dot has a bright future in light of its limited token supply and practical application. Although in recent years, the price of DOT is gradually decreasing. And in our opinion, we should not expect any changes in the near future. Most experts see the DOT price around $100 by 2030.

477::https://theconversation.com/quest-to-find-bitcoins-founder-highlights-currencys-biggest-threat-the-taxman-52411::The Conversation::article::Quest to find bitcoin’s founder highlights currency’s biggest threat: the taxman::How tax authorities decide to treat virtual currencies like bitcoin may determine whether they thrive or die.::Bitcoin enthusiasts have recently been roiled by claims that an Australian named Craig Wright and his deceased partner are the mysterious founders behind the cryptocurrency. Of course, we’ve been down this path before. The New York Times, Fast Company, The New Yorker and Newsweek have all made similar claims about different people, only to be proved wrong. And last month, Wired – the magazine behind the most recent claim – said there are reasons to believe Wright is actually a hoaxer and not “Satoshi Nakamoto,” as the currency’s creator is known. Regardless of whether the new claims are correct, it has resurrected a worry that has long plagued bitcoin users. Around one million bitcoins were mined early in the currency’s history and have never been transferred. Were they to be sold en masse, bitcoin’s value could drop precipitously, wiping out a lot of wealth and threatening its status as a reliable alternate currency, independent of banks and governments. However, the reporting about Wright and the bitcoin businesses and trusts he has established – presumably for tax and secrecy purposes – reveals an even bigger threat to bitcoin users and other supporters of virtual currency: how will such currencies be treated for tax purposes? This is a question I have been exploring for the last decade, both with regard to virtual currencies designed to be used solely online, such as for World of Warcraft, and those designed for use in the real world, such as bitcoin. Bitcoins are created by a computer algorithm and are initially allocated through a process colloquially referred to as “mining.” Miners collect bitcoins by solving complex mathematical equations used to authenticate transfers and in so doing both bring more of the currency into the world and maintain the system. Bitcoin users have a public key and a private key associated with the bitcoins they own. To effect a transfer, one must use the private key. However, transfers are recorded on a public “block chain,” which uses the associated public key. This secure public record-keeping obviates the need for third-party intermediaries, like banks. While the world can see the public key and how many bitcoins are associated with it, the owner of the bitcoin can remain anonymous if he keeps his association with that key secret. Approximately 15 million bitcoins have been issued to date, and they are currently valued at about US$430 each, for a total of approximately $6.5 billion. The algorithm is designed to generate 21 million bitcoins, and experts anticipate that the last bitcoin will be issued sometime between 2110 and 2140. Bitcoin is designed to be used as a currency, though some hold it as an investment. The difficulty is that governments have taken a variety of positions on the nature of bitcoin for tax purposes. For instance, some countries, including those in Europe, have classified bitcoin as a currency for consumption tax purposes, meaning that the various value-added taxes do not apply to bitcoin exchanges, while others, such as Australia, have not. Similarly, the U.K. treats bitcoin as foreign currency for income tax purposes, while the U.S. regards it as property. Those who “mine” bitcoins will likely be subject to income tax on the value they receive under the theory that they are being compensated for validating bitcoin transactions and maintaining the block chain that records all transfers. But this is true regardless of whether bitcoin is recognized as a currency. In other words, they are not really mining and not subject to the complex rules governing mining operations. Instead, they are being compensated for services. The difficulty arises when people try to spend their bitcoins, however acquired. Those who spend local currency, such as dollars (U.S. or Australian) or euros, do not report a gain or loss when they do so. For instance, if I buy a hamburger, I don’t have a gain or loss on the currency used, regardless of whether it has changed value relative to other currencies. As the baseline currency, a dollar is worth a dollar, even though it may fluctuate against other currencies or be affected by inflation. Foreign currency is different. If I buy a euro for $1 and spend it later, when it is worth $1.10, theoretically I have a $0.10 gain that I should be taxed on. Different countries have different rules, but in the U.S., taxpayers need not pay taxes on such gains if they are under $200 in a given year. By refusing to classify bitcoin as a currency for income tax purposes (local or otherwise), tax authorities effectively treat bitcoins as any other property, meaning that those who buy items with bitcoins must report any gain on the transaction associated with a change in its value. That is, it is treated like an investment, regardless of how the owner actually uses it. It is as if they sold their bitcoins for cash and then used that cash to make a purchase. Worse yet, if the bitcoin has gone down in value, taxpayers might not be able to deduct the losses, because they could be considered personal. Thus, anyone using bitcoin as a currency has to keep track of each bitcoin’s cost so that he can accurately calculate gain or loss. This administrative task, combined with the potential need to pay income taxes, could make bitcoin too difficult to use as an alternate currency. Wright’s tale of woe with the Australia Tax Authority (ATA) (revealed in a transcript made public as part of the effort to prove that he is Satoshi Nakamoto) shows how the decision not to classify bitcoin as a currency creates problems with a tax on goods and services (GST). Among other things, Wright sought to create an exchange to buy and sell bitcoin. If bitcoin were considered a currency, such exchanges would be exempt from the GST, and the exchange could operate economically. However, if the GST applied to such transactions, as the ATA claimed, the exchange would be forced to purchase $1 of bitcoin for $1.10 (assuming a 10% rate). In other words, if you use normal currency, it would cost you $1, but if you use bitcoin, it would cost $1.10. Bitcoin becomes a lot less attractive under those conditions. To avoid this result, Wright and his lawyers established a number of offshore trusts and argued that, for many of the transactions the ATA was investigating, no bitcoin was actually transferred. Instead, the beneficial interests in the trusts, which were not subject to the GST, were transferred. The bitcoin itself was purportedly held offshore, and any transfer of the bitcoin or rights to it were outside the reach of the ATA. It’s not clear whether such arguments would actually succeed, but they illustrate a real problem that intangible assets raise for both consumption and income taxes, especially for countries that use a territorial tax system (that is, one that doesn’t tax foreign income). If assets are considered to be outside a given country, they will not be subject to that country’s GST or equivalent tax. Moreover, if the asset can be “wrapped” in a trust or other entity whose ownership interests are exempt from the GST, it can potentially escape tax even if it is held locally. Similarly, if such assets generate income, for instance when they are bought or sold, under a territorial system, that income will be taxed in the country where the sale occurred. It is not surprising that Wright established at least some of his trusts in known tax havens, such as the Seychelles. Even if his efforts to shield bitcoin from tax through these efforts succeed, they are far too complicated for the average user and will likely further impede bitcoin’s adoption as an alternate currency. Much of the recent focus has been on whether Wright really created bitcoin and whether he is sitting on a hoard worth close to a half billion dollars, which could potentially destabilize the market. However, the real threat to bitcoin and other similar products may come from a far more mundane source: the world’s tax authorities. Absent favorable rulings, every bitcoin transaction could generate both income and consumption tax liability, rendering bitcoin impractical as an alternate currency. Sophisticated tax planning to avoid such outcomes might succeed but would make bitcoin harder to use. Thus, while bitcoin was developed as a means to free individuals from the need to interact with third parties, including the government, it nonetheless needs governmental cooperation if it is to move from the fringes to the mainstream.::2016-01-07T11:16:19Z::Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, Currencies, Global economy , Online currencies, Satoshi Nakamoto, Tax, Taxation, Virtual currencies::Adam Chodorow::Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/107461/original/image-20160106-14944-1b6iyfi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C177%2C1500%2C727&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day. Bitcoin made some cautious gains on Wednesday ahead of the latest inflation data from the U.S. BTC is priced at $62,775 at the time of writing, up 1.8% in 24 hours. The wider digital market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), also ticked up, adding 0.55%. April's U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data is due at 08:30 ET, with expectations that it will show a 3.4% year-on-year increase, slower than March's 3.5%. Some analysts expect a softer-than-expected CPI reading could lift bitcoin above $65,000. Latest News: U.S. CPI Softer Than Expected at 0.3% in April; Bitcoin Rises to $63.7K Bitcoin's mean transaction fee has reversed the post-halving spike, squeezing miners' revenue. Miners earn revenue from two sources: block rewards and transaction fees. Miners receive a fixed amount of BTC as a reward for adding new blocks, along with transaction fees for including transactions in the blocks they mine. The spike, driven by the new Runes protocol, helped to compensate for the block reward being cut in half, but this proved to be short-lived. In response, miners may liquidate around $5 billion worth of BTC in the coming months, according to Markus Thielen, head of 10x Research. "Why would they keep inventory when the price is not going up?" Thielen said. Broker Canaccord Genuity expects Galaxy Digital's positive momentum to continue after the crypto financial services firm reported an increase in net income of 40% on Tuesday. Galaxy saw an increase in the number of trading counterparties with trading revenue rising 79%, Canaccord noted in a report, citing the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. as the major catalyst. Mike Novogratz’s firm also increased its proprietary mining hashrate and the Helios facility “presents an opportunity for Galaxy to pursue both mining and AI hosting over time,” the broker said. Galaxy's Toronto-listed shares fell 1.12% on Tuesday to close at C$12.41. - Omkar Godbole Edited by Sheldon Reback.

It all depends on...::Bitcoin’s price can head in so many different directions as the year goes on. It all depends on…  Bitcoin recorded a notable hike recently, with gains of 4.9% seen over the past week. This uptick has contributed to a broader bullish trend across the cryptocurrency market. Analysts are now closely monitoring various indicators to predict what might lie ahead for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. One such analyst, Willy Woo, shared his insights on the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) Oscillator for Bitcoin, discussing its potential implications for future market movements. Woo’s analysis on the social media platform X delved into the VWAP, a technical indicator that averages the price of an asset while considering the volume of transactions at each price level. This approach gives more importance to price levels with higher trading volumes, providing a more balanced view of price movements.  For Bitcoin, Woo specifically examined the VWAP using on-chain volume, which benefits from the transparency of the blockchain to provide clear data to all observers. The focus of Woo’s study is the VWAP Oscillator, which measures the ratio between Bitcoin’s spot price and its VWAP, displaying this relationship in a form that oscillates around zero. Source: Willy Woo on X Recent trends revealed that the VWAP Oscillator has been in negative territory for the past few months, but is now on an upward trajectory. Should this continue, it could soon reach the neutral zone, signaling a potential shift in market dynamics. Historical data also seemed to indicate that when the VWAP Oscillator exits the negative zone and starts to climb, it often precedes a period of bullish momentum for Bitcoin. The price typically continues to surge until the oscillator peaks in positive territory and begins to decline. According to Woo, this pattern means that “there is still a lot of room to run before a reversal or consolidation occurs,” making it a challenging time for bearish investors in the market. Further supplementing these bullish observations, a CryptoQuant analyst also highlighted an increasing number of purchases from retail investors. According to the analyst, they have now bought roughly $135.7 million worth of Bitcoin over the past month alone. Source: CryptoQuant This buying spree aligns with a spike in Bitcoin’s daily active addresses, as shown by Santiment’s data. The number of daily active addresses surged from approximately 49,000 to over 66,000 in a single day, illustrating a significant hike in market activity. Source: Santiment From a technical analysis perspective too, Bitcoin’s chart on the 4-hour timeframe showed some promising signs. The appearance of a bullish abandoned baby pattern followed by a bullish engulfing candlestick that closes above its predecessor is a particularly positive bullish signal. Source: BTC/USDT, TradingView These technical patterns align with Woo’s prediction, indicating that Bitcoin might be gearing up for more gains. Notably, one of the catalysts behind BTC’s current bullishness is the release of the latest CPI data which was slightly lower than the expected 0.4%, as previously reported by AMBCrypto.

In cryptocurrency, coins are digital assets native to a blockchain. Put another way, they are assets built into the blockchain itself rather than on top of the blockchain. We can think of this in terms of nations. The native currency for the United States is the United States Dollar (USD), the British Pound Sterling (GBP) for the United Kingdom, and the Euro (EURO) for the Eurozone. Similarly, the native cryptocurrency for the Bitcoin blockchain is Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) for Ethereum, and Solana (SOL) for the Solana blockchain. Let’s take this further. The U.S. Department of the Treasury issues seven denominations of paper currency ($1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100) and five denominations of coins (1¢, 5¢, 10¢, 25¢, 50¢). In the same way, cryptocurrency coins have several denominations as well. There are two popular methods for creating a blockchain’s native coins — UTXO (unspent transaction output) and the account model. While cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Litecoin use the UTXO model, other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and the BNB chain use the account model. A UTXO is created when a transaction occurs. When miners mine a block, they make a Coinbase or a transaction to pay themselves for updating the blockchain. A coinbase transaction is the first transaction in a block a miner creates. When a transaction output is created, it becomes a UTXO until it is spent. Each UTXO contains information about its value (e.g., how many coins it represents). Once created, the outputs can only be used once as input in a new transaction. Two types of record-keeping models are popular in today’s blockchain networks. The first method is the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) Model and the second one is the Account/Balance Model. The UTXO model is employed by Bitcoin, and Ethereum uses the Account/Balance Model. pic.twitter.com/HEEzlMViVF This is similar to a transaction made in coins or bills. A UTXO is like a coin or bill itself, while the bill’s value can vary, similar to how the value of a UTXO can vary. Once spent, you can not retrieve the bill you used to pay once, just like UTXOs can only be used once. The buyer receives any change left over from the transaction. Another UTXO is created and sent to the recipient when a UTXO is spent. If the original UTXO exceeds the amount sent, a second UTXO is made, and the sender receives the remainder via a change address. Each UTXO must reference a previous UTXO as its input, except for special cases like coinbase transactions where new coins are minted. This creates a chain of custody from one UTXO to another based on the history of transactions. You can trace a UTXO back to the transaction where it was created as an output. While the UTXO model records transactions in a way that is similar to transacting with bills and coins, the account model is similar to traditional banking. In this model, accounts hold balances that increase or decrease with each transaction. When you send a transaction, the blockchain directly adjusts the accounts’ balances. It also debits the amount from the sender’s account and credits the same amount to the recipient. As a result, the coins technically are not “sent.” Rather, there is a ledger that updates with each transaction. Another important detail to keep in mind is the account nonce. The account nonce is simply an index of the number of successful transactions of a single account. It ensures that transactions from a single account are processed in the order they are sent. This is important for maintaining the state consistency of the account, such as the balance of Ether. The term nonce (number used once) is used quite frequently in crypto and tech-related fields. “Account nonces” have a separate purpose from nonces in blockchain mining, message authentication codes (MAC), and other systems. Blockchains are distributed databases requiring a network of nodes to maintain all the data it stores. The nodes are computers or servers maintained by individuals or organizations. However, keeping these databases comes at a cost. Unlike Amazon Web Service or Microsoft Azure, the database (or blockchain) nodes are anonymous and distributed globally. Therefore, paying these node operators for their work in a fiat currency is impossible. When a block is created, the node that mines or proposes the block receives a coinbase or a stipend for maintaining this distributed database. Another reason that coins exist is to pay gas and transaction fees. When you create a transaction on a blockchain, a node must pick up your transaction and expend resources to execute it. A transaction fee is paid to the miner or proposer (validator) that executes the transaction. Alternatively, gas fees are the cost to execute the transaction, and transaction fees are the cost to pay the miner or validator to execute the transaction. Users pay both transaction and gas fees in coins. 1. Bitcoin (BTC): Created by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency. While Bitcoin was designed as a medium of exchange, it has since found a stronger use as a store of value. 2. Ether (ETH): Ether is the native cryptocurrency to the Ethereum blockchain. It is used as gas for the Ethereum virtual machine, which allows developers to create applications with some level of complexity. 3. Solana (SOL): As the native coin of the Solana network, SOL is used as payment for gas and transaction fees — which are extremely low on Solana. The smallest unit of SOL is a Lamport, named after Leslie Lamport. 4. Avalanche (AVAX): Avalanche is a layer-0 protocol that uses the AVAX coin as its native crypto. On Avalanche, users can launch subnets using their own nodes. 5. Cosmos (ATOM): Cosmos is a hub allowing founders to create blockchains using the IBC. This enables blockchains to communicate, share information, and transfer assets like ATOM securely and standardized. Unlike coins, developers do not build cryptocurrency tokens directly into the blockchain. Instead, they create tokens as cryptocurrencies using smart contracts on a blockchain. The logic for what “qualifies” as a token and governs its behavior depends entirely on the developer that creates it. With most blockchains today, the network does not recognize the tokens built on it. A few blockchains like Sui and Aptos offer rare exceptions to this rule. As such, some communities have developed token standards specific to their blockchain ecosystem. Token standards govern how accounts are updated. Some of the logic that they manage includes: Perhaps the most popular token standard is the ERC-20 standard for the Ethereum ecosystem and EVM-compatible chains. There is also the BEP-20 standard for the BNB chain, SPL (Solana Program Library) for Solana, and, more recently, the BRC-20 standard for Bitcoin. The concept of tokens is not specific to cryptocurrency. Many examples of tokens exist in the real world. In this case, a token is just a physical representation of some right or privilege. For example, you could consider the deed to a house or the title to a car as a token or proof of ownership of those assets. Tokenization is the digital representation of rights and privileges. In the case of tokens created by smart contracts, the token represents the right to transact value. Aside from the standard logic, tokens work in many different ways. Founders typically create tokens with a purpose in mind and will tailor their behavior to the decentralized application (DApp) or ecosystem in which it will operate. Many have attempted to create frameworks for classifying token logic. This is quite the herculean feat, considering that they are as diverse as the developer is imaginative. In the case of ERC-20 tokens, the logic for the token exists completely within the smart contract. So technically, addresses on Ethereum do not actually “hold” tokens. Rather, the smart contract is like a ledger for an accountant. It keeps a record of the balances of each address that owns tokens. When someone “sends” tokens to another address, the smart contract updates the balance of both addresses. That is why it is important to create tokens using well-tested standards and best practices. Unless developers are careful, a hacker could game poorly formed token logic. As stated previously, many have attempted to create standards for classifying tokens. This is difficult, considering tokens gain new use cases every year. The most popular uses for tokens are: 1. Chainlink (LINK): Chainlink is most notably known for its blockchain-agnostic oracle services. The team behind Chainlink also creates infrastructure for cross-chain communication, bridging, verifiable randomness, and more. 2. The Graph (GRT): Often described as the Google of web3, The Graph is a protocol for indexing information stored on the blockchain. It allows users to query, publish, and use public data to build applications. GRT: The Graph: The Graph is a decentralized protocol that allows developers to index, query, and access blockchain data in a scalable and efficient manner. $PIXIZ | $BAMA | #Bitbama | #R2E. 3. Render (RNDR): Render is a project that allows users to transact in a GPU marketplace. Sellers can rent out their GPU power while buyers utilize it for graphic rendering tasks. 4. Uniswap (UNI): Uniswap is Ethereum’s most popular decentralized exchange (DEX). The UNI token gives its holders governance rights over the protocol. 5. Gala (GALA): Gala Games is a blockchain-based gaming platform that lets players own, develop, and trade in-game assets with cryptocurrency. Here’s a comparison chart that outlines the key differences between crypto coins and tokens. This chart helps to delineate the differences between crypto coins and tokens, portraying how they are used, where they operate, and their characteristics in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. You can compare coins and tokens to currency in traditional finance (TradFi) in many ways. From an accounting perspective, the ledger that records and issues the currency is centralized in trades, decentralized with coins, and depends on tokens. In traditional finance, there are different forms of money because of the system’s complexity. For example, USD can come in bank deposits, fiat (e.g., bills and coins), treasuries (e.g., bonds, notes, etc.), and central bank notes. “When most people think of money, they picture rectangular pieces of government-printed paper, known as fiat currency, decorated with historical figures. Although it is the most well-known form of money, it is only a small part of what constitutes money in the modern financial system.” This complexity complicates the ledger; however, at the end of the day, the system is mostly centralized under the U.S. government. On the other hand, coins built on blockchains are part of a decentralized ledger that is maintained by a global community. In the case of USD, the U.S. government can sanction any country to prevent it from using dollars. With a blockchain, anyone has the right to update the ledger (mint more coins), but no one can exclude anyone else from doing so or transacting. However, tokens do not necessarily have this ability. It all depends on the smart contract itself. Despite the name, stablecoins are primarily tokens. Developers create stablecoins on vetted and seasoned blockchains. This makes them tokens. The reason is that mature blockchains already have the infrastructure for users to utilize stablecoins. If stablecoin providers had to build their blockchains to issue coins, they would also have to find a way to attract developers to build apps on their blockchain or the applications themselves. Both of these options are extremely costly. There could also be significant ramifications if these providers built their own blockchains and bridged the stablecoins to other ecosystems. This comparison between crypto coins and tokens highlights substantial differences between asset types. You must thoroughly research and understand these distinctions for safe trading practices. Staying well-informed will empower you to navigate the cryptocurrency sector safely and effectively. Coins are cryptocurrencies that have their blockchain. Tokens are built on blockchains but do not have their own. They are simply smart contracts that exist outside of the source code of a blockchain. Ethereum is a blockchain. The native coin of Ethereum is Ether. Though many cryptocurrencies exist on Ethereum, their logic is not built into the source code of Ethereum. Tokens are useful for utilizing services on decentralized applications (DApps). For example, traders can not use native Ether in many applications on Ethereum. They must use Wrapped Ether (WETH), a tokenized (smart contract) version of Ether. There are many different classifications for tokens. Utility, governance, security, non-fungible, and transactional are the most common. Tokens are often difficult to classify because their uses and purposes grow with time. Tokens are not a phenomenon specific to cryptocurrency. They also exist in the traditional world. For example, a deed to a house or car title could be considered a token. Examples of tokens include Chainlink (LINK), the Graph (GRT), and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Nearly all stablecoins and most meme coins are also tokens, except Dogecoin. Cryptocurrencies like ETH, BTC, and AVAX are not tokens because their logic is built into the blockchain. However, wrapped versions of these tokens (e.g., WETH, WBTC, and WAVAX) are considered tokens.

481::https://blockworks.co/news/blockchains-still-arent-great-at-communication::Blockworks::article::Blockchains still aren’t great at communication::Opinion: The current state of blockchain interoperability poses an existential threat to the mainstream adoption of blockchain as a whole.::The current state of blockchain interoperability poses an existential threat to the mainstream adoption of blockchain technology as a whole Midjourney modified by Blockworks One of the prerequisites for the mass adoption of blockchain technology is interoperability — the ability to pass data between distinct blockchain and blockchain-like systems. Numerous interoperability projects have established themselves today, and many are growing at an incredible rate. Indeed, it’s only a matter of time before the number of cross-chain messages is measured in trillions. Blockchain interoperability has never been more ubiquitous. In January 2024, more than $23 billion worth of assets were locked in cross-chain bridges on Ethereum alone. Clearly, our industry’s early adopters — affectionately called Web3 enthusiasts — are keen to explore new ecosystems as they routinely bridge assets from one blockchain to another. This process, though clunky, has become so commonplace that many believe that blockchain interoperability is a solved issue. The truth is far more bleak. The state of blockchain interoperability today is one of fractured incompatibility. Competing interoperability projects build ad hoc solutions that gerrymander the blockchain landscape, making it impractical for enterprises and regulators to vet the security of each. As it stands, the current state of blockchain interoperability poses an existential threat to the mainstream adoption of blockchain technology as a whole. Modern interoperability projects are far too focused on building and growing their own proprietary products. The fight to become the one-and-only has introduced growing system complexity and, therefore, unbounded risk. As different projects make different tradeoffs to solve different problems, blockchain interoperability protocols continue to increase in complexity. Not only does this complexity make protocols progressively more incompatible with one another, each new system component or trust assumption introduces new attack vectors. As an industry, we must curb this troubling trend. A shared framework for interoperability is desperately needed. As a trustless system, decentralized blockchains are incapable of communicating with other blockchain networks out-of-the-box. Trust assumptions dictate the risk profile of a particular cross-chain design by shaping its vulnerabilities and delineating how a system can be exploited. Generally speaking, the greater the complexity of a system, the higher its susceptibility to attack. It is therefore preferable to simplify the design of cross-chain solutions in order to limit the number of exploitable components. So, while it is true that trust assumptions are inherent to blockchain interoperability solutions, there is security in simplicity. Read more from our opinion section: There’s no reason to fear open platforms A shared framework for interoperability between blockchain and blockchain-like systems — one that includes architectural guidelines and vetted interface definitions — makes it possible to reduce system complexity. This has the knock-on effect of preventing fragmentation across different project implementations. Even something as simple as common interfaces and functions to decode and verify the validity of messages would go a long way towards enhancing interoperability, while reducing the need for custom implementations. A shared framework for interoperability also has the potential to foster collaboration between different interoperability projects. Broadly speaking, interoperability projects simply don’t trust each others’ work. This isn’t entirely surprising considering that, between 2021 and 2023, more than $2.9 billion was stolen from exploited cross-chain bridges. Nevertheless, this distrust has directly contributed to the fractured state of blockchain interoperability today. A shared framework, built openly and vetted by all, will result in a more secure system. Blockchain interoperability must be core infrastructure first, product second. If we as an industry are to have any hope of achieving the mainstream adoption of blockchain technology (without sacrificing the industry’s core ethos of decentralization), we must establish a shared framework for interoperability.

484::https://theconversation.com/demystifying-the-blockchain-a-basic-user-guide-60226::The Conversation::article::Demystifying the blockchain: a basic user guide::Multiple use cases for the blockchain are currently being tested, so it’s worth learning the basics.::Companies around the world are exploring blockchain, the technology underpinning digital currency bitcoin. In this Blockchain unleashed series, we investigate the many possible use cases for the blockchain, from the novel to the transformative. Most people agree we do not need to know how a television works to enjoy using one. This is true of many existing and emerging technologies. Most of us happily drive cars, use mobile phones and send emails without knowing how they work. With this in mind, here is a tech-free user guide to the blockchain - the technology infrastructure behind bitcoin, and many other emerging platforms. What does the blockchain do? The blockchain is software that stores and transfers value or data across the internet. What can I store and transfer using the blockchain? To use the blockchain, you will need to set up an account or address (a virtual wallet). At this time, the most popular use for the blockchain is to make micro-payments with virtual currencies. For example, you can buy bitcoin with real money and then spend it on the internet using the blockchain. Authorising a payment using the blockchain is similar to using a credit card to buy something online. Instead of a 16-digit credit card number, you provide the vendor with a unique string of numbers and letters generated for each transaction. With this unique identifier, the blockchain can verify and authenticate the transaction. Can I use the blockchain to transfer real money? Not yet. Some companies are using the blockchain to make international financial transfers, but most of these transactions are enabled by bitcoin or other digital currencies. Exchanging real money for bitcoin incurs fees for the sender, but the benefit is speed, security and convenience. How is transferring value or virtual currency on the blockchain different from transferring money from my bank account? Depending on the amount and the destination, when you transfer money from your bank account, your bank will limit the amount you can transfer. Most banks impose daily limits for all transactions. When you use virtual money on the blockchain, there are no limits. When you transfer value or currency from your bank account to an account with a different bank or other financial institution, the transfer can take days. When you use the blockchain, the transfer is immediate. If a transfer from your bank account puts your account into debit, your bank will charge you a fee. The blockchain will not allow a transfer in excess of your balance and so your virtual wallet will never be in debit. How is storing value using the blockchain different from keeping my money in a bank account? Bank accounts and credit cards are vulnerable to attack from fraudsters and hackers. The blockchain is a more secure way to store and transfer funds, particularly if you keep a modest value in your virtual wallet. Hacking the blockchain is difficult, time-consuming and expensive. No one breaks into Fort Knox for just $500. Of course, value stored on the blockchain will not earn you interest or improve your credit rating; and the blockchain will not lend you money to buy a house or car. The blockchain does not replace your bank, but very soon banks will be using the blockchain too. How is transferring data using the blockchain different to attaching a file to an email? Unlike emails with attachments, the blockchain enables the immediate transfer of data no matter how big the file. Also, there is less danger of spam or viruses and no need for firewalls or junk folders. How is storing data using the blockchain different to storing my files on my computer? If you lose or break your computer or if it is attacked by a hacker or virus, you could lose that data. The blockchain resides in the cloud. Like any web-based storage, you just need your username and password to access your data from anywhere anytime. What else can I use the blockchain for? Very soon the blockchain will be used for online transactions. It will enable smart contracts, crowdfunding and auctions. It will verify the provenance of artworks and diamonds; transfer title to real estate and other assets; and store information about people, products and property. Apps for music distribution, sports betting and a new type of financial auditing are also being tested. Why is the blockchain described as “riskless”? The blockchain verifies and authenticates both ends of each transaction. It will not release a purchaser’s funds until it has checked that the vendor will deliver as promised. Is the blockchain safe? Standards and regulations are needed so that the technology can be readily used across different organisations, industries and jurisdictions. Blockchains can be private (like an email) or public (like Facebook), so users need to know which type is being operated before joining a new blockchain. My tips for safe use of the blockchain are: keep your virtual wallet details secure; do not let an unknown third party hold virtual currency or data for you; and do not provide your online banking details to anyone. As seen in a recent attack on a crowdfunding project, the blockchain is at its most vulnerable when significant value is stored in a single address. The blockchain may be trustworthy, but the people on it might not be.::2016-07-12T19:45:43Z::Banking, Bitcoin, Blockchain, Blockchain unleashed, Crowdfunding, Cryptocurrency, Smart contract::Philippa Ryan::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/124654/original/image-20160531-1923-4sw0cj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=13%2C10%2C986%2C479&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

Now, the landscape of stablecoins is evolving, with innovative projects emerging that look beyond conventional USD pegs. These new stablecoins are tethered to alternative assets like commodities, real estate, or even diversified baskets of cryptocurrencies, introducing a fresh perspective on stability and risk management within the digital asset domain. While USD-pegged stablecoins like tether (USDT) and USDC dominate the market, they are subject to the fluctuations and vulnerabilities of the U.S. dollar. In contrast, stablecoins tied to alternative assets offer diversification benefits and reduced exposure to currency risk. Commodity-backed stablecoins, for example, are pegged to the value of underlying commodities such as gold, silver, or oil, providing intrinsic value and hedging against inflationary pressures.

Real estate-backed stablecoins leverage the stability and appreciation potential of tangible assets, allowing investors to access fractional ownership in properties worldwide. These stablecoins are backed by real estate portfolios, offering liquidity and diversification in an asset class traditionally characterized by illiquidity and high barriers to entry. Another groundbreaking approach is stablecoins tied to a basket of cryptocurrencies, like DAI and wrapped bitcoin, offer stability while capturing the potential upside of the digital asset market. These diversified stablecoins mitigate single-currency risk and provide exposure to a broader spectrum of cryptocurrencies, reducing volatility and enhancing portfolio resilience. The emergence of stablecoins beyond USD pegs reflects a maturing market and growing investor demand for stability, transparency, and diversification in digital assets. These alternative stablecoins offer a compelling value proposition for investors seeking to preserve capital and navigate the dynamic cryptocurrency landscape with confidence. In emerging markets, for example, with unstable local currencies, stablecoins provide a reliable alternative to traditional dollars, facilitating cross-border transactions and financial inclusion. Not all stablecoins, however, deliver on their promise of stability and liquidity. In mid-2022, TerraUSD was de-pegged, losing its value, simultaneously crashing the price of its sister coin, Luna. In a matter of days, both coins quickly became worthless, wiping billions of dollars off the cryptocurrency markets. Despite their potential benefits, alternative stablecoins face regulatory scrutiny, liquidity challenges, and valuation complexities. Regulatory frameworks governing commodity-backed stablecoins and real estate-backed stablecoins vary across jurisdictions, requiring robust compliance measures and legal frameworks to ensure investor protection and compliance. Moreover, the liquidity of alternative stablecoins may be limited compared to USD-pegged stablecoins, posing challenges for trading and market adoption. Valuation methodologies for alternative assets can also be complex and opaque, requiring transparency and independent audits to instill investor trust and confidence. In conclusion, stablecoin innovations beyond USD pegs represent a significant paradigm shift in the cryptocurrency market, offering investors new avenues for stability, diversification, and risk management. While challenges remain, the growing adoption and maturation of alternative stablecoins signal a transformative shift toward a more resilient and inclusive digital asset ecosystem.

487::https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-halving-effect-on-microstrategy-stock::Blockworks::article::What analysts say the Bitcoin halving is set to do for MicroStrategy stock::One analyst nearly doubled his price target for MicroStrategy stock on Monday as industry watchers anticipate upward price action.::The publicly traded hoarder of bitcoin could hold close to 300,000 BTC by the end of 2025, the Benchmark Company’s Mark Palmer predicts Wirestock Creators/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks One analyst nearly doubled his price target for MicroStrategy stock on Monday as industry watchers anticipate upward price action in the months after the imminent Bitcoin halving. Mark Palmer, a senior equity research analyst for The Benchmark Company, said in a Monday research note that he had raised his price target for MicroStrategy (MSTR) to $1,875 per share. The new mark is nearly double that of his $990 price target set for MSTR on Feb. 27. Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to an all-time high above $69,000 about a week later, and would reach new heights after that. MicroStrategy’s stock price stood at $1,538 at 12:30 pm ET Monday — up 125% year to date and 8% higher than a month ago. The $1,875 price target assumes bitcoin’s price rising to $150,000 by the end of 2025, Palmer wrote in the note. It stands above a $1,450 MicroStrategy price target made by TD Cowen analysts on March 20, a target that has not been revised since. Read more: Cheatsheet: MicroStrategy has now outperformed Nvidia this year The Bitcoin halving — when per-block rewards to bitcoin miners will drop from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC — is scheduled to occur in less than two weeks. While the upcoming Bitcoin halving, like previous ones, is set to create a “supply shock,” the impact of this halving could be magnified given the demand for spot bitcoin ETFs, Palmer added. The 11 US spot bitcoin ETFs held roughly 827,000 BTC as of April 3, according to BitMEX Research data. The fund category has notched net inflows of more than $12 billion since such offerings launched on Jan. 11. “We expect the inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs to grow dramatically once institutions begin to invest in them in earnest,” Palmer wrote. Industry watchers have pointed to the historical upward trend of BTC after Bitcoin halvings. Read more: BTC price dips after all-time high. Where is it headed next? Analysts at crypto exchange Bitfinex said in a Monday report that they — similar to Palmer — expect bitcoin to see a 160% post-halving price surge to above $150,000 in the next 14 months. The Bitfinex analysts noted, however, that bitcoin achieving an all-time high ahead of this halving is an anomaly that “introduces a level of uncertainty into the market dynamics.” “If the price of bitcoin rises after the halving, we would expect MicroStrategy to remain correlated with that price action,” said Dan Weiskopf, co-portfolio manager of the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK). MicroStrategy has increased its bitcoin holdings for 15 consecutive quarters, Palmer noted. He expects the company to continue collecting BTC using proceeds from capital markets transactions and excess cash generated by its enterprise software business. The company held 214,246 BTC as of March 19. It most recently bought more than 9,000 BTC last month after proposing an offering of $500 million in convertible senior notes due in 2031. Read more: Who’s the better bitcoin salesman: Larry Fink or Michael Saylor? Palmer said he estimates that MicroStrategy will hold 298,246 bitcoin by the end of 2025. This would represent a nearly 40% increase from its current bitcoin stack. Lance Vitanza, managing director of equity research at TD Cowen, told Blockworks last year that he expects MicroStrategy to continue buying BTC when market conditions are attractive — based on BTC price and the price at which MicroStrategy can issue debt or equity securities. Vitanza said in a March 20 research note that, given a $1.25 billion valuation of MicroStrategy’s operating software business, the market was imputing a 90% premium to the value of the company’s bitcoin holdings. “Ultimately, we expect that any future contraction in the company’s bitcoin premium will over time be more than offset by a corresponding increase in the underlying price of bitcoin, as the seasoning of new ETPs continues to drive incremental bitcoin demand at the same time incremental supply of bitcoin falls by 50% due the halving of the bitcoin block reward expected this coming April,” Vitanza wrote at the time. The premium valuation that the stock trades at presents an advantage for the company to continue to buy bitcoin on accretive basis, Weiskopf told Blockworks. “After the quarter is reported, we would expect further convertible bond issuance since borrowing at less than 1% and selling stock through a convertible [note] with an additional premium over enterprise value is even more accretive than simply selling stock through an [at-the-market offering],” he added. The stock trading at a premium to its net asset value is supported by several factors, Palmer argued. “The most impactful of these is MSTR’s demonstrated ability to tap the capital markets at very attractive interest rates — the two convertible debt offerings the company executed during March had coupons of 0.625% and 0.875% — and then use the proceeds to purchase more bitcoin,” he said.

Its primary objective is to offer a versatile and expandable blockchain platform that facilitates the execution of smart contracts. This platform opens the doors to a diverse array of decentralized financial applications, innovative cryptocurrency tokens, captivating games, and various other possibilities for development. Established in 2015, Cardano has emerged as a prominent player among global cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization.Cardano’s associated cryptocurrency is actually called ADA, but many people use ADA and Cardano interchangeably. Cardano’s coin is named after Ada Lovelace, a 19th-century mathematician known as the first computer programmer. In 2021, Cardano made significant progress by introducing smart contract support through its Alonzo update. This testnet update marked the initial step in delivering the anticipated scalability and diverse applications to Cardano users. With this update, users gained the ability to develop smart contracts, create non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and manage multiple assets. Subsequent releases and forks are expected to further enhance the mainnet by introducing additional smart contract functionalities and expanding its capabilities. Bitcoin and Cardano exhibit distinct differences in their design and functionality. While Bitcoin was primarily developed as a peer-to-peer payment system, Cardano encompasses an entire ecosystem that enables developers to create tokens, decentralized applications (dApps), and various other use cases on a scalable blockchain network. One significant difference lies in their consensus mechanisms. Cardano employs a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) approach, whereas Bitcoin relies on a competitive mining process that rewards participants with the cryptocurrency. By utilizing PoS, Cardano minimizes energy consumption and waste by eliminating the need for power-intensive mining rigs. Instead, Cardano users can install compatible wallet software on their computers or devices, stake their Ada (Cardano’s cryptocurrency), and actively participate in the network to earn rewards. This unique approach allows Cardano to reduce its environmental impact while providing users with the opportunity to contribute to the network and earn incentives through staking their Ada. Cardano boasts a notable advantage in transaction processing speed compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum 1.0, often referred to as Classic Ethereum. With the capacity to handle over 250 transactions per second (TPS), Cardano surpasses the transaction throughput of Bitcoin, which is approximately 4.6 TPS, as well as Ethereum 1.0, which typically ranges between 15 and 45 TPS. This impressive transaction processing capability positions the Cardano network as highly scalable and efficient in facilitating a large volume of transactions. Cardano is significantly more environmentally friendly than Bitcoin, claiming to be 1.6 million times more energy-efficient. Please note that the following statement is our opinion and should not be considered financial advice. Cardano looks well-positioned to reach its full potential in the coming years. If Cardano successfully boosts market sentiment among crypto enthusiasts, ADA crypto price could continue to rise for the next five years. As per our Cardano price prediction 2023, ADA coin is expected to reach a possible high of $0.72 by the end of 2023. We forecast a minimum price of $0.27 and an average price of $0.41 for the year. In the long term, we expect the price of cryptocurrency to grow systematically. By 2025, the price growth is expected to be more than 60% of the current price. We believe that Ada is a good investment and will continue to grow in the long term, with the possibility of periodic price declines.  More: What is Solana? Is it good investment in 2023?

Share this article E-commerce firm eBay may be rethinking its NFT and Web3 strategy after reportedly laying off over 30% of its Web3 division staff. According to an initial report from NFT news platform NFTgators, sources indicate that several employees “involved with Web3” operations have recently left the organization. The move comes after eBay acquired Manchester-based NFT marketplace KnownOrigin in June 2022, whose team and IP became part of the company’s Web3 division. Before this acquisition, eBay had a concurrent partnership with OneOf, a Web3 firm working with music NFTs. eBay later acquired TCGplayer for $295 million to expand its digital collectibles business. The report also highlights that Stef Jay, eBay’s business and strategy officer for the Web3 division, has resigned. David Moore, a founder from KnownOrigin, has also reportedly been made redundant (dismissed), although it was not clarified whether this was an individual redundancy case or a collective one. According to NFTgator’s source, KnownOrigin and eBay had a falling out, with the latter halting all plans for NFTs and other types of digital collectibles on its platform. “Many within the company are unhappy, blaming the lack of leadership and strategy for the layoffs. There are internal criticisms, even at senior levels, questioning the qualifications of the current head of web3 as well as eBay’s strategy team,” the source states. The crypto bear market for the past couple of years has heavily impacted interest and sales in NFTs. However, newer collections, such as Pudgy Penguins, Mutant Ape Yacht Club, Moonbirds, Mad Lads, and Quantum Cats, among others, have seen renewed interest. Bitcoin Ordinals have also been gaining traction since their introduction in mid-December last year. According to data from Forbes, the global NFT market cap has reached roughly $50 billion, with a $46 million trading volume in the past 24 hours. Despite these developments, it appears that eBay is either doing a strategy pivot or is simply reorganizing its Web3 initiatives in a leaner direction. The company has not publicly acknowledged or confirmed the reasons for these changes.

Bitcoin functions as a form of digital cash; really, it is a technology, using cryptography to ensure the validity of transactions and periodically generate new bitcoins. Bitcoin has grown into an industry now worth more than US$6 billion. Last week, the ATO published long-awaited guidance on the Australian tax treatment of bitcoin, in the form of draft rulings regarding income tax, Goods and Services Tax and Fringe Benefits Tax. The ATO’s position is that bitcoin is property. So bitcoin’s tax treatment for income tax, GST, and FBT, follows that of a valuable commodity such as gold or shares. Where bitcoins are exchanged for other property or services, this is treated as a barter transaction. Both the supply of bitcoin and the AUD (Australian dollar) value of the property received may be taxable. Where a taxpayer holds bitcoin as an investment, capital gains tax (CGT) may apply to gains or losses made on the disposal of the bitcoin. This requires the taxpayer to track the purchase and sale price of bitcoin in Australian dollars. If the transaction remains under the A$10,000 CGT personal-use threshold, individuals who use bitcoin to purchase goods or services for personal use will not be subject to CGT. Equally, individuals are not required to report or collect GST when using bitcoin to purchase items for personal consumption. However, businesses will be taxable where bitcoin is received as payment for an ordinary business transaction, as the business must report as income the AUD value of the bitcoin received. Where bitcoin is paid to an employee, it is a property fringe benefit and FBT may apply to its AUD value. And if a business acquires and exchanges bitcoin in the ordinary course of business, the bitcoin is treated as trading stock. The ATO says bitcoin mining can be a business, depending on the scale and nature of the bitcoin operations. Mining could be treated as generating services income, as miners verify the validity of bitcoin transactions; but if bitcoin is really an intangible commodity, perhaps this is a business of acquiring or producing that commodity itself. The CGT treatment of bitcoin means bitcoins are not fungible. For example, over time, a business or investor acquires three bitcoins for a cost of $100, $500, and $1000 respectively. Later, one bitcoin is valued at $500, and the business wishes to use one bitcoin to pay for a $500 transaction. This could generate very different tax consequences depending on which bitcoin is sold: a taxable gain, a loss, or no net tax. This produces tax planning opportunities, as for other investments such as shares. Valuing bitcoin is difficult as it has “no intrinsic value” (as noted in an OECD working paper). It is also highly volatile. Determining market value at receipt and disposal of each bitcoin will result in administrative costs. GST will apply to a supply of bitcoin by a registered business and it is not treated as an input-taxed financial supply or as money. When bitcoin is used in a transaction with another business, two GST events occur: the supply of the product and the supply of the bitcoin. If cash were used, GST would be charged only on the product. While a business purchaser is entitled to an input credit for both the bitcoin and product supplies, this approach presents a commercial disincentive for using bitcoin as a means of exchange compared to Australian dollars. It is likely to be more costly and difficult for businesses to reuse bitcoin in business-to-business transactions. The ATO’s approach is broadly consistent with the tax rulings issued to date by many other countries. US IRS guidance issued in March this year acknowledged bitcoin is a “convertible virtual currency” but states that for tax purposes it should be treated as property. Since then, a range of software has been created that helps automatically complete administrative tasks like valuing bitcoin. But other countries have taken a more flexible view. The UK has avoided giving a blanket tax classification to bitcoin, instead stating tax rules would be applied depending on the facts. HMRC guidance also notes that, given their volatility, bitcoin investments could be considered as gambling gains or losses (and therefore gains may not be taxable - or losses deductible). Most significantly for businesses, the UK takes the view that VAT will not be chargeable on bitcoin mining or on most trading transactions. Uncertainty about VAT and bitcoin in Europe has led Sweden to recently request that the EU Court rule on the VAT status of bitcoin. The ATO considered whether bitcoin should be treated as a foreign currency or “money” for tax. Some Australian and English courts have taken a functional approach to defining money as a “generally accepted medium and means of exchange, without being legal tender” [Emmett J, Travelex]. However, this is not widely accepted and other courts indicate that money must be issued or authorised by an act of sovereignty. A fundamental feature of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is that they are non-fiat, that is, not established or backed by a government. But what if bitcoin was to gain recognition as a currency by governments in future? This would undermine the ATO approach. California recently legislated to remove impediments for corporations to put bitcoin into circulation although its not legal tender in the US. The ATO rulings do not discuss jurisdiction to tax bitcoin and nor do they address the challenges of secrecy and tax evasion or money laundering potential of bitcoin. These and other issues are raised in a recent OECD report on tax and the digital economy and an OECD working paper. The question of which country has a right to tax (and ability to enforce tax rules) is increasingly difficult to answer in the digital world. If mining, or trading, bitcoin is a business or service, where does this occur, given that bitcoin operates on a global peer-to-peer network? It’s possible that countries will treat bitcoin differently for tax and other regulatory purposes. The German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority classifies bitcoin as a financial instrument or “unit of account” that functions as a form of private money, for regulatory purposes. The inability to identify bitcoin owners is a serious problem for regulators, who may treat bitcoin as currency or cash for transaction reporting purposes even though tax authorities view it as property - and that could help tax authorities with enforcement. The tax and regulatory challenges of cryptocurrencies are only just beginning.::2014-08-27T20:54:37Z::Australian Taxation Office, Bitcoin, Taxation::Joel Emery::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/57473/original/vgz87m4y-1409113755.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

Bitcoin (BTC) surged past $66,000 for the first time since April 24, and was recently up more than 7% over the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH) changed hands near $3,000 but underperformed with a 4% advance during the same period. Solana (SOL) and near (NEAR) led gains among crypto majors with 8% and 12% jumps, respectively, and the broader market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) was up 6%. The rally occurred as April U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures edged lower from March, coupled with a slightly sluggish retail sales report. The data came as a relief for investors fearing that reaccelerating inflation and a red-hot economy might force the Federal Reserve to walk back its dovish pivot and even consider interest rate hikes. "Investors consider this as a bullish regime shift, as it marks the first decrease in CPI inflation over the last three months," Bitfinex analysts said in a market update. This, together with the Federal Reserve previously announcing its intention to taper the central bank's balance sheet run-off, "is seen as a favorable print for risk assets," Bitfinex added. Looking at traditional markets, U.S. equities also climbed during the day, with the S&P 500 index gaining more than 1% and hitting a fresh all-time high, underscoring the return of risk appetite. Today's bitcoin surge also marked a break-out from a downtrend that capped prices for the last few weeks, Swissblock analysts said in a Telegram update. "BTC [is] finally making the bigger move," Swissblock said. "We have been waiting for the trigger for the release of a larger structure since March high. Today we got that," referring to the CPI and retail sales numbers. The analytics firm said the breakout opens the way for BTC to rally $69,000 first, then later potentially towards new all-time highs targeting the $84,000 price level. During the next leg up, "altcoins will follow strongly," the report added. Edited by Stephen Alpher.

492::https://beincrypto.com/donald-trump-meme-coins-skyrocketing/::BeInCrypto::article::This Investment in Donald Trump-Themed Meme Coins Triggers Price Boom::Donald Trump-themed meme coins surge up to 124% in 24 hours, gaining the spotlight among crypto enthusiasts.::We use cookies to improve your experience.  Donald Trump-themed altcoins have experienced a meteoric rise, capturing the attention of both crypto enthusiasts and political spectators. This surge comes as Mechanism Capital, a prominent crypto fund, announces its strategic investment in Trump-related meme coins, marking its first new positions in 2024. The crypto market has witnessed substantial volatility with several Trump-themed tokens on blockchains like Ethereum and Solana. In fact, they have registered gains of up to 124% in just 24 hours. This unprecedented spike is largely attributed to Mechanism Capital’s bullish stance on such assets. Andrew Kang, co-founder of Mechanism Capital, explained the rationale. He highlighted the potent combination of meme coins and Donald Trump’s ability to dominate the news cycle, especially with ongoing US primary elections. Read more: 7 Hot Meme Coins and Altcoins that are Trending in 2024 Kang stressed that the appeal of Trump-themed meme coins goes beyond election outcomes. It is tied to Trump’s continuous media presence, driven by his provocative statements and numerous legal battles. These factors create an ongoing news cycle, keeping Trump and Trump-themed altcoins in the spotlight. “This bet is not just on whether Trump wins or not. Polling indicates that he’s very likely to win but that’s not the point. The point is that he’s going to be in headlines everywhere all the time and people are constantly going to be talking about Trump. His whole strategy is being provocative, saying outrageous and funny things, things that get the people going,” Kang explained. DexTools data confirms the increasing interest in MAGA’s TRUMP token. It boasts a market capitalization of over $117.27 million. It also recorded trading volumes of $4.84 million in the last 24 hours. Additionally, a crypto wallet, possibly linked to Trump, holds more than $1.45 million in TRUMP tokens. Initially funded with $7,100 from the meme coin’s developers, this wallet’s value has skyrocketed, highlighting the rising speculative interest in Trump’s political actions. Read more: 13 Best Altcoins To Invest In February 2024 Moreover, TRUMP tokens now represent the lion’s share of Donald Trump’s crypto holdings, surpassing even mainstream assets like Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) and Ethereum (ETH). This shift reflects the unique appeal of Trump-themed digital assets and signals a broader trend of political figures influencing market dynamics in the crypto ecosystem. Kang acknowledged the investment strategy’s risks. Meme coins’ volatility and the uncertainty of Trump’s support for the TRUMP token present significant challenges. Nevertheless, Kang maintained optimism, comparing it to the meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, which have endured similar challenges.

493::https://blockworks.co/news/2024-bitcoin-halving-new-era::Blockworks::article::The 2024 halving could usher in a new era for Bitcoin::Opinion: The fourth Bitcoin halving event, expected to fall on April 19, 2024, heralds a significant transformation in the crypto landscape.::The upcoming halving brings forth novel dynamics that could reshape prevailing narratives around Bitcoin economics Artwork by Crystal Le The fourth Bitcoin halving event, expected to fall on or around April 19, 2024, heralds a significant transformation in the cryptocurrency landscape. At its core, the quadrennial halving event entails a reduction in the reward granted to miners for each block mined on the Bitcoin blockchain (the block subsidy) as determined by the protocol. Halvings are scheduled to occur roughly every four years, or every 210,000 blocks until the entire 21 million bitcoin supply is mined, approximately by 2140. As part of bitcoin’s deflationary approach to its capped supply, the upcoming halving will reduce the bitcoin supply subsidy from 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC, fostering a more stringent supply landscape. Read more: The history of Bitcoin halvings — and why this time might look different By gradually decreasing the number of bitcoin entering circulation, and, so long as the adoption of Bitcoin grows over time, the halving mechanism ensures the laws of supply and demand will consistently impact the value of the asset. Historically, each halving event has been accompanied by a significant surge in bitcoin price in the months preceding and following the event. The pre-halving rally has shown a diminishing trend over time, likely due to miners selling off their bitcoin holdings to secure profits ahead of the impending reward reduction. Read more: Bitcoin miner consolidation appears imminent as halving looms Nevertheless, the historical pattern suggests the potential for bitcoin to reach new all-time highs in the aftermath of the 2024 halving. The landscape surrounding bitcoin has evolved significantly, particularly with the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs and the influx of institutional capital into the market. These ETFs have generated substantial daily demand, surpassing the pace of new bitcoin supply even before the halving and have the potential to absorb a considerable portion of the limited new issuance. To put the spot bitcoin ETF inflows into perspective, at the current rate of block rewards, the bitcoin network produces about 900 new coins per day, or around $54 million worth of bitcoin (assuming an average price per coin of $60,000). In April 2024, issuance will fall to 450 coins, or about $27 million worth of bitcoin. During the month of February, net inflows into the US-listed spot bitcoin ETFs averaged $208 million per day, far outstripping the pace of new supply, even before the halving. Read more: Bitcoin ETF snapshot: Segment’s week net inflows hit record $2.5B This imbalance between new demand and limited new issuance has likely contributed to the strong upward pressure on the price. The emergence of a robust, regulated derivatives market marks a fundamental shift in the narrative surrounding the halving for three key reasons: It enables price risks to be hedged, it facilitates the management of bitcoin demand risk, and it provides market participants with actionable price discovery. Miners typically sold their bitcoin for fiat currency as they mined them, to pay for operational costs. This constant selling meant that price appreciation was measured. After a halving event, miners would have fewer bitcoin to sell, meaning the price could go up. Mining is now dominated by larger, often publicly traded, companies and with a liquid regulated derivatives market, it is possible for these firms to hedge and lock in future bitcoin prices to cover expenses without selling their coins. If this is the case, then selling pressure from miners is less likely to act as a drag on bitcoin prices going forward. A higher number of investors and traders means better liquidity and enhanced price stability for bitcoin. It’s worth noting that bitcoin has become less volatile in recent years, with fewer extreme moves both to the upside and to the downside The impending halving poses challenges and opportunities for miners, as evidenced by shifts in miner behavior and industry dynamics. Decreased bitcoin reserves held by miners, coupled with heightened competition and record high hash rates, underscore the need for operational efficiency and strategic adaptation. The number of bitcoin held in wallets associated with miners has dropped to the lowest level since July 2021, suggesting miners are perhaps capitalizing on bitcoin’s recent price surge, running down their inventory ahead of the halving or leveraging them to raise capital for upgrading machinery and mining facilities. In previous cycles, there weren’t many large-scale miners and even fewer publicly traded ones. The halving may catalyze merger and acquisition activities among mining firms, driving industry consolidation and fostering innovation in sustainable mining practices. The recent surge in retail demand can be attributed in part to the rise of bitcoin Ordinals BRC-20 tokens, which are reshaping the crypto landscape. These tokens, often likened to “NFTs for Bitcoin,” have the potential to drive on-chain activity and increase transaction fees, thereby bolstering miners’ revenue streams amid declining block rewards post-halving. Bitcoin’s designation as “digital gold” underscores its role as a store of value, particularly amid the scarcity reinforced by halving events. Institutional investors who view bitcoin as a hedge against inflation may find the halving supportive of its perceived value. Shifts in central bank policies, such as prolonged higher interest rates and potential quantitative easing measures, could further bolster bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge against currency devaluation. Read more from our opinion section: Stop worrying so much about the next Bitcoin halving Looking ahead, the implication of bitcoin’s programmed scarcity intersecting with evolving demand dynamics remains intriguing. While past having cycles, with the associated price rallies offer valuable insights, the 2024 halving presents a unique confluence of factors that could usher in a new era for bitcoin. With 28 more halving events expected over the next 112 years, the future trajectory of bitcoin adoption and network growth warrants close monitoring — especially when broader access to bitcoin was only made possible in the US less than 90 days ago with the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs. As institutional and retail interest converges with regulatory developments and macroeconomic shifts, maintaining a balanced perspective is imperative to navigating the evolving Bitcoin landscape.

The ongoing management of this open-source project is currently handled by the Solana Foundation, which is based in Geneva. Solana (SOL) was designed with the intention to function similarly to Ethereum. The platform was created by Anatoly Yakovenko, a software developer, and takes its name from a charming coastal city in Southern California. Related: What is Tether (1 USDT)? How does it work? The Solana network offers a wide range of capabilities commonly found in other cryptocurrency networks, such as smart contracts, transaction settlement, and token issuance. However, Solana aims to distinguish itself from its competitors by delivering faster settlement times and greater transaction capacity. Solana has been used for the development of NFT (Non-Fungible Token) applications, enabling users to create and trade digital artwork. Users have the ability to establish their own NFT and us various tools to generate NFT. Furthermore they can integrate NFTs into other applications, such as games, expanding the possibilities for their utilization. In addition, Solana provides support for games that implement Play-2-Earn systems, enabling players to earn cryptocurrencies and NFTs as they engage in gameplay. Several popular games that are backed by Solana include Aurory, Chainers, and the Naga Kingdom. These games offer an innovative approach where players can be rewarded with valuable digital assets while enjoying their gaming experience. Amazing developments are taking place on the Solana blockchain, enabling programmers to create apps that, can leverage the latest internet technology. Some of the well-known applications include: Dispatch, Alchemy and Audius. Please note that the following statement is our opinion and should not be considered financial advice. In our oppinion the Solana blockchain offers users the advantage of affordable transaction fees while maintaining a high level of stability and effectiveness. This combination of factors makes solana an appealing choice for long-term cryptocurrency investments. Investing in SOL at its current trading levels may be a favorable decision considering it is trading near its lows. However, it is important to acknowledge the high volatility associated with any cryptocurrency. It is crucial to never risk more than what you are willing to lose. To optimize your return on investment, particularly in the cryptocurrency market, it is advisable to consider a long-term investment strategy.

496::https://theconversation.com/with-bitcoin-hitting-new-highs-itll-likely-reach-the-us-100-000-milestone-before-2024-is-out-225591::The Conversation::article::With bitcoin hitting new highs, it’ll likely reach the US$100,000 milestone before 2024 is out::Often dismissed as a libertarian ponzi scheme, why has crypto bounced back yet again?::Cryptocurrencies are surging again. Bitcoin has just hit an all-time high of more than US$72,000 (£56,300), pushing past the level of circa US$69,000 where it turned back during its last bull phase in late 2021. Other top cryptocurrencies like ethereum and solana have reached their highest prices in three years, on the back of a run that has been going since the autumn. The value of the whole cryptocurrency market has raced up to US$2.6 trillion, triple what it was worth at the beginning of 2023 and not far off its previous US$3 trillion peak. Much of this run has occurred at a time when the US dollar has been strengthening against other currencies (though it has fallen in the past couple of weeks). This can often be a time when cryptocurrencies get weaker, so it shows how strong they have been lately. Many other fiat currencies around the world have been losing value against the US dollar during this period, so bitcoin reached all-time highs in many of them long before it finally took out its high in the US currency. So what has contributed to this explosion in prices and where is the market going for the rest of 2024? A major driver for this appreciation in prices has been the US authorities’ approval in January of an investment vehicle known as an exchange-traded fund or ETF for the general or “spot” bitcoin market. An ETF is an easy way for the average saver to get exposure to an asset, since they buy shares in the vehicle, usually through their financial advisor, rather than having to go to the trouble of buying the underlying asset. A total of 11 bitcoin ETFs were approved in the US, and their daily trading volume has now exceeded US$10 billion – driven by frontrunners Blackrock and Fidelity Investments. This demonstrates the large interest from traditional market participants, and as the spot ETFs become more mature, their providers will offer more promotional material and education to get more customers onboard. Bitcoin/US$ price The cryptocurrency market is always adapting and innovating, and one possible future innovation is the offer of option contracts on the new spot ETFs. Options allow traders to hedge their bets on whether the crypto market will go up or down, and would likely attract even more new money into the space. However, US regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has just postponed a decision on this innovation until late April. Some experts think approval may take longer than that as it is unclear which regulatory body would be responsible for policing this new class of derivative contracts. One feature of the bitcoin system which was built in at the beginning is that, roughly every four years, the rewards to companies using arrays of computers to create or “mine” bitcoin get cut in half. The last halving took place in May 2020, where miners went from receiving 12.5 bitcoin for each unit of work they do to 6.25 bitcoin. The next is due to take place on April 19, cutting the reward down to 3.125 bitcoin. Because each halving means less new bitcoin coming on to the market, they have coincided with strong price appreciation in the cryptocurrency. What isn’t clear is whether this is already priced in and therefore not actually the reason price is going up. One theory is that the institutions behind the spot ETFs are buying aggressively now because they know there will be less bitcoin on the open market once the halving takes place. Meanwhile, the crypto market could also be boosted by spot ETFs for the ethereum cryptocurrency system in the coming months. At least ten firms, including Blackrock and Fidelity, have applied to launch them and the SEC has until May to make a decision. Whereas the online ledger that underpins bitcoin, known as its blockchain, has been seen largely as a store of value, ethereum has become the leading blockchain for developers to write applications using this technology. SEC Chair Gary Gensler believes that most cryptocurrencies should be treated differently to bitcoin, as financial instruments known as securities rather than as more straightforward commodities. This adds complexity to the ethereum ETF approval process. If the US authorities were to decide it was the case, it would mean that ETFs couldn’t buy ethereum from crypto exchanges until those exchanges had received approval to trade it as a security. While that uncertainty continues, ethereum could be boosted by the so-called Dencun upgrade (also known as Duncan or EIP-4844). Ethereum has competition from other blockchains such as solana and avalanche due to its relatively slow transaction speed and high costs. It already completed its first major step in a long-term plan to reduce costs and cope with many more users (known as scalability) when it transitioned in 2023 to a different system for verifying transactions known as proof of stake. The Dencun upgrade, which goes live on March 13, will further improve scalability by making data storage more efficient on the network, while also lowering transaction fees. Predicting cryptocurrency prices is not for the faint-hearted. The market is very volatile, and often exceeds expectations when it goes up or down. The behaviour of individuals determines market prices and, as Isaac Newton put it, you can “calculate the motions of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of the people”. However, the majority of commentators expect crypto prices to keep rising over the coming months. Election years tend to be good for investments in general, while a second Trump administration would probably create a more favourable regulatory environment for crypto assets (as would a Rishi Sunak victory in the UK, however unlikely that seems at present). As bitcoin becomes more and more mainstream and integrated with traditional assets, it isn’t inconceivable that it could hit US$100,000 in 2024 – an extraordinary feat for a invention that was worth nothing as recently as 2009.::2024-03-12T14:39:27Z::Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, Ethereum::Andrew Urquhart::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/581312/original/file-20240312-22-2jc5dz.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=118%2C468%2C4695%2C2347&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
497::https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/16/bitcoin-has-best-day-in-2-months-as-markets-anticipate-a-summer-of-easing/::CoinDesk::article::Bitcoin Has Best Day in 2 Months as Markets Anticipate a ‘Summer of Easing'::The net percent of global central banks cutting rates is increasing in a positive sign for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.::Bitcoin (BTC) posted its biggest single-day gain in nearly two months on Wednesday as weak U.S. economic data raised the probability that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will join its advanced nation peers in easing monetary policy with rate cuts over the summer months. According to data sources TradingView and CoinDesk, the leading cryptocurrency by market value rose over 7.5% to $66,250, the largest percentage rise since March 20. Like other risk assets, BTC is sensitive to expected changes in the monetary policy stance of major central banks and rallies when the cost of borrowing fiat money is forecast to decline. Data released by the U.S. Labor Department Wednesday showed the consumer price index (CPI) increased less than consensus estimates in April, signaling a renewed downward shift in the cost of living in the world’s largest economy. The headline CPI rose 0.3% last month after advancing 0.4% in March and February. The core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 0.3% in April after advancing 0.4% in March. Other data showed that headline retail sales growth stalled in April, with the sales in the “control group” category, which feeds into the GDP calculation, declining 0.3% month-on-month. As such, rate-cut expectations shifted significantly. Fed funds futures show traders expect the Fed to deliver the first 25 basis point rate cut in September. (This year’s summer is set to start on June 20 and end on September 22). The Fed recently signaled that it will reduce the pace of quantitative tightening, also a liquidity tightening tool, from June. It’s not just the Fed. Markets expect the Bank of England (BOE) and the European Central Bank (ECB) to cut rates in June. The Swiss National Bank (SNB) and Sweden’s Riksbank have already reduced their benchmark borrowing costs. Central banks worldwide are pivoting toward renewed monetary or liquidity easing, which is a positive sign for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, as evident from the chart below from the data tracking website MacroMicro. The percentage of global central banks whose last move was a rate hike is falling fast, while the percentage of banks with rate cuts as the last move is rising. In other words, the net percentage of central bank cutting rates is rising. “The higher the proportion goes, the more central banks are cutting rates, which could help improve market liquidity. The lower the proportion, the less liquidity there is in the market,” MacroMicro said in the explainer. Prospects for liquidity easing over Summer should support equities, giving investors adequate confidence "to remain further out on the risk curve," according to broking firm Pepperstone.

498::https://beincrypto.com/airdrop-token-trading-crypto-exchanges/::BeInCrypto::article::This Is the Latest Airdrop Token That Will Be Listed on Binance Today::New trading opportunities emerge as major centralized exchanges, including Binance, list an innovative airdrop token.::We use cookies to improve your experience.  Leading crypto exchanges, including Binance, have announced the listing of the airdrop token – Dymension (DYM) on February 6. This development introduces new trading opportunities for Binance users with the inclusion of DYM/BTC, DYM/USDT, DYM/FDUSD, and DYM/TRY spot trading pairs. Starting at 17:00 UTC Tuesday, users can deposit DYM for upcoming trading activities. Withdrawal options will be available starting at 15:00 UTC Wednesday. Dymension, a newcomer in crypto, gained attention for its innovative approach, using the Inter-Blockchain Communication standard to secure and interconnect rollups. This modular blockchain raised $6.7 million in a private token round. It garnered support from notable backers like Big Brain Holdings, Stratos Technologies, and MatchboxDAO, showing institutional confidence in its potential. However, with great potential comes heightened risk and volatility. Hence, Binance has applied the Seed Tag to DYM, demanding thorough research and risk management from investors. “The Seed Tag represents innovative project that may exhibit higher volatility and risks compared to other listed tokens. The Seed Tag will be applied to DYM,” Binance stated. Other prominent exchanges like KuCoin, ByBit, MEXC, Bitget, and Gate.io will also list DYM, further broadening its market presence. While the DYM IOU is currently trading at $4, indicative of high-interest levels, it is crucial to note that this price may not reflect the token’s value upon official trading commencement.

Bitcoin and ether lost 5% and 7%, respectively, over 24 hours, according to data from Coinbase. Bitcoin (BTC) is now trading around $65,200 after managing to stay in the low $70,000 range over the weekend. Ether (ETH) hovered at $3,200 Tuesday afternoon, per Coinbase, continuing a selloff that started Monday. “The onset of [the second quarter] has been marked by pronounced deleveraging, evidenced by the decline in perpetual funding rates from ~80% to ~11% over the last three sessions,” research analysts at Wintermute wrote in a Tuesday note. “This reflects a broad correction, with traders closing out highly leveraged positions and reassessing flow.” Read more: Why is 2140 the end of bitcoin inflation? The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes opened lower but recovered slightly later in the session, with each trading around 1% lower at time of publication.

Fed fund futures show a 40% chance central bankers will hold rates at their current level through June, according to CME Group. The decline in crypto prices comes as bitcoin’s next halving event inches closer. The date of the largest cryptocurrency’s fourth halving is expected to be around April 19, 2024. “While the short-term price impact of the halving has been mixed in the past, BTC tends to increase in the nine to 12 months post-halving,” analysts from research firm Kaiko wrote in a note Tuesday.

Tether Limited developed the digital currency USDT to serve as the internet’s Digital Dollar, with each token worth $1 USD and being backed by $1 USD in real money. A low volatility digital asset that often keeps a steady valuation is offered by stablecoins like Tether. A stablecoin seeks to keep the same value as its peg by having its value tied to a stable asset, such as gold, the US dollar, or another fiat currency. Investors who want to protect their digital currency assets from inherent volatility utilize it to do so while maintaining value inside the cryptocurrency market that is readily available for use. The precursor to Tether, originally named “Realcoin”, was announced in July 2014 by co-founders Brock Pierce, Reeve Collins, and Craig Sellars as a Santa Monica based startup. The first tokens were issued on 6 October 2014, on the Bitcoin blockchain. This was done by using the Omni Layer Protocol. On 20 November 2014, Tether CEO Reeve Collins announced the project was being renamed to “Tether”. The company also announced it was entering private beta, which supported a “Tether+ token” for three currencies: USTether (US+) for United States dollars, EuroTether (EU+) for euros and YenTether (JP+) for Japanese yen. Tether said “Every Tether+ token is backed 100% by its original currency, and can be redeemed at any time with no exposure to exchange risk. Through cryptocurrency exchanges, you can purchase Tether with fiat money like euros or dollars. Get acquainted with the USDT price history and the current exchange rate first. Your Tether investment can be viewed and used in a digital wallet that looks like a banking app once it has been purchased. After that, you can decide whether to keep your USDT or sell it again on the exchange. You can buy Tether, on a number of well-known exchanges. Tether (USDT) can be used to buy a variety of commodities from different vendors or to convert into other currencies. Tether has already established partnerships with a number of businesses and services, making it possible to pay with cryptocurrency for things like hotel stays and flights, as well as a few other establishments that recognize Tether as legal tender. Some people will buy USDT in order to buy NFTs, and take part in ICOs. The corporation did not provide much detail about its reserves until 2022. Previously, the only statement on Tether’s website was “All Tether tokens are pegged at 1-to-1 with a matching fiat currency and are backed 100% by Tether’s reserves.” Stablecoins require significant financial reserves. They back each unit with tangible assets, fostering stability and trust. A steady reserve serves to guarantee trust and a constant value. The stablecoin may depeg, or lose its 1:1 value with the original fiat currency, when reserves are threatened. Another stablecoin, USDC, fell as low as $0.88 in March, at the height of the spring banking crisis.

501::https://cryptobriefing.com/opensea-considers-acquisition-nft-market-consolidation-continues/::Crypto Briefing::article::OpenSea considers acquisition as NFT market consolidation continues::Finzer stated in a recent interview that OpenSea has received offers and interest regarding an acquisition.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea remains “open” to the prospect of an acquisition as the broader NFT industry sees increased consolidation, according to CEO Devin Finzer. “We think that if the right partnership comes along, then that’s something we should certainly consider,” Finzer shares. Finzer stated in a recent interview that OpenSea has received offers and interest regarding an acquisition. Once a dominant player in the NFT sector, OpenSea has been overtaken by Blur, a rival marketplace. Despite having fewer overall users, Blur sees over five times more volume. OpenSea previously had a 90% dominance in the NFT sector. According to data from Dune Analytics, its monthly trading volume has plunged by 96% and is down to just $171 million, with an annualized revenue of $38.9 million. Finzer claims that Blur’s growth tactics involved cutting corners, particularly in terms of legal and regulatory compliance. Blur’s rapid growth is often attributed to its aggressive token airdrops and the marketing campaigns that push these. Market observers see parallels in crypto’s latest bull market resurgence, creating prime conditions for industry consolidation. Dealmakers seek bargains and synergies as prices recover from the crypto crash from the past two years. OpenSea itself stayed active via acquisitions in 2022, purchasing NFT data provider Gem, crypto wallet Dharma Labs, and NFT launch platform Mintdrop. Finzer cites gaining top talent as a key driver for such deals. OpenSea counts high-profile venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz, Paradigm, and Coatue Management among its top investors. They participated in massive fundraising rounds in 2021, when OpenSea achieved a peak $13 billion valuation amid the NFT hype cycle. However, as the NFT market crashed, valuations also crashed. Coatue reportedly slashed the value of its OpenSea stake by 90% late last year. Andreessen Horowitz helped OpenSea raise $423 million in funding for three series in 2021. The prolific firm, led by Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, has backed over 20 crypto startups at a valuation above $1 billion. In November 2023, OpenSea laid off approximately 20 employees, or 50% of its staff, amid plunging NFT sales. “The restructuring that we did was really oriented around adjusting the team composition to be a much leaner, smaller team that can operate more nimbly in the market, as opposed to downsizing due to financial pressure,” Finzer said. Whether driven by financial duress or not, downsizing suggests the firm reset its operations to contend with new competitive and market realities. With OpenSea struggling to maintain market share versus rivals like Blur, its high-profile backers have seen the value of their stakes plummet. Significant dilution should OpenSea raise further rounds, which also presents downside risk.

502::https://theconversation.com/bitcoin-has-shot-up-50-since-the-new-year-but-heres-why-new-lows-are-probably-still-ahead-198682::The Conversation::article::Bitcoin has shot up 50% since the new year, but here’s why new lows are probably still ahead::There’s much excitement among bitcoiners right now – but are they about to be disappointed?::To the delight of investors across the cryptosphere, the price of bitcoin (BTC) has rallied over 53% since its low of US$15,476 (£12,519) in November. Now trading around US$23,000, there’s much talk that the bottom has finally been reached for the leading cryptocurrency after a year of painful decline – in November 2021, the price peaked at almost US$70,000. If so, it’s not only good news for bitcoin but the whole market in cryptocurrencies, since the others broadly move in line with the leader. So is crypto back in business? The past is littered with various periods of market turmoil, from the global financial crisis of 2007-09 to the COVID-19 collapse in 2020. But neither of these is a particularly good comparison for our purposes because they both saw sharp drops and recoveries, as opposed to the slow unwinding of bitcoin. A better comparison would be the dotcom bubble burst in 2000-02, which you can see in the chart below (the Nasdaq is the index that tracks all tech stocks). Nasdaq 100 index 1995-2005 Look at the bitcoin chart since it peaked in November 2021 and the price action looks fairly similar: Bitcoin bear market price chart 2021-23 Both charts show that bear markets go through various periods where prices rise but don’t reach the same level as the previous peak – known as “lower highs”. If bitcoin is following a similar trajectory to the early 2000s Nasdaq, it would make sense that the current price will be another lower high and that it will be followed by another lower low. This is partly because like the 2000s Nasdaq, bitcoin seems to be following a pattern known as an Elliott Wave. Named after the renowned American stock market analyst Ralph Nelson Elliott, this essentially argues that during a bear phase, investors shift between different emotional states of disappointment and hope, before they finally despair and decide the market will never turn in their favour. This is a final wave of heavy selling known as capitulation. You can see this idea on the chart below, where bitcoin is the green and red line and Z is the potential capitulation point at around US$13,000 (click on the chart to make it bigger). The black line is the path that the Nasdaq took in the early 2000s. The blue pointing finger above that line is potentially the equivalent place to where the bitcoin price is now. Bitcoin now vs Nasdaq in the early 2000s The one other thing to note on the chart is the wavy line that’s moving horizontally along the bottom. This is the stochRSI or stochastic relative strength index, which is an indication of when the asset looks overbought (when the line is peaking) or oversold (when it’s bottoming). A sign of a coming shift is when the stochRSI moves in the opposite direction to where the price is heading: so now the stochRSI is coming down but the price has held up around US$23,000. This too suggests a fall could be imminent. Within markets, there is often a game that investors from institutions such as banks and hedge funds play with amateur (retail) investors. The aim is to transfer retail investors’ wealth to these institutions. This is particularly easy in an unregulated market like bitcoin, because it is easier for institutions to manipulate prices. They can also talk up (or talk down) prices to stir up retail investors’ emotions, and get them to buy at the top and sell at the bottom. This “traps” the irrational investors who buy at higher prices, transferring wealth by giving the institutions an opportunity to convert their holdings into cash. It therefore makes sense to compare how the retail and institutional investors have been behaving lately. The following charts compare those crypto wallet addresses that hold 1 BTC or more (mostly retail investors) with those holding upwards of 1,000 BTC (institutional investors). In all three charts, the black line is the bitcoin price and the orange line is the number of wallets in that category. Retail investor behaviour Institutional investor behaviour pt 1 Institutional investor behaviour pt 2 This shows that since the FTX scandal back in November, which led to the world’s second-largest crypto exchange collapse, retail investors have been buying bitcoin aggressively, resulting in the highest number of addresses holding at least one BTC ever. On the other hand, the biggest institutional investors have been offloading. This suggests that the institutional investors agree with our analysis. There are those who argue that bitcoin is a bubble and that ultimately cryptocurrencies are worthless. That’s a separate debate for another day. If we assume there is a future for blockchains, which are the online ledgers that enable cryptocurrencies, the key question is when bitcoin will reach the accumulation phase that typically ends a bear phase in any market. Known as Wyckoff accumulation, this is where the price of the asset repeatedly tests two areas: the upper bound where traders previously sold heavily enough for the price to stop rising (known as resistance), and the lower bound where traders bought heavily enough that the price stopped going down (known as support). At the point where institutional investors decide the lower bound has proved to be sufficiently resilient – in other words, they think the price is cheap at that level – they will start buying the asset again. That moment is only likely to come after there has been a capitulation. Of course, history does not repeat itself exactly. It may be this is the first time that retail investors have outsmarted the large institutions, and that the only way is now up. More likely, however, there is more pain on the way. With a recession on the cards, unprecedented job layoffs and weak retail data coming out of the US, it doesn’t point to the kind of optimism that tends to move markets higher. It would therefore make sense to brace yourself for another plunge in the price of bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market.::2023-01-27T17:04:19Z::Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, NASDAQ, bear market, dotcom bubble::James Kinsella::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/506823/original/file-20230127-16-4cgk1e.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=58%2C268%2C1769%2C883&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

CME is already the top bitcoin futures exchange by open interest, while offshore, non-regulated Binance dominates the spot market. The exchange has held discussions with traders who want to trade bitcoin on a regulated marketplace, the FT reported, citing people with direct knowledge of the talks. CME's spot trading business could be run through the EBS currency trading venue in Switzerland, the report added. The exchange did not want to comment on the report. The spot market will complement the CME’s existing standard and micro futures contracts, which are widely considered a proxy for institutional activity, and help the exchange become more dominant in the crypto market. The CME is already the top bitcoin futures exchange by open interest, while the offshore, non-regulated Binance dominates the spot market. Coinbase (COIN), the only U.S. traded crypto exchange, is No. 3 by daily trading volume. The availability of the spot market means traders can now set up complex multi-leg strategies involving spot and futures markets in one regulated place. Carry traders are known to short CME futures against long spot market positions on other exchanges or in spot ETFs. “Crypto exchanges might lose some business with the potential debut of a bitcoin spot market on the CME, a global derivatives giant, as the present bull run is particularly driven by institutions, who prefer to trade on regulated avenues," Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said.

Learn what's driving its dramatic price increase.::We use cookies to improve your experience.  The altcoin Space ID (ID) witnessed an astonishing 80% surge in value within a few hours, captivating traders and analysts alike. The community is watching Space ID developments closely with questions about the sustainability of this altcoin’s surge. The remarkable uptick in price coincides with South Korea’s largest crypto exchange, Upbit, announcing the introduction of the ID’s Korean won trading pair. ID’s value spike also highlighted DWF Labs’ role in the market. According to SpotOnChain, the firm conducted major transactions with ID tokens. This includes withdrawing 3.62 million ID, worth around $1.73 million, from OKX. Then, it quickly deposited 2.45 million ID, around $1.12 million, to Binance via Amber Group. These network activities were traced back to an address labeled DWF Labs.

This makes Upbit the fifth-largest ID holder. Still, Upbit’s ID accumulation sparks market speculation due to DWF Labs and Upbit’s past impact on token volatility. “In the past, DWF Labs and Upbit were related to the aggressive pumps and dumps of several tokens,” SpotOnChain said.

CryptoNoan, a pseudonymous crypto trader, expressed intentions to short the ID altcoin, citing its overvaluation after the Upbit listing announcement. “ID suddenly became the rarest coin, trading with -3% funding on MEXC. I will short this around 0.48/0.49 after the next funding reset,” CryptoNoan remarked.

The company, which completed a merger of equals with US Bitcoin Corp last year, tallied $60.6 million in revenue during the second half of 2023. Net income was $6.2 million over that span. Nearly 70% of that revenue comes from crypto mining, CEO Asher Genoot said during the company’s earnings call Thursday. But Hut 8 seeks to further diversify its revenue streams across its managed services business, the CEO noted — as well as boost its standing in the high-performance computing (HPC) and AI realms. Read more: Hut 8 switches CEOs as it eyes ‘new strategic direction’ after merger The company jumped into the HPC space by buying wireless connectivity company TerraGo in January 2022. It signed an agreement last year to offer colocation HPC services to Canadian health authority Interior Health. It is not the only one looking into the segment. Hive Digital Technologies rebranded last July as part of a pivot to HPC. Core Scientific said earlier this month it would lease up to 16 megawatts of capacity in its Austin data center to cloud provider CoreWeave. Hut 8’s HPC business is “sub-scale today,” Genoot acknowledged. He added that the HPC business will need more investment to be equipped to handle AI machines. “But we are excited about that business because we see it as a foundation to be able to grow, especially when you look at GPUs, AI and data centers and look at the different parts of the value chain in that ecosystem,” he said on the call. Hut 8 held 9,110 bitcoin (BTC), as of Feb. 29 — valued at roughly $650 million Thursday morning. The miner is set to use its bitcoin reserves to take advantage of growth opportunities around the Bitcoin halving — expected on or around April 20. At that point per-block mining rewards are set to drop from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, putting financial pressure on the segment’s participants.

But Genoot previously told Blockworks that Hut 8 would not seek out growth at all costs — adding that it would look to not overpay for sites, for example, when possible to develop its infrastructure for less. Executives noted during the Thursday call that it would be closely monitoring the prices of mining machines, adding the company may choose to wait until after the halving, or when newer-generation machines are available. Similarly, Core Scientific CEO Adam Sullivan recently told Blockworks his company would look to buy machines — at lower prices — from struggling miners unable to afford parts of their existing orders. It is also set to continue nixing inefficiencies, like retiring old machines — as it did upon shuttering operations at its Drumheller facility in Alberta, Canada earlier this month.

Get the inside scoop and become a crypto master. Don't miss out, start today!::A meme coin (aka memecoin) is a word used in the cryptocurrency world to refer to well-liked currencies that have ardent online supporters and traders and are occasionally portrayed with humorous or animated memes. Meme coins may be entertaining, but they are also extremely risky investments that may or may not have any real value. This group includes currencies like Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, and other altcoins that may be more entertaining than practical. Understanding the dangers is essential while purchasing or trading meme coins so that you can steer clear of unforeseen volatility and losses. Meme coins are a type of cryptocurrency that has an enthusiastic online community that supports its development. They can occasionally be recognized by memes of animated animals or characters. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu were among the top cryptocurrencies to achieve meme coin status during the most recent cryptocurrency boom. Little-known currencies like Baby Doge and Dogelon Mars are included in this list. Baby Doge and Dogelon Mars still have market capitalizations in the nine figures despite receiving less media attention. Memecoins rely on blockchain technology, like other cryptocurrencies, which is a sort of distributed database used to track virtual assets, such as cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Unlike Ethereum and other utility currencies linked to specific blockchain characteristics, the majority of meme coins are just used as trading platforms. Meme coins generally do not include popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dollar Coin, XRP, Cardano, Solana, Polygon, and Polkadot. More than 300 currencies are included in the Meme Coin section of the cryptocurrency website CoinMarketCap. Many, however, are not traded frequently and are hence worthless. Only Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Dogelon Mars, and Baby Dogecoin have a daily trade volume of more than $1 million in the meme currency category. All of them are typically regarded as volatile and dangerous trading assets. While ether is necessary for Ethereum blockchain transactions, the majority of meme coins are just useful for trade and collecting. Some meme coins are actually tokens that operate on a different blockchain rather than actual currency. Shiba Inu, for instance, is an ERC-20 token that runs on the Ethereum network. Meme coins have been referred to as complex pump-and-dump operations by some in the media and investment community. Investors should be extremely cautious when entering these markets as a result of this claim and should be aware of meme currencies. Anyone with the necessary technical knowledge is easily able to create a cryptocurrency. However, turning a coin or token into a popular meme coin is extremely difficult and has only been successfully achieved a few dozen times. There is no exact answer to this question. Meme coin can be both a very good investment and a regular scam. Don’t spend more money on this than you’re willing to spend. Better invest that money in something else.

507::https://cryptobriefing.com/solanas-nft-trading-volume-25-weekly-rise/::Crypto Briefing::article::Solana’s NFT trading volume sees a 25% weekly rise::The $62 million in weekly trades was driven by high-value collections like Tensorians, CryptoUndeads, and Froganas.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Solana’s non-fungible tokens (NFTs) weekly trading volume surpassed $62 million, showing a 25% rise according to on-chain data aggregator CryptoSlam. After a slow January start, Solana (SOL) NFT activity seems to be picking up, with almost $190 million in trading volume this month. In December 2023, Solana’s NFT sales volume went over $365 million and overtook Ethereum’s, only standing behind Bitcoin’s market share. Even with the relatively small volume when compared to last month’s, January’s total amount of sales is the highest Solana has had since May 2022. Despite the rise in sales volume, the number of NFT-related transactions made on Solana’s blockchain fell by 15%. This indicates larger average transactions, which can be related to the NFT collection Tensorians. Their trading volume rose 107% over the past seven days, reaching $4.6 million, and each Tensorian has an 88 SOL floor price. CryptoUndeads and Froganas were also among last week’s most popular Solana NFT collections, showing $15 million and $4.6 million, respectively. Moreover, another interesting development in Solana’s NFT market seen in the past seven days is the fall in transactions labeled by CryptoSlam as wash trading. Although the amount is still relevant, a total of $3.6 million, this is almost 50% less than what was registered from January 11 to 17. In comparison, the amount of NFT sales on Ethereum labeled last week as wash trading is $90.5 million.

508::https://theconversation.com/can-blockchain-a-swiftly-evolving-technology-be-controlled-73471::The Conversation::article::Can blockchain, a swiftly evolving technology, be controlled?::Laws cannot keep pace with technological advances – but that may not be a bad thing.::The headlong pace of technological change produces giant leaps forward in knowledge, innovation, new possibilities and, almost inevitably, legal problems. That’s now the case with blockchain, today’s buzziest new tech tool. Introduced in 2008 as the technology underpinning Bitcoin, a digital currency that is created and held electronically without any central authority, blockchain is a secure digital ledger for any kind of data. It simplifies record keeping and reduces transaction costs. Its range of applications in commerce, finance and potentially politics continues to widen, and that has triggered a debate around how to regulate the tool. Because it does not require a centralised authority to verify and validate transactions, blockchain enables people who may not trust each other to interact and coordinate directly. With blockchain, there is no middleman in peer-to-peer exchanges; instead, users rely on a decentralised network of computers that interact through a cryptographic, secure protocol. Blockchain has the ability to “codify” transactions by deploying small snippets of code directly onto the blockchain. This code, generally referred to as a “smart contract”, executes automatically when certain conditions are met. An early example of smart contracts are the corporate-oriented digital rights management (DRM) systems limiting uses of digital files. Having DRM on your ebook may restrict access to copying, editing, and printing content. With blockchain, smart contracts have become more complex and, arguably, more secure. In theory, they will always be executed exactly as planned, since no one party has the power to alter the code binding a given transaction. In practice, however, eliminating trusted brokers from a transaction can create some kinks. One high-profile smart-contract failure happened to the DAO, a decentralised autonomous organisation for venture capital funding. Launched in April 2016, the DAO quickly raised over US$150 million via crowdfunding. Three weeks later, someone managed to exploit a vulnerability in the DAO’s code, draining approximately US$50 million worth of digital currency from the fund. The security problem originated not in the blockchain itself but rather from issues with the smart-contract code used to administer the DAO. Questions arose about the legality of the act, with some people arguing that since the hack was actually permitted by the smart-contract code, it was a perfectly legitimate action. After all, in cyberspace, “code is law”. The DAO debate raised this key question: should the intention of the code prevail over the wording of the code? Blockchain proponents envision a future in which entire companies and governments operate in a distributed and automated fashion. But smart contracts pose a series of enforceability issues, which are outlined in a recent white paper by the London law firm Norton Rose Fulbright. How can we resolve disputes arising over a self-executing smart contract? How do we identify what types of contractual terms can be properly translated into code, and which ones should instead be left to natural language? And is there a way combine the two? It is not yet clear that code can address the necessary levels of complexity to replace legal language. After all, the vagueness inherent in the language of law is a feature, not a bug: it compensates for unforeseeable cases that must be assessed on a case-by-case basis in a court of law. Traditional contracts acknowledge that no law can index the entire complexity of life as it is, let alone predict its future development. They also precisely define terms that can be enforced by law. Smart contracts, by contrast, are simply snippets of code both defined and enforced by the code underpinning the blockchain infrastructure. Currently, they do not have any legal recognition. This means that when something goes wrong in a smart contract, parties have no legal recourse. The DAO’s founders painfully learned this lesson last year. If blockchain technologies are ever to go mainstream, governments will have to set up new legal frameworks to accommodate such complexities. Positive law prescribes behaviour and penalises non-compliance. It can encapsulate the normative ideal that a respective government seeks to achieve, demonstrate an ethical vision for society or reify the power structure of the current regime. Technological developments, on the other hand, are often oriented toward profit and change. There’s an inherent tension here. Laws may delay the development of technology and hence hurt the competitive advantage of an entrepreneur or even a state. Take the case of nanotechnology regulation in the European Union versus in the United States. European law so mitigates risks that it may end up limiting the technology’s potential, losing its competitive edge against the US. That’s another fact about the law: slow and reactive, it can be a gross annoyance. But ever since technological advances began speeding along on an exponential curve last century, the law has played a critical role in helping societies maintain certain previously negotiated standards for cohabitation. Our legal system may sometimes seem antiquated in today’s fast-moving world. But before changing our laws to accommodate new technologies that may (re)define our lives, it is important to have room for debate and time for social struggles to take place. The law serves this function of creative friction. It can restore human agency against fierce technological development. Given all the excitement over blockchain technologies, it is probable that interested parties will soon enough seek legal recognition and state-sanctioned enforceability of smart contracts. These emerging technologies are still too new to have been subjected to a sufficiently thorough analysis of their social, economic and political implications. More time is also needed to assess how blockchain could be deployed in a socially beneficial way. Blockchain technology seems poised to constitute an important component of tomorrow’s society. The legal system – slow-paced as it is – might be just what we need at this juncture to ensure that this new tool is deployed in a way consistent with established principles and values, with the common good at its core.::2017-05-03T06:26:38Z::Banking, Bitcoin, Blockchain, Global perspectives, Law, Technology, contract law, digital rights, smart contracts::Primavera de Filippi::Home::https://images.theconversation.com/files/167477/original/file-20170502-17260-t7ekia.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

The developers said the increased use of the Shibarium blockchain for transactions will result in a higher burn rate for the SHIB token, reducing supply. The SHIB price has risen 8.8% in the past 24 hours, in line with a broader market jump. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a measure of the wider crypto market, has rallied almost 7%. Users can now float new liquidity pools (LPs) on Shibarium, allowing traders to swap tokens on the network and earn a cut of trading fees for providing liquidity. ShibaSwap held over $25 million in locked tokens as of Thursday, data shows, with $1.7 million in trading volumes in the past 24 hours. “The more transactions will run on Shibarium blockchain, the more the protocol will burn base gas fees which will impact the overall burn rate of $SHIB,” they said. Burns refer to the permanent removal of tokens from circulating supply by sending them to an address that no one controls. Every swap and stake on ShibaSwap contributes to the ecosystem's growth as increased trading volumes bring higher fees for stakers and LP providers, developers said in an X post.

511::https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-halving-impact-on-layer-2s::Blockworks::article::How will the Bitcoin halving impact Bitcoin L2s?::Bitcoin will likely grow to rely on its layer-2 infrastructure a lot more for most post-halving transactions this year, experts say.::Bitcoin will likely grow to rely on its layer-2 infrastructure for most post-halving transactions this year, experts say Artwork by Crystal Le The Bitcoin halving is anticipated to occur in the second half of April this year. Like real-world gold, bitcoin is considered by many to be “digital gold,” with a maximum supply of 21 million coins. As the Bitcoin halving draws near, many are concerned that miners will endure an inevitable revenue cut following the major event. Mining bitcoin has previously been a profitable way for people to earn rewards while simultaneously securing the network. Fisher Yu is the co-founder of Babylon, a project aiming to create a Bitcoin-secured proof-of-stake economy. He noted the motivation behind early participation in Bitcoin’s proof-of-work security, attributing it to the high amount of bitcoin rewards available when the blockchain was first created. “Nakamoto’s hope is that, over time, Bitcoin becomes very well adopted so that the increase in transaction fee will outrun the reduction in mining rewards, so that miners’ operational costs are well covered,” Yu said. Read more: Why most bitcoin mining stocks are down amid a persistent crypto rally Although such a trend is observed, Yu notes that existing transaction fees are not quite sufficient, and there are growing concerns that miners may leave the network, reducing the blockchain’s overall security. This belief is shared by Max Chamberlin, the founder of next-gen EVM and layer-2 for Bitcoin, Bitfinity, who noted that many bitcoin mining businesses could become unsustainable following the halving. “While bitcoin’s mining difficulty is dynamic, automatically adjusting to the current hash rate capabilities, it would still be better for the network’s decentralization to have as many miners as possible,” Chamberlin said. Read more: 20% of bitcoin network hash rate could go offline after halving: Galaxy He notes that the emergence of Bitcoin Ordinals has boosted on-chain activity significantly and provided miners with a considerable new stream of income through transaction fees, which have so far amounted to almost $240 million. “In a broader sense, the introduction of ordinals and Runes has sparked considerable excitement within the cryptocurrency community in general, introducing a novel category of tokens — assets that exist directly on the Bitcoin blockchain,” Chamberlin said. Despite this, Chamberlin is aware that the Bitcoin ecosystem still needs to work on developing broad-spectrum, general-purpose applications, a challenge that stems primarily from the constraints of Bitcoin’s programming language, Script. “This predicament echoes a longstanding conundrum in finance — the emergence of new assets begs the question of what to do with them,” he said. Read more: The history of Bitcoin halvings — and why this time might look different He remarks that a potential solution to this concern is to integrate assets into DeFi services through Bitcoin layer-2 solutions, which often enable a more complex ecosystem of decentralized applications. “Bitfinity, a next-gen EVM serving as a layer-2 for Bitcoin and other assets, emerges as a strong contender in this regard. It provides developers with the familiar EVM programming environment but with access to Runes and other Bitcoin-native assets,” Chamberlin said. Yu agrees and explains that Babylon’s Bitcoin staking protocol could alleviate some of the growing concerns around cut rewards. He notes that miners could use their bitcoin to secure its proof-of-stake economy and be rewarded for their security. Read more: Let’s talk Bitcoin staking: Babylon’s litepaper Rena Shah shares this sentiment. Shah is the vice president of products and operations at Trust Machines, a company that is building a decentralized economy on Bitcoin. She told Blockworks that Bitcoin will likely grow to rely on its layer-2 infrastructure a lot more for most post-halving transactions this year. “While the base layer will still focus on high-value settlements, Bitcoin DeFi and other activities will no longer have to use the base layer, as more [layer-2s] start unlocking frictionless usability,” she said. She added that “solving transaction times, identity solutions and even wallet functionality between the [layer-1] and [layer-2s] are areas our team at Trust Machines has identified as most appealing to users. As well as DeFi opportunities, which are of particular interest to users of other smart contract-based chains.” Updated April 3, 2024 at 4:29 pm ET: Clarified to convey that references to “Bitfinity” are unrelated to Binance’s Bitfinity payments company.

And learn how to avoid falling prey to scams.::“Invest in crypto,” – more and more people advice that nowadays. But is it easy to choose the best crypto to invest in? When many options are available, how do you choose between them? Several factors must be considered when deciding which cryptocurrency to invest in. It can be challenging to navigate, given the vast variety of available currencies. To help you find answers to this question, we have put together this guide. Monitoring current market capitalization is one technique to decide which crypto to invest in next. This will not only show which cryptos are ranked the highest right now but also the curve of their value.Keep track of global events that have an impact on cryptocurrency pricing. For instance, Elon Musk’s purchase of the social media site Twitter affected the price of other cryptocurrencies. Certain events make some cryptocurrencies more volatile than others do. Consider this when you decide – it can be both a pro and con. The cryptocurrency’s utility, or practical value, is an essential element that can significantly affect its value. In simple terms, if a cryptocurrency has more useful functions, it is likely to be more valuable. Conversely, if its use cases decrease, its value is likely to follow suit. Identifying the most promising use cases and those with the most market traction are crucial for making informed investment decisions. A cryptocurrency with a wide range of potential use cases, or those that have gained significant traction in the market, can be a positive sign for the investment portfolio. However, it is worth noting that the regulatory landscape of cryptocurrencies is constantly evolving. New regulations and restrictions can limit the use of cryptocurrencies. Therefore, staying informed about the regulatory environment is crucial for informed investment decisions in the dynamic cryptocurrency market. In summary, understanding the utility of a cryptocurrency is essential when deciding which crypto to invest in. Investing in a crypto with high-quality use cases or the potential for new ones can be a positive sign for your investment portfolio. However, staying up to date with the regulatory environment is equally important in making informed investment decisions in the crypto market. Always check whether the cryptocurrency you are thinking about investing in has a white paper. The coin, its uses, and its goals are covered in detail in the white paper, along with the technology that supports it. This will not only provide you with crucial details about the currency, but also reassure you of its genuineness. Generally, it is critical to pay close attention to the legitimacy of currencies and brokers in the current crypto market. The most important, the white paper on cryptocurrency is a vital document that investors need to examine before investing. It provides transparency, outlines the project’s goals and technical specifications, and explains the cryptocurrency use case. Without white papers, investors do not have the information they need to make informed investment decisions. It is crucial to assess whether a specific cryptocurrency has limited supply. Understanding the current number of coins in circulation and the extent to which they can be created through mining are equally important. These factors can impact the price of cryptocurrencies in the long term. An excellent illustration of this concept is that of Bitcoin. Bitcoin has a finite number of available coins, making it a valuable commodity as more people invest in it. An increase in demand for Bitcoin increases its value. However, if the demand remains the same, the value will change once there are no more bitcoins to mine. Therefore, it is essential to keep an eye on the supply and demand factors of cryptocurrencies to make informed investment decisions. To elaborate further, the limited supply of Bitcoin makes it a valuable asset. The Bitcoin mining process involves solving complex mathematical equations, which results in the creation of new coins. However, a finite number of coins can be created with a maximum of 21 million bitcoins in circulation. Once all 21 million Bitcoins are in circulation, no more can be created, and the only way to obtain Bitcoin is to buy it on exchange. This limited supply of Bitcoin makes it valuable, as the demand for Bitcoin increases with a growing number of investors. Consequently, the price of Bitcoin has increased dramatically over the years, making it a popular investment asset. Understanding supply and demand factors is vital when you want to invest in crypto.

Share this article US President candidate Donald Trump plans to offer his non-fungible token (NFT) community access to an exclusive NFT collection minted as Bitcoin Ordinals, according to a recent tweet from CollectTrumpCards, a Twitter handle for Trump’s NFTs. TRUMP DIGITAL TRADING CARDS on BITCOIN ORDINALS 🟧 The FIRST EVER Trump Trading Cards on Bitcoin. Read this thread ⬇️ — CollectTrumpCards (@CollectTrump) January 18, 2024 The new collection, limited to only 200 NFTs, is available to the first 200 buyers of the “Mugshot Edition” NFT collection, released in December 2023. Each mugshot NFT is priced at $99. CollectTrumpCards said that only 99 of these exclusive NFTs remain available for purchase, with transactions conducted in Wrapped Ether (WETH) via the platform CollectTrumpCards.com. 4. Of the 200, only 99 are left to purchase with Crypto (WETH) on https://t.co/vrpHbxyrFG (And if you’re one of the 101 that already Purchased, You'll get your Ordinal!). — CollectTrumpCards (@CollectTrump) January 18, 2024 The company noted that these NFTs, including the “Mugshot Edition,” are intended solely for collection purposes and should not be seen as investment opportunities or political statements. Moreover, all Mugshot NFTs are restricted from trading until December 31, 2024. The “Mugshot Edition” has a unique theme centered around Trump’s life and career, including a photograph from his arrest in late August. This collection not only offers a glimpse into these personal moments but also provides exclusive opportunities for fans. Buyers who purchase at least 47 Trump cards will have the chance to attend a dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago and receive a piece of the suit he wore during his arrest. Some of these NFTs might even bear Trump’s signature. Before launching the Mugshot NFTs, Trump had introduced two other NFT collections, which were sold out and generated massive revenue. According to a report by the legal advocacy group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, Trump’s holdings in Ethereum, primarily accumulated from these NFT sales, were valued at $5 million.

514::https://theconversation.com/blockchain-is-useful-for-a-lot-more-than-just-bitcoin-58921::The Conversation::article::Blockchain is useful for a lot more than just Bitcoin::While Bitcoin gets all the attention, the blockchain technology it’s based on could have applications across business and government.::Blockchain technology is not just useful for creating digital currencies such as Bitcoin or developing new financial technologies. Blockchains can be used for a wide variety of applications, such as tracking ownership or the provenance of documents, digital assets, physical assets or voting rights. Blockchain technology was popularised by the Bitcoin digital currency system. But, essentially, a blockchain is just a special kind of database. The Bitcoin blockchain stores cryptographically signed records of financial transfers, but blockchain systems can store any kind of data. Blockchains can also store and run computer code called “smart contracts”. What makes a blockchain system special is that it doesn’t run on just one computer like a regular database. Rather, many distributed processing nodes collaborate to run it. There can be a full copy of the database on every node, and the system encourages all those nodes to establish a consensus about its contents. This boosts our confidence in the database and its contents. It’s difficult, if not impossible, to meddle with the database without others finding out and correcting it. The global consensus among the nodes about the integrity and contents of the distributed database is why it’s often called a “distributed ledger”. In our society, we normally rely on trusted third parties, such as lawyers, courts, banks and governments to process and keep authoritative records about commercial transactions. These transactions aren’t just about financial transfers, but also include the creation or transfer of physical assets, shareholdings, certifications, digital rights, intellectual property or even votes. These third parties are trusted because we rely on them. If they fail or lie, we suffer. We tend to trust the third parties for reasons that are external to the database; lawyers are accredited; votes are counted by independent monitors; and courts run to established laws for matters such as oversight and the possibility of appeal. Blockchains are interesting because the integrity of the contents of the distributed ledger does not rely on any specific individual or organisation. So, rather than relying on trusted third-party organisations to facilitate these commercial transactions, we might instead rely on a trusted blockchain system. This means blockchains give us new opportunities to rethink how parts of our society work. Innovation here might reduce friction in the economy, or create new kinds of services and ways of doing business with each other. Whether or not blockchain systems are trustworthy is an interesting question. The reasons for believing that blockchain systems won’t fail or lie would be based on our understanding of the underlying software technologies. It also depends on our understanding of market incentives that influence behaviour of the many distributed processing nodes that run blockchains. However, blockchain technologies are still new in the scheme of things, and the community is still discovering their risks, limitations and potential economic and social impact. Because blockchain technology is so new, it’s difficult to predict exactly how they will end up being used. This is why we at Data61 in CSIRO are exploring new ways blockchains can be used across industries. To understand the economic and societal opportunities presented by blockchain technology, we also need to understand its technological risks and limitations. At Data61, we plan to identify, develop and evaluate some “proof of concept” systems using blockchains to investigate them. A recent UK government report on blockchain technologies provides a good overview and examples of the use of blockchain. One of these is Everledger, a company founded by Australian woman Leanne Kemp. Everledger uses a blockchain to record information about the provenance and ownership of individual diamonds and other valuables. Here, rather than the blockchain recording transfers of digital currency, it records transfers of ownership of identified physical assets. This globally accessible provenance trail could reduce fraud and theft, and enable new or improved kinds of insurance and finance services. The same general idea could be used for any supply chain, such as in retail, agriculture or pharmaceuticals. The drivers for improving assurance of supply chain quality vary in different industries. It could be brand reputation in retail, or safety in pharmaceuticals, or a combination in agriculture. It is worth observing that blockchains don’t totally do away with the need for trusted third parties. A blockchain is only a digital record, but we need others to determine if those records actually match the corresponding physical assets in the real world. Everledger relies on major diamond certification companies to measure identifying information about individual diamonds. These measurements can be independently cross-checked. But in some sense, companies such as these become trusted third parties for this blockchain-based system. One can imagine the adoption of blockchain technologies creating opportunities for new kinds of trusted third-party organisations. Underlying all of these applications is the need for data integrity, which is the key security property for commercial systems, and the primary property for blockchain technologies. For financial transactions, data integrity means you can’t spend money you don’t have, and you can’t spend money twice. For physical supply chains, this means you can’t fraudulently acquire record of ownership for an asset. However, other security properties, such as privacy and confidentiality, are also important in many application areas. To achieve confidentiality, other mechanisms such as cryptography must be used in conjunction with the blockchain. Part of our software architecture research at Data61 is to seek to understand how design choices for software-based systems affect tradeoffs for qualities including security (integrity, confidentiality, privacy), performance (latency, throughput and scalability), and others. Good design choices can control risks to achieving these qualities, and this is part of what is evaluated in our research using proof-of-concept systems. Computer programs are a special kind of data and so can be stored in a database. That means we can store programs in the distributed ledger of a blockchain system, and execute those programs while later transactions are being processed. In the Ethereum blockchain, these programs can be highly complex. These programs are normally called “smart contracts”. Smart contracts can carry value, and can conditionally transfer that value according to complex business conditions based on the latest state of the distributed ledger. This means blockchain systems can do more than store information about commercial transactions; they can also process commercial transactions too. This greatly expands the opportunities for using blockchain systems. Although smart contracts are often thought of as standing for self-executing legal contracts, they are written in a general purpose programming language and can be used to implement a wide range of business logic. Can smart contracts actually stand as legal contracts? This is an interesting question. For legal contracts to be enforceable, they need to be understandable by reasonable persons. Can the bytecode of a program stored on a blockchain really be understood by any human? Perhaps only obsessive hobbyists might be able to develop that skill! Another thread of research in Data61 is investigating new ways of representing and analysing smart contracts, using recent results from legal informatics. Blockchain technology is still in its infancy. There are a wide range of plausible future scenarios for their future impact, ranging from efficiency improvements for commercial transactions through to a complete reinvention of the economy. As with any disruptive technology, understanding the plausible, possible and probable impacts – the opportunities and risks – will be vital for wise policy, strategy, and design choices by Australian governments and companies.::2016-05-09T20:04:28Z::Bitcoin, Blockchain, Finance, Fintech, contract law::Mark Staples::Home::https://images.theconversation.com/files/121656/original/image-20160509-23367-kxbc3k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=345%2C0%2C2178%2C1059&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

The softer-than-expected U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.3% versus 0.4% in March amid economist forecasts for 0.4%, triggering a breakout for BTC. The asset regained the $66,000 mark for the first time since April and posted its biggest single-day gain since March. Such a move, coupled with demand from traditional finance, could see bitcoin regaining its March record of $73,700. “We expect bullish momentum here that could take us back to the highs of nearly $74,000,” QCP traders said. “The desk saw sizeable buyers of $100K-$120k BTC Calls for Dec 2024 on this move higher in spot.” “Institutional demand for bitcoin continues to grow, with large asset managers Millennium and Schonfeld investing approximately 3% and 2% of their AUM into the BTC spot ETF,” they added. Multiple filings on Wednesday showed that several big-name funds, such as Millenium Management and Elliot Capital, held millions worth of bitcoin ETFs in their portfolios. Meanwhile, some analysts say the selling pressure on bitcoin appears to have eased off, citing on-chain and exchange data. “Short-term Bitcoin holders are selling at basically zero profit and traders are depleting their unrealized profits in the last few months,” CryptoQuant analysts shared in a Thursday report. “Bitcoin balances at OTC desks stabilizing, which suggests there is less Bitcoin supply coming into the market to sell via these entities.” The firm defines short-term traders as addresses that hold bitcoin for less than 155 days and are likely to capitalize on short-term price movements. A breakout in bitcoin comes after weeks of low volatility. Since March, the market has been range-bound between $60,000 and $70,000, with the halving event in April not providing the expected boost due to a general lack of market catalysts, traders have previously said. Higher risk appetite for token bets showed signs of beginning earlier this week after an X post by retail trader Keith Gill sent some meme stocks and meme coins surging. Gill's online persona and investment strategies contributed to a short squeeze on video game retailer GameStop’s stock in 2021, and his first post on social application X in three years was considered by some to be a sign of market volatility in the months ahead.

516::https://beincrypto.com/altcoin-listing-korea-largest-crypto-exchange/::BeInCrypto::article::The Largest Crypto Exchange in Korea Listed These Two Altcoins::Korea's largest crypto exchange, lists two altcoins, driving notable market gains and showcasing innovative blockchain solutions.::We use cookies to improve your experience.  Upbit, the titan of South Korea’s cryptocurrency exchange market, has once again made headlines. This time, it is for listing two notable altcoins, Altlayer (ALT) and Pyth Network (PYTH). These additions to the Korean Won (KRW) and Bitcoin (BTC) markets have stirred significant interest and speculation among investors and crypto aficionados. At 09:00 UTC on February 27, 2024, ALT’s BTC pair entered the Upbit market. Upbit has decided to support ALT exclusively on the Ethereum network for deposits. With this decision, the exchange aims to offer a streamlined and secure trading environment. Moreover, it is important to note that this ALT is distinct from ArchLoot (ALT), which is traded on other platforms. Similarly, Pyth Network (PYTH) was listed against the KRW and BTC trading pairs, with its trading kicking off alongside ALT. By supporting PYTH through the Solana network, Upbit underlines its dedication to facilitating reliable transactions. Upbit has implemented specific guidelines and limitations to ensure market stability. For instance, initial buy orders are closely regulated, with predetermined thresholds for sell orders. These measures aim to prevent market manipulation and excessive volatility. Therefore, they reflect Upbit’s proactive approach to safeguarding its trading environment. The inclusion of ALT and PYTH highlights the potential of these altcoins. ALT, with its Rollup as a Service (RaaS) and Actively Validated Service (AVS infrastructure), offers a new paradigm for projects aiming to develop rollups without deep blockchain knowledge. Meanwhile, PYTH is pioneering by connecting off-chain financial data with on-chain Dapps, enriching the DeFi ecosystem. The market’s response to these listings has been overwhelmingly positive. For example, PYTH saw a surge of over 40% on the announcement day and an overall rally of more than 110% in February. ALT also demonstrated strong performance, with a 25% increase on the day of listing and an 80% rally within the month. “PYTH is moving as planned. I guess we’re definitely smashing above a dollar sooner than I expected,” DeFi analyst Dave Spike said. Read more: 13 Best Altcoins To Invest In February 2024 These trends reflect the significant impact Upbit’s listings can have on crypto asset valuations. However, amidst the excitement, a word of caution remains relevant. The crypto market’s inherent volatility, speculative demand, and regulatory shifts present risks that investors must consider carefully.

517::https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-halving-inflation-and-issuance-schedule::Blockworks::article::Why is 2140 the end of bitcoin inflation?::The final Bitcoin halving, where the mining reward becomes smaller than one satoshi, is expected to occur in 2140.::The final Bitcoin halving, where the mining reward becomes smaller than one satoshi, is expected to occur in 2140 Artwork by Crystal Le It’s well known that the Bitcoin network experiences a halving of supply approximately every four years. Less appreciated is that these are set to continue for over a century into the future. Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto programmed the year 2140 — 30 halvings from now — as the year that the block rewards (the subsidy paid to miners for processing transactions into blocks) would drop to less than one satoshi, the smallest unit of bitcoin. The use of the term “satoshi” — equivalent to 100 millionth of a bitcoin (or 0.00000001 BTC) — emerged organically among early Bitcoin users and developers, appearing in various forums and discussions starting in 2010 or 2011, and became widely accepted in 2013. Read more: The Bitcoin halving is about a month away — here’s what you can expect The halving is modeled after the physical mining of scarce resources, according to Jameson Lopp, co-founder and chief security officer at Casa. “There’s nothing special about the year 2140,” Lopp told Blockworks. “It’s just how the nature of halvings along with the level of precision of satoshis ended up working out.” Lopp notes that Nakamoto explained the supply schedule to Mike Hearn, a former Google engineer who became an early Bitcoin contributor, in 2009: “My choice for the number of coins and distribution schedule was an educated guess,” Satoshi wrote. “I wanted to pick something that would make prices similar to existing currencies, but without knowing the future, that’s very hard.” Read more: Satoshi warned against labeling bitcoin as an ‘investment’ He picked 21 million, but Satoshi added that the divisibility of a bitcoin in practice could be represented differently depending on how valuable one bitcoin gets. “For example, if 0.001 is worth one euro, then it might be easier to change where the decimal point is displayed, so if you had one bitcoin it’s now displayed as 1000, and 0.001 is displayed as one.” For what it’s worth, 0.001 BTC is worth about 65 euros (approximately $70) today. Why the rate of issuance would decline for 132 years, however, was never explained. “I expect it was more of a ‘better safe than sorry’ decision to give the system decades to bootstrap,” Lopp said. Unless the price of bitcoin (BTC) doubles every four years, each halving brings less income from block rewards to miners. So to maintain the network’s hashrate, which is important for Bitcoin’s security, transaction fees will become more important over time. Whether that will happen in practice remains to be seen, but Lopp is optimistic. “I expect that as we see the multi-layered Bitcoin ecosystem continue to expand, the base chain will start to look more and more like a high-value cryptographic accumulator and it will make economic sense for on-chain transactions to pay relatively high fees,” he said.

518::https://coinatory.com/cryptocurrency-articles/crypto-lending-crypto-loans-7118/::Coinatory::article::Crypto lending - All you need to know about crypto loans::Looking to learn about crypto lending and how to profit from it? Discover what crypto lending is, how it works, and how you can earn money from it!::Crypto lending is the act of depositing cryptocurrency to be lent to borrowers in exchange for recurrent interest payment. Payments are made in the form of cryptocurrency, which is commonly deposited and compounded every day, every week, or every month. Decentralized and centralized crypto lenders are the two primary categories of crypto lending platforms. Both provide access to high interest rates, often as high as 20% annual percentage yield (APY), and both typically need depositing collateral in order to get a crypto loan. The opportunity to lend out cryptocurrency and earn interest in the form of cryptocurrency incentives is made available through cryptocurrency lending platforms for investors. In 2020, lending platforms gained popularity, and since then, the total value of loans locked on different platforms has increased to billions. There are two parts to cryptocurrency lending: interest-bearing deposits and loans. Similar to a bank account, deposit accounts have similar functions. The lending platform accepts cryptocurrency deposits from users and pays interest of up to 8% APY (depending on the platform and the cryptocurrency). Deposited money might be used by the platform to make loans to borrowers or for other kinds of investments. In order to borrow money or cryptocurrency, borrowers normally have to deposit at least 100% (and sometimes up to 150%, depending on the lender) in cryptocurrency as collateral. The interest rates differ by platform and require for monthly payments, much like with traditional loans. In contrast to conventional loans, cryptocurrency loans have durations as short as seven days and as long as 180 days, with an hourly interest rate, like Binance. Some lenders, like Nexo, which offers 0% APR, provide an endless line of credit in their place. There are several types of cryptocurrency loans available: Some services provide a cryptocurrency line of credit rather than a standard loan with a defined term length. Users can borrow up to a specific amount of the deposited collateral using this kind of collateralized loan, but there are no specified terms for repayment, and they just pay interest on the money they withdraw. Collateralized loans are the most popular and require deposited cryptocurrency that is used as collateral for the loan. The majority of platforms demand overcollateralization, which limits how much of the deposited collateral borrowers can access (usually below a 90% loan-to-value). The interest rate and the likelihood of having your margin called are both lower the lower the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. Flash loans are typically available on crypto exchanges and are instant loans that are borrowed and repaid in the same transaction. These are very high-risk loans that are typically used to take advantage of market arbitrage opportunities, such as buying cryptocurrency for a lower price in one market and instantly selling for a higher price in another, all within the same transaction Uncollateralized loans are not as popular, but they function similarly to personal loans. Borrowers must fill out a loan application, pass identity verification, and complete a creditworthiness review to be approved. These loans have a higher risk of loss for lenders because there is no collateral to liquidate in the event of a loan default. Due to the loans’ and deposited funds’ dependence on the constantly erratic cryptocurrency market, lending in the cryptocurrency space is inherently dangerous for both borrowers and lenders. Crypto aficionados are less than thrilled as a result of the recent Celsius fiasco, which resulted in the overnight freezing of billions of dollars in deposits. Here are a few of the risks of crypto lending: Though some crypto loans offer low rates, most crypto loans charge over 5% APR, with some charging up to 13% APR (or more). Crypto assets often become unaccessible and illiquid when they are deposited onto crypto loan services. While some cryptocurrency lending services permit lenders to access deposited funds reasonably quickly, others may necessitate a protracted waiting period. A decrease in the value of the deposited collateral might result in a margin call when customers pledge collateral and borrow against it. When the LTV of a cryptocurrency loan falls below the agreed-upon rate, this occurs. When this occurs, borrowers have two options: they can either add more collateral to bring the LTV back down or they can risk liquidation. Platforms for crypto lending are unregulated and do not provide the same level of protection that banks do. For instance, user money up to that amount are safeguarded in the event that a bank goes bankrupt since U.S. bank deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for up to $250,000 per depositor. There are no user protections for cryptocurrency lending platforms that have solvency problems, and money may be lost. Users must register for a centralized lending platform (like BlockFi) or link a digital wallet to a decentralized lending platform in order to submit an application for a cryptocurrency loan (such as Aave). Users will next choose the type of loan and the desired loan amount before choosing the collateral to deposit. The amount that is available will change depending on the collateral and deposit. The borrowed cash will quickly move to the user’s account or digital wallet after the user deposits the collateral into the platform’s digital wallet. The majority of loans give quick approval, and smart contracts are used to lock in loan conditions. Users must register for a lending platform, choose a supported cryptocurrency to deposit, then pay money to the platform in order to become a crypto lender. Interest can be paid in kind or with the native platform token on a centralized crypto lending platform. Interest is paid out in kind on a decentralized exchange, but there may also be bonus payments. Lending cryptocurrency is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, the majority of loans are secured by collateral, so even in the case of a default, lenders can recover their losses through liquidation. In comparison to conventional bank accounts, they also offer deposits at substantially greater interest rates. On the other hand, there are no legal safeguards for investors, giving lending companies the authority to arbitrarily lock consumers’ funds in place, as Celsius has done. Borrowers run the danger of collateral losing value and having to be liquidated, which would result in a substantially smaller return on their investment. Regulators from all around the world are focusing on lending platforms; rules are emerging around deposit accounts, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) even fined BlockFi $100 million for breaking securities laws. Ultimately, crypto lending can be secure for careful users, but both borrowers and investors face significant dangers. A platform that provides lending and borrowing services that are controlled by smart contracts is known as decentralized finance (DeFi) lending. Decentralized apps (dApps) enable customers to link a digital wallet, deposit collateral, and instantly access funds. DeFi loans are instantaneous. DeFi lending enables customers to deposit cryptocurrency using a digital wallet and begin earning interest right away, with the interest often compounding every minute. The majority of DeFi lending platforms mandate overcollateralization, requiring deposits of at least 110% of the loan amount. The deposit of collateral receives income even when it is tied to a loan, which is how DeFi differs from centralized systems. Users can earn a large amount of interest on their crypto deposits when they make them on a lending platform, often more than they can at regular banks. The money that is deposited is loaned to borrowers who cover a portion of the interest, and it can also be invested in other ways to increase yield.

Share this article With Ordinals taking center stage, Bitcoin dominated the NFT market last month, accounting for more than half of the overall monthly NFT sales. According to data from CryptoSlam, Bitcoin NFT sales surged to a record high of over $880 million in December, outpacing major platforms like Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon. The number of buyers and sellers skyrocketed by 140%, with over 9,000 buyers and 10,000 sellers joining the market. While Bitcoin dominated, Ethereum experienced a decline in NFT sales, dropping by 15.57% to reach $350 million. In contrast, Solana also saw a remarkable 250% growth, though its total sales still trailed those of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Arbitrum also showcased significant growth, with a 180% surge in NFT sales. The most valuable NFT sold was Van Gogh’s Painting #216, fetching $1.19 million. This NFT is part of a Bitcoin-powered NFT collection created to pay tribute to the renowned artist. Two other artworks from the same collection, #132 and #283, were sold earlier for $1.3 million and $1.27 million, respectively. Overall, while global NFT sales surpassed $1.7 billion last month, this volume remains significantly below its peak of $5.5 billion back in August 2021. Ordinals have played an essential role in the recent surge in Bitcoin’s NFT sales. Introduced in September 2022, this new technology allows users to inscribe digital items, including images, videos, and music, directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain. BitMEX reported over 13,000 Ordinals transactions were processed within the first two months, consuming 526MB of Bitcoin blockspace. Advocates such as Bitcoin developer Udi Wertheimer or MicroStrategy’s co-founder Michael Saylor champion Ordinals for boosting Bitcoin’s sustainability. However, not all Bitcoin community members agree. Luke Dashjr, a Bitcoin Core developer, argues that these inscriptions exploit a vulnerability in the data size limit, potentially leading to network spam.

520::https://theconversation.com/centrelink-data-matching-problems-show-the-need-for-a-government-blockchain-71156::The Conversation::article::Centrelink data-matching problems show the need for a government blockchain::The problems with Centrelink’s data-matching system stem from reconciling datasets held by different agencies. What if we used a blockchain to create a single source of data?::Governments across the globe are experimenting with the blockchain, the technology behind Bitcoin, as a way to reduce costs and provide more accountability to the public. In Europe alone, the United Kingdom, Ukraine and Estonia are experimenting with blockchains to fight corruption and deliver public services. Australia, too, is looking at what a blockchain might achieve. The recent problems with Centrelink’s automated data-matching system show precisely where a government blockchain would fit in. Rather than siloing our data in government agencies, we could create a single source of information. This would speed up our interactions with government, while reducing errors and fraud. The blockchain is a kind of public database, one stored simultaneously on a bunch of different computers. When a new transaction occurs it is verified (otherwise known as “mining” or “consensus”), encrypted and added to the database. The most famous example of the blockchain is Bitcoin, a crypto-currency built upon the blockchain. However, the blockchain is suitable for many other applications, not just financial transactions. For example, the blockchain could be used to authenticate that a diamond has not come from an illict source, or for buying and selling property. For the government’s purposes, the killer feature of the blockchain is that it is a way to record transactions so that they are transparent and cannot be altered or tampered with. When used to track fish through a supply chain, for instance, it allows customers and restaurants to follow where the fish has been and have confidence in the data. When applied to a government context, these capabilities could be useful for collecting tax, delivering benefits, or regulating business. From the public’s point of view, this could enable us to track government spending, eliminate fraudulent transactions, reduce errors in data processing and speed up service delivery to almost real time. It could be useful almost anywhere records are kept. All the while the public could be more confident about the accuracy and integrity of the data being held. The Australian government makes benefit payments and provides support services through Medicare, Centrelink and Child Support services. It also collects information through numerous other agencies, such as the Australian Tax Office. A government blockchain could record the transactions about a citizen and link together information about health, welfare and child support. The information would be entered only once into the blockchain by any one of these agencies. There would be no need for the data to be re-entered or matched again. Thus errors that occur in data processing as information is passed on down the line will be eliminated, avoiding some of the issues with the current Centrelink system. Further, once data is entered it cannot be altered or changed in any way without proper authentication. Any authorised officer within the government could then access the information in the blockchain, avoiding a paper-pushing exercise between government departments. All of your data would be in one place. We could go even further, as the blockchain would also allow other services to be processed through an app, as the UK is trialling with welfare payments. The overall cost savings, reduction in bureaucracy and increased responsiveness to helping people in need could be immense. All we need is the government to invest in its own blockchain. The essence of a blockchain is to reduce the reliance on centralised systems (such as the government), replacing it with a system with inherent accountability, transparency and trust. The original blockchain concept achieved this by being open, like the internet (also known as unpermissioned), relying on independent, anonymous “miners” to validate transactions. This guarantees the integrity of the data as no-one knows who the miners are to bribe or bully them into underhanded actions. However, some might view a government-run, “permissioned” blockchain with suspicion. The trust of the public would need to be gained. A government blockchain would not be open, and we would have to rely on the government to approve all of the transactions. This negates some of the benefit offered by a blockchain. The legitimacy and trust would have to come from the government itself. Thus a government-run blockchain would not be without its challenges. But if an Australian government blockchain is developed and allowed to succeed, then the potential benefits could be enormous. Society as we know it will be disrupted!::2017-01-13T05:07:21Z::Blockchain, Centrelink, Data matching, Digital governance, Government data, Medicare::Christine Helliar::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/152614/original/image-20170113-11198-1htvjsm.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C85%2C2995%2C1455&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
521::https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/16/ether-bitcoin-ratio-slides-to-lowest-since-april-2021-heres-why/::CoinDesk::article::Ether-Bitcoin Ratio Slides to Lowest Since April 2021. Here's Why::"Ether is a 'lightning rod' for negative sentiment from crypto native and external players and has several weak spots," one observer said.::The ratio between ether (ETH) and bitcoin’s (BTC) dollar-denominated prices continues to slide, extending year-to-date losses as suggested by the bearish death cross pattern a month ago. ETH/BTC slipped to 0.04563 on crypto exchange Binance soon before press time, reaching the lowest since April 2021, according to charting platform TradingView. This year, the ratio has declined nearly 16%, indicating a bias for bitcoin or the leading cryptocurrency by market value. The slide to three-year lows follows reduced demand for exchange-traded products (ETPs) tied to ether. According to Bloomberg data quoted by ETC Group in its weekly report, global ether ETPs registered net outflows of around $63.5 million last week, with Hong Kong-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) losing the most. Meanwhile, bitcoin ETPs raked in $92.5 million last week. Several factors, including competing layer 1s and lingering uncertainty about the debut of spot ETH approvals in the U.S, are likely responsible for ETH falling out of investor favor. “The approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has reinforced bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative and its status as a macro asset. On the other hand, open questions about ETH’s fundamental positioning within the crypto sector remain. Competing layer-1s (L1s) like Solana detract from Ethereum’s positioning as the 'go-to' network for decentralized app (dApp) deployment,” Coinbase Institutional’s Research analyst David Han said in a note Wednesday. Solana’s share in total decentralized exchange volumes has grown tenfold from 2% to 21% in one year, eating into Ethereum's market share. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) green-lighted nearly a dozen spot BTC ETFs in January. Since then, these funds have drawn roughly $12 billion in net inflows, according to data source Farside Investors. Approval of spot ETFs tied to ether will open a similar pool of capital for Ethereum’s native token, although it’s unclear when the SEC will approve it. Traders on decentralized betting platform Polymarket see just a 10% chance of the SEC approving a spot ETF on or before May 31. The regulator has until May 23 to decide whether to approve or reject VanEck’s application to launch a spot Ethereum ETF. The deadline for BlackRock’s application is June 23. According to finance lawyer Scott Johnsson, the SEC is looking for reasons to deny ETH ETF applications by BlackRock and others on grounds that they have been improperly filed as commodity-based trust shares and do not qualify if they hold a security. Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex Solutions, said ether is a "lightning rod" for negative sentiment from crypto native and external players and has several weak spots. “Capital gets fragmented. There are proportionally greater numbers of ways to get exposure to the ecosystem through the many Layer 2s tokens (OP, ARB…) and native protocol tokens in each one. The capital gets fragmented," Solot said in an email. Solot added that strong anti-ETH sentiment from [rival] Solana community and Bitcoin propounders is driving negative ether narratives and the high beta cryptocurrency is a "perfect vehicle" for external players to express bearish view given it trades on traditional exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Lastly, Ether recently turned inflationary, reversing the bullish deflationary supply trend seen consistently since its parent network Ethereum transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus ecosystem in September 2022.

523::https://blockworks.co/news/mining-firms-prepare-for-bitcoin-halving::Blockworks::article::The Bitcoin halving is just weeks away — here’s how miners have prepared::Public mining companies have been acquiring sites, refreshing machine fleets and diversifying business models in preparation for the event.::Public mining companies have been acquiring sites, refreshing machine fleets and diversifying business models in preparation for the event Konstantin Yolshin/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks Mining companies are bracing themselves for the Bitcoin halving — a time expected to weed out the segment’s less efficient operators, and those with trouble accessing capital. Per-block mining rewards are set to drop from 6.25 bitcoin (BTC) to 3.125 BTC on or around April 20. Such an event occurs roughly every four years. Read more: The next Bitcoin halving is coming. Here’s what you need to know While some industry players are expected to struggle, other firms have made it clear they intend to take advantage of buying opportunities and set themselves up for future growth. Such vision takes preparation, and miner moves have been aplenty in recent months. While some miners have already started acquiring properties, others have focused on buying new and more efficient machines. Cutting costs and diversifying revenue sources has been another strategy used by various companies. Let’s take a deeper look. While a bunch of the larger mining companies have signaled the intent to be opportunistic in a post-halving world, some have already started to buy properties. Compass Point research and trading analyst Joe Flynn has referred to Marathon Digital as “the 800-pound gorilla” in the mining space. Indeed, the company sported an energized hash rate of 28.7 exahashes per second (EH/s) as of Feb. 29, and has no plans to slow down. The company closed its acquisition of two mining facilities in Texas and Nebraska in January. Marathon more recently revealed its intent to buy a Texas bitcoin mining facility owned by Applied Digital for roughly $87 million. CleanSpark has also bought facilities this year — completing its acquisition of three data centers in Mississippi last month. The purchases — as part of a $19.8 million cash deal — were set to expand CleanSpark’s operating hash rate by 2.4 EH/s. Bitfarms bought land in Yguazu, Paraguay in January for a planned 100 megawatt (MW) facility. Near the Itaipú Dam, the facility — to boost Bitfarms’ portfolio of “low-cost renewable hydropower” — is set to be completed in the second half of 2024, the company said at the time. Buying mining machines was a trend in 2023, as a dozen or so public mining companies committed more than $1 billion in purchase orders, according to BlocksBridge Consulting data. Read more: Crypto miners keep busy ahead of halving with accelerated machine buys Among the larger purchases was Riot Platforms’ buy of 66,560 MicroBT machines for $290.5 million in December — amounting to 18 EH/s of mining capacity. Riot then bought 31,500 more miners from MicroBT last month, for $97.4 million. About 17,000 of those machines were set to replace “under-performing” miners in its Rockdale, TX facility, Riot CEO Jason Les said at the time. Others have followed suit with acquiring and deploying new machines that improve the company’s mining efficiency. Bitfarms revealed in November it had ordered 35,888 Bitmain T21 miners as part of a so-called “transformative fleet upgrade” — with deliveries slated between March and May. The company then agreed to buy nearly 52,000 more machines earlier this month. “Securing these miners now is a key part of our strategy to drive rapid and meaningful improvements across our three key operating metrics of hashrate, energy efficiency and operating costs per terahash with a plan to capture greater upside from rising bitcoin prices with rapidly expanding mining margins,” Bitfarms CEO Geoff Morphy said in a statement. The latest Bitfarms purchase came just days after the company said it planned to sell common shares of the company to gain proceeds of up to $375 million. Bitmain agreed to invest $53 million in Core Scientific in September ahead of Core’s emergence out of bankruptcy in January. That Bitmain deal was set to supply the mining company with 27,000 Bitmain S19J bitcoin mining servers — totaling 4.1 EH/s of hash rate. Core Scientific said earlier this month that it completed the payments due in 2024 for its S19J and S21 machines. CleanSpark bought 4.4 EH/s worth of Antminer machines in October, while New York-based Cipher Mining purchased 16,700 Avalon A1466 miners from Canaan in January. Most recently, Singapore-headquartered Bitdeer said Tuesday it was set to install new SEALMINER A1 miners as part of an initial 3.4 EH/s expansion in Texas and Norway. The company said it would be retiring older mining rigs as part of the upgrade. While growth is critical, not all miners are seeking to expand at all costs. Just ask Hut 8. The company merged with US Bitcoin Corp. in November. It then named US Bitcoin Corp. co-founder Asher Genoot as Hut 8’s new CEO, replacing Jaime Leverton. Hut 8 said earlier this month it would cease mining operations at its Drumheller site in Alberta, Canada as part of a larger effort to cut inefficiencies. “I’m going through not just every single facility, every single category of miners and every single business line, but also every single cost center,” Genoot previously told Blockworks. Read more: Hut 8 eyes growth around the Bitcoin halving — but not at all costs Diversifying revenue streams, as well as exploring new geographies, has also been a focus for some segment players. Miners have increasingly looked to support the high-performance computing (HPC) and AI sectors. Hive Digital Technologies rebranded last July as part of a pivot to HPC, while Hut 8 has said it also plans to boost its footprint in the growing AI infrastructure and computing markets in the coming years. Earlier this month, Core Scientific said it would lease up to 16 MW of capacity in its Austin data center to cloud provider CoreWeave. Possible revenue via the CoreWeave deal exceeds $100 million, the company said. Geographic diversity is also a way some miners have looked to gain an edge. Marathon Digital expanded into Abu Dhabi and Paraguay last year — and signaled it is looking into Africa as another possible spot to set up operations. Charlie Schumacher, Marathon’s vice president of corporate communications, previously told Blockworks that expanding into new regions can help improve margins and reduce concentration risk in the business. The big public miners have noted that building up balance sheet strength has been crucial as executives expect there to be more buying opportunities post-halving. Ultimately, segment observers note that bitcoin miner consolidation appears imminent. Marathon executives said during a February earnings call they would look to use the firm’s balance sheet — with roughly $1 billion worth of unrestricted cash and bitcoin, as of Jan. 31 — to nearly double the firm’s hash rate to 50 EH/s by the end of 2025. Read more: Marathon Digital ready to deploy ‘dry powder’ in push to double hash rate Riot Platforms ended 2023 with $597 million in cash on its balance sheet, and held 8,067 BTC at the end of February — worth roughly $550 million. The company intends to use that capital to help it reach 38 EH/s by the end of 2025, Riot executives note. Core Scientific CEO Adam Sullivan told Blockworks that the company is set to focus on opportunistically buying machines from struggling miners unable to afford parts of their existing orders after the halving. Read more: Core Scientific CEO: Machine buys, deleveraging key around Bitcoin halving While Hut 8’s Genoot said the firm will look to invest in growth going forward, its decision to build scale or buy scale will depend in part on cost. The company’s recently announced 63 MW build-out in Texas was expected to cost $275,000 per megawatt — roughly 40% less than the roughly $460,000 per megawatt that Marathon spent on two mining facilities in December. “We’re very active in the M&A markets, but we’re also very cost-conscious,” Genoot said previously. “We’re not going to overpay because we know what the cost is to develop ourselves as well, so we’re running both in parallel very aggressively.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

524::https://coinatory.com/cryptocurrency-articles/price-of-bitcoin-what-influence-btc-price-7304/::Coinatory::article::Price of Bitcoin: 6 main factors influence the BTC price::Discover the key factors that impact the price of Bitcoin. Learn about the various economic, political, and technological factors that can affect it.::Bitcoin (BTC) is a cryptocurrency that Satoshi Nakamoto, its unidentified creator, created in 2009. A blockchain keeps track of all transactions, displaying each unit’s transaction history and demonstrating ownership. Bitcoin is not backed by a government or issued by a central bank like conventional currencies are. Because Bitcoin is not a corporation, investing in it differs from investing in stocks or bonds. As a result, there are no corporate balance sheets, Form 10-Ks, fund results, or other conventional tools for selecting an investment to analyze. Learn about the factors that influence the price of bitcoin to justify better your decision to invest in it. The monetary policy instruments, inflation rates, and economic growth measurements that generally affect the value of a currency do not apply to Bitcoin because it is neither issued by a central bank nor backed by a government. Bitcoin acts as more of a commodity being used to store value, so the following factors influence its price: The supply of an asset is a key factor in setting its price. An asset in high demand is more likely to have high pricing than one in a large supply, which will have low prices. Since there will only be 21 million manufactured and only a certain number made year, the supply of Bitcoin is typically well publicized. Its protocol only permits the creation of new Bitcoin at a fixed rate, which is intended to decrease over time. Bitcoin’s future supply is, therefore, dwindling, which adds to demand. This is similar to a reduction in corn supply if harvests were to be reduced every four years until no more was harvested, and it was publicly advertised that this would happen—corn prices would skyrocket. Both regular people and big investors are starting to like bitcoin more because it’s getting a lot of attention in the news, from people who give investment advice, and from business owners who say bitcoin is valuable now and will be in the future. Countries like Venezuela, where money is losing its value fast, also like bitcoin a lot. People who need to move large amounts of money secretly or for illegal reasons also prefer it. This means that more people want bitcoin, but there won’t be as much available in the future, which has made its price go up. However, the price of bitcoin still goes up and down a lot. For example, in 2017, its price went up a lot, then it fell and stayed low for a while, and then in 2021, it quickly went up and down again. Similar to other commodities, production costs are a major factor in setting the price of bitcoin. Research suggests that the price of bitcoin in cryptocurrency marketplaces is closely correlated with its marginal cost of production. The production cost for Bitcoin is essentially the sum of the direct fixed expenses for the infrastructure and electricity needed to mine the cryptocurrency and an indirect cost associated with the algorithm’s degree of difficulty. A network of miners competes to decipher an encrypted number in order to mine bitcoins. The first miner to accomplish so receives a reward of newly created bitcoins as well as any transaction fees earned since the last block was located. It takes a lot of processing power to use brute force to solve the hash in order to unlock a block and receive a reward. The miner will have to spend a lot of money on numerous pricey mining equipment. Also, the bitcoin mining process uses a lot of electricity. According to estimates, the bitcoin mining network consumes more electricity than certain small nations. Despite the fact that Bitcoin is the most well-known cryptocurrency, there are hundreds of other tokens competing for capital. By 2022, Bitcoin will control the majority of cryptocurrency marketplaces. But with time, its power has diminished. Almost 80% of the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies in 2017 was made up of Bitcoin. The proportion fell to less than 50% by 2022. The fundamental cause of this was growing acceptance of alternative currency and their potential. For instance, due to a rise in decentralized finance, Ethereum has become a fierce rival to Bitcoin (DeFi). Ether (ETH), the cryptocurrency that serves as “gas” for transactions on its network, has attracted investment from investors who see its potential for redesigning the rails of contemporary financial infrastructure. The popularity of other cryptocurrencies has increased as they are continually being introduced. Other coins like Tether, Ethereum, BNB, USDCoin, and Solana are reducing the market share of Bitcoin. Competition has drawn investors to Bitcoin even as they have taken some of their dollars from the ecosystem. As a result, there is now more demand for and knowledge about cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has profited from the attention as a type of standard-bearer for the cryptocurrency ecosystem, and its prices have stayed high. Bitcoin came out after a financial crisis caused by weak rules in the trading of complex financial products. The world of cryptocurrencies is known for not having many rules and being open across countries because it’s not regulated yet. The fact that Bitcoin doesn’t have strict rules has its good and bad sides. It can be used anywhere in the world without the usual government restrictions. However, governments and other groups are still trying to figure out how to regulate cryptocurrencies. There’s a chance that new rules are coming, but it’s not clear how they will affect Bitcoin’s price. For example, decisions by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) can influence Bitcoin’s value. When the SEC approved the first U.S. bitcoin-related ETF, Bitcoin’s price shot up to $69,000 in October 2021. But a few months later, its price dropped to around $40,000. China’s ban on Bitcoin trading and mining in September 2021 also affected Bitcoin. It led to a decrease in its supply and demand. Prices fell from about $51,000 at the beginning of September to around $41,000 by the end of the month. However, prices went back up as the mining operations moved to more crypto-friendly countries and got back to business. News about Bitcoin can make its price go up or down, as it tries to keep investors and others interested. When anything changes with things that affect Bitcoin’s price, the news spreads fast. So, good news usually makes Bitcoin’s price go up, and bad news can make it go down. One big thing that changes cryptocurrency prices is how investors feel about it. This feeling is shaped by how much Bitcoin is available, how much people want it, how much it costs to make it, what other cryptocurrencies are doing, new rules, and what the news says about all of this.

Share this article Renowned art auction house Sotheby’s is making history by hosting the first public sale of works from a Bitcoin Ordinals collection. The inaugural series titled “BitcoinShrooms” was created by pseudonymous digital artist Shroomtoshi. Bitcoin Ordinals are the NFTs of the Bitcoin blockchain, taking advantage of its decentralized, censorship-resistant design and infrastructure. While similar to Ethereum NFTs in some ways, Bitcoin Ordinals benefit from Bitcoin’s decentralization and user sovereignty over its assets. We're thrilled to present our inaugural Bitcoin Ordinals sale, featuring @BitcoinShrooms 🍄 pic.twitter.com/UkX5jsfKLh — Sotheby's Metaverse (@Sothebysverse) December 6, 2023 Ordinals represent a proof of concept within the Bitcoin network and are often referred to as “digital artifacts” rather than NFTs which are, by design, non-fungible. The process involves inscribing satoshis, the smallest units of Bitcoin, with digital content or machine-readable language, reflecting Bitcoin’s immutable nature. This approach contrasts with traditional NFTs, especially regarding the lack of required royalty payments for sales. Consequently, Bitcoin Ordinals represent a significant deviation from conventional NFTs, often sparking debate within various Bitcoin communities. “Digital artifacts are permissionless. An NFT which cannot be sold without paying a royalty is not permissionless, and thus not a digital artifact,” the project’s documentation explains. The Bitcoin Ordinals project was begun by blockchain developer Casey Rodarmor, who hinged on the permissionless design of the Bitcoin blockchain as an initial concept to create digital artifacts. The online auction, open now through December 13, marks the public debut of these unique and probably rare pixel art pieces that offer a whimsical yet educational guided tour of Bitcoin’s cultural and technical revolution. The BitcoinShrooms collection’s standout pieces decode complex Bitcoin concepts like private key derivation and mining incentives through retro-themed pixel art mushrooms and clever cultural Easter eggs. Estimates for top works range between $20,000 to $30,000. “The BitcoinShrooms collection is a pixelated recap of the first 13 years of Bitcoin, a homage to the 8-bit style of art that expresses a slight nostalgia for the 90s, a way to soil 10s of thousands of SSDs spread across the world with my art (->next level cyber-vandalism,” said Shroomtoshi. The BitcoinShrooms sale enters a heated climate around the purpose and evolution of Bitcoin. Miners have prioritized maximizing transaction fee revenue lately, making them unlikely to restrict ordinal inscriptions despite complaints. On the other hand, Bitcoin developer Luke Dashjr sparked renewed debate by publicly decrying ordinals and other inscription projects as “spam attacks” on the Bitcoin network. Notably, Bitcoin has recently surpassed Ethereum in terms of average transaction fees. This change highlights the growing interest and activity in the Bitcoin network, especially in the context of how Ordinals and other blockchain innovations have emerged of late.

526::https://theconversation.com/how-blockchain-will-transform-our-cities-69561::The Conversation::article::How blockchain will transform our cities::If you think the internet has changed your life, brace yourself for the next digital innovation that’s set to transform our world.::Many trends on the horizon offer opportunities that could transform our cities. From self-driving vehicles and the sharing economy through to cloud computing and blockchain technologies, each of these trends is quite significant on its own. But the convergence of their disruptive forces is what will create real value and drive innovations. Take blockchain and the sharing economy as an example. Bringing these two forces together can potentially disrupt established companies like Uber and Airbnb. The success of these companies is largely due to their ability to make use of existing assets people owned, that had been paid for, but from which new value could be derived. Effectively, these companies set up digital platforms that harnessed “excess capacity” and relied on other people to deliver the services. The same applies to other so-called “sharing economy” companies that merely act as service aggregators and collect a cut off the top. In the process, they gather valuable data for further commercial gain. But can this business model be challenged and enhanced for the benefit of those who are delivering the service and creating the real value? Can technology be used to bypass the third party and allow direct peer-to-peer collaboration within a distributed governance structure? What could a “peer-owned” and “peer-run” marketplace look like? Blockchain technology could just be the answer. You can think of blockchain as the second generation of the internet – a transformation from an internet of information to an internet of value. Blockchain allows suppliers and consumers – even competitors – to share a decentralised digital ledger across a network of computers without the need for a central authority. The assets that can be described on the blockchain can be financial, legal, physical or electronic. No single party has the power to tamper with the records – sophisticated algorithms keep everyone honest by ensuring data integrity and authentication of transactions. But the impacts of blockchain go well beyond financial services and transactions. Its real value is in establishing trust-based interactions and accelerating the transfer of governance from centralised institutions to distributed networks of peer-to-peer collaboration. The impact can be profound: a centralised institution acting as intermediatory in a transaction of value is now at risk of being disrupted because the same service can be provided on the blockchain through peer-to-peer interaction. Blockchain gives service providers a means to collaborate and derive a greater share of the value for themselves. Smart agents on a blockchain could do just about everything provided by a service aggregator. The technology’s trust protocol allows autonomous associations to be formed and controlled by the same people who are creating the value. All revenues for services, minus overheads, would go to members, who also control the platform and make decisions. Trust is not established by third parties, but rather through an encrypted consensus enabled by smart coding. We already have examples of this technology in action. Arcade City, a global community of peer-to-peer services, is planning to offer a ride-sharing service on the blockchain. To catch a ride, the user buys digital currency (known as tokens), creates an offer and commits funds for the ride. A driver claims the offer, matches the funds to signal their commitment to provide the service, and picks up the passenger. The blockchain releases the funds as soon as the user acknowledges completing the ride. Arcade City has a city council, which will overlook the system for three years until it is fully decentralised and up and running. The same concept of using distributed public record technology can be applied to a wide range of urban applications. For example, an energy startup in Perth is looking to trial a peer-to-peer technology solution that would allow consumers to offer excess energy, available through their solar panels, on the blockchain. Clever code matches the suppliers with consumers without the need to go through the energy provider. The blockchain technology and ecosystem around it are evolving rapidly, and are probably raising more questions than answers. How do we establish a system of transparent governance to ensure the longevity of the blockchain? What about security, speed, cost and, more importantly, regulations? As with other disruptive technologies, there will be winners and losers. If the technology is successfully managed for scalable growth, it could very well disrupt established norms and transform our societies. Large layers of data generated by consumers today, which are controlled by hubs, can become public. In a world driven by blockchain, consumers can monetise their own data to derive greater value. By knowing when and how to take advantage of this technology, we have an opportunity to transform the digital platforms for tomorrow’s cities. The blockchain becomes the city’s operating system, invisible yet ubiquitous, improving citizens’ access to services, goods and economic opportunities. Today, the technology is yet to mature. It remains to be seen if the expectations can live up to reality. But, in many ways, this is quite reminiscent of the internet in the mid-1990s. Not many people would have predicted its significance back then. Had we understood the impacts of the internet 20 years ago, what could we have done differently to create more value? That is where we stand today with blockchain. The power of this transformation will become more compelling as the hype settles down and we begin to unleash the possibilities.::2016-12-13T19:04:57Z::Blockchain, Cities, Cities & Policy, Digital disruption, Internet, Sharing economy, disruptive technology::Hussein Dia::Home::https://images.theconversation.com/files/148571/original/image-20161205-19414-106q94z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C160%2C4274%2C2079&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
527::https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/04/30/its-modding-but-on-steroids-mark-long-on-the-future-of-web3-gaming/::CoinDesk::article::‘It's Modding, But on Steroids’: Mark Long on the Future of Web3 Gaming::Shrapnel, a blockchain-infused first-person shooter game, is expected to be released in 2025. Its creator gives a preview to Jeff Wilser ahead of his appearance at Consensus 2024.::Web3 games have a shaky track record. It’s easy to see the appeal: There are literally billions of people playing games, and most of them do it for free. They spend countless hours — and often their own cash — to create content that grows the ecosystem, and they get nothing while the gaming companies get everything. Web3 games, in theory, give power (and equity) to the players. Or, that was the pitch in the last bull cycle, when Web3 games like Axie Infinity seemed to create new economies and even lift players from poverty. Then prices tumbled, games crumbled. Can Web3 games make a comeback? Mark Long is a speaker at Consensus 2024, in Austin, Texas, May 29-31. Now at least one thing is different: Top-tier gaming talent has entered the Web3 space, focused on creating games that are actually a blast to play, not just a means to grind out crypto. “It’s very important that it’s a great game, period, whether for Web2 or Web3,” says Mark Long, CEO of Shrapnel, the blockchain-infused and “moddable” first-person shooter game, which is expected to be released in 2025. (Modding refers to the ability of gamers to modify aspects of the game experience.) Long knows about building great games. He’s the former head of Xcloud, a game-streaming service, at Microsoft, the former head of publishing at HBO Interactive, and he’s produced over 32 games in his 26-year career. And now he’s bringing that savvy to Web3. Long opens up about the extra challenges in creating a Web3 game (the wrong tweak to a database can cost players millions), what gamers can expect from Shrapnel (“modding on steroids”), and why he views Consensus as the most “scholarly” crypto conference. Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity. What’s the vision of Shrapnel? What are you trying to pull off? Mark Long: So, I love triple-A shooters. I just love all shooters; I play all of them all the time. But what I love more is actually modding shooters. And I mean, going all the way back to Doom 2 and Quake and Half-Life. You're speaking my language. I still remember the keyboard shortcut to pull up the shotgun in Doom. Yes! So even though I was making games in the studio during the day, at night I would come home and mod those type of games. And if I got 11 people to play my map, I'd be thrilled. Right? Which is ridiculous because I'm making games for millions of players. But this is something very personal. I get a personal joy from modding a game that I really like. So, fast forward to the Roblox, Minecraft, Fortnite era. Kids start off making their own content in Minecraft, and they age into Roblox, and so they become more proficient. And with Fortnite, 50% of the engagement is made by other players, which is stunning. But when you turn 18 to 35 years old, there's nothing for you to age into. And I don't think young players are going to stop wanting to make their own games. And our theory is if you gave them the same professional level of tools that we have, they'd actually make some pretty cool shit. So, that's what Shrapnel is. It's an extraction first-person shooter based on Web3. And it’s a free, frictionless database technology that allows us to seamlessly attribute all these contributions that players can make to a game, and then reward them for it. How so? You’ll be rewarded for your contribution. And in our world, that can be a lot of things. You can modify our maps — just use all our static meshes and modify them. You can do character skins. You can do character customization. Make emblems, customize weapons. And then, of course, you just mint those. And then I could sell, trade, rent, stake all those items. That's what I'm really excited about. It's modding, but on steroids. Let’s talk about Web3 gaming more broadly. Taking Shrapnel out of the equation, why do you think there haven’t yet been any great Web3 games? So, all these games were put into production in the last bull cycle, right? And they’re just now coming to the public in early access or open beta. But I'd argue there are a handful of really good games out there that I'm excited to play. There’s MetalCore, the mech shooter. There's Wildcard, the card-battler game by the husband and wife team that did Words with Friends. I like Dead Drop. I like Off the Grid, which has art direction by Neill Blomkamp. I fucking love Neill Blomkamp. So the short version is there are a handful of games that actually are going to be really good and break through, and then of course there’s Shrapnel. Fair enough! There are some good games. But those seem to be the outliers. I think part of your lament for the earlier Web3 games is because of two reasons: A lot of the teams are not game development teams, they're crypto development teams. Right? And two, it’s production values. They haven’t had the money to put into the game to make it really great. What’s extra challenging about building a Web3 game, compared to a traditional video game? What are the additional wrinkles caused by decentralization? Great question. I want to start by saying that it’s very important that it’s a great game, period, whether for Web2 or Web3. It’s easy to lose track of that. But to answer your question, one simple thing comes to mind. Think about working on a database in a game. Think about, for example, all the items I can collect for my character — my gear, my helmet, my weapon, all that stuff. You have a pretty complex database and it has to provide for all this attribution. If I make a mistake in normal development, you just reset the database and then start over again. But here with web3, that has real-world value. Right? So if we fuck up and I delete your $1,000 worth of stuff, I can't claim that I'm World of Warcraft and you never really owned it anyway. That’s a huge problem. So we have to be especially meticulous as we integrate any Web3 component. Then there’s the problem of potential exploits — things that we miss could create a disaster for the economy. It takes longer to integrate the Web3 component. The code has to be audited at a level that game code never normally needs to be audited. That was all brand new to us. It slows down our roadmap. But as we get better at it and there’s more tooling APIs and SDKs available, it will just get better and better. For many who are only casually following the Web3 gaming space, they’ve heard of the boom-and-bust cycle of “Play to Earn.” There are concerns that this model is not sustainable — it only works when the token price is rising, but then, if the price falls, the economy collapses. What’s the solve for this? What’s the trick for making Web3 games viable for the long-term, and not relying upon price appreciation? So I would probably guess that for the economies that you’re thinking about that collapsed, they’re kind of pyramid economies where you have to have a large number inflowing at the bottom, and they grind and level-up assets or characters that then get sold to the person above them who’s also grinding. You need lots coming in at the bottom to do that. And then when the community collapses or the token price collapses, nobody's playing because it's a fun game — they’re there to make money off it. So they abandon it. Ah, so the trick is the game quality itself… What we think will happen in game economies like Shrapnel is the more players you have, and the more engagement you have, the more they’re using the token in-game. That’s driving the need for the token and it kind of has a burn effect. It’s consuming the supply, and that means there's more buy pressure than sell pressure. If I hear you right, it sounds like you’re saying there needs to be actual legit utility in these tokens. It’s not sham utility. People are using it. They're using it because they want to play the game and have fun. So the game needs to be good, period. Am I getting that right? Yeah. Let's just use a rough order of magnitude example. The average paying player in Web3 might be $100 a month versus $10 a month on Web2. So every one of those new Web3 players adds $100 of consumption. Remember, the economy is in the token, so they are spending $100 of the token. Okay, last couple of questions are about Consensus itself. What’s your favorite Consensus memory? Well, you know, last year we demoed the game for the first time at Consensus. We were right at one of the main entrances, and by the end of the first day, they had just moved the bar to our space because so many people wanted to play the game, and were excited to get their hands on it. What are you most looking forward to at Consensus this year? It’s a really well-curated conference. I would call it a scholarly conference, where the panels are well-vetted. Love it, and thank you. On a less scholarly front, what’s the best Consensus side-party? It'll be ours. Good answer. See you there! Edited by Benjamin Schiller.

Super Sushi Samurai (SSS), a newly launched altcoin, has suffered a significant security breach. As of the latest update, SSS’s market value has dropped to $0.000000000002239, marking a devastating 99% decrease. Likewise, its 24-hour trading volume spiraled down to $9,570.9. The breach was first detected and announced by Certik, a leading security firm specializing in blockchain technology. According to Certik, the Super Sushi Samurai token experienced a critical incident on the Blast platform. It led to a substantial loss of approximately $4.6 million. Despite the alarming nature of the breach, Certik clarified that the incident involved a white hat rescue operation. The firm suggested that the actions taken were aimed at preventing further damage rather than exploiting the system for malicious gain. The Super Sushi Samurai team quickly responded to the crisis by halting all token transfers and launching a thorough investigation into the exploit, which was identified as related to the minting process. “Pausing token transfers and investigating. We have been exploited, it’s mint related. We are still looking into the code,” the team disclosed.

529::https://blockworks.co/news/near-foundation-chain-signatures::Blockworks::article::NEAR launches tool for signing transactions on Bitcoin, Ethereum and more::NEAR Foundation has launched “Chain Signatures,” enabling users to sign transactions on supported blockchains from a single NEAR account.::At launch, Chain Signatures will be compatible with Bitcoin, Ethereum and Cosmos network chains, as well as DogeCoin and XRP Ledger NEAR Foundation and Adobe Stock modified by Blockworks Swiss non-profit organization NEAR Foundation has launched “Chain Signatures,” enabling users to sign transactions on supported blockchains from a single NEAR account. Chain Signatures enables accounts and smart contracts on NEAR to sign transactions for different chains. At launch, this will include Bitcoin, Ethereum and Cosmos network chains, as well as DogeCoin and XRP Ledger. It will soon support Solana, TON Network and Polkadot, according to the team. By enabling Chain signatures, DeFi protocols can utilize assets from other chains without requiring a cross-chain bridge. This is possible because Chain Signatures are designed to be account-based rather than bridge-based. Read more: NEAR Foundation applies for .near top-level domain According to Kendall Cole, director of research and development company Proximity Labs — which supports projects on NEAR and Aurora — Chain Signatures can potentially unlock new use cases for DeFi protocols. “Users can use XRP as collateral to borrow USDC, or trade DOGE for SOL. This is particularly innovative for non-smart-contract chains like Bitcoin, DogeCoin and Ripple because none of the major bridges support these chains today,” Cole said. NEAR protocol documents show that Chain Signatures link NEAR account addresses to other blockchains using an Additive Key Derivation. This mechanism enables the single master key to be derived into multiple subkeys. When a user wants to transact between different blockchains, a deployed multichain smart contract will make a signature request for the transaction on the target blockchain network, and a Multi-Party Computation (MPC) service will sign the transaction. Read more: MPC wallets have a trade-off. Is it worth it? Once the signature is obtained, the smart contract will return it to the user, allowing the user to send the signed transaction to execute it on the target blockchain. “Smart contracts on NEAR will be able to custody assets on any chain (since they can sign transactions on any chain via chain signatures), and maintain user balances similar to how single chain lending protocols or DEXs do now,” Cole explained. The Chain Signatures MPC network will be launched in partnership with EigenLayer, which will secure the network using its restaked ETH. At launch, there will be ten node providers, including a handful of Actively Validated Services (AVS) infrastructure providers. “Post-launch, EigenLayer will be used to provide economic security to the network and transition the MPC network to a permissionless version. To participate in the MPC network, prospective node operators will need to re-stake their ETH and will be penalized if they maliciously authorize any transactions that did not originate from a NEAR account,” Cole explained.

530::https://coinatory.com/cryptocurrency-articles/the-secret-of-arbitrage-trading-7095/::Coinatory::article::Increase your profits with arbitrage trading - check out these examples!::Are you ready to take your cryptocurrency trading to the next level? Don't miss this essential guide to arbitrage trading.::Arbitrage trading is the simultaneous purchase and sale of a single asset or a group of related assets in various markets with the goal of making a profit from minute variations in the asset’s quoted price. It takes advantage of brief fluctuations in the cost of identical or comparable financial products on various markets or in various forms. Arbitrage exists as a result of market inefficiencies, and it both exploits those inefficiencies and resolves them. Any time a stock, commodity, or piece of currency can be bought at one price on one market and simultaneously sold at a higher price on another, arbitrage can be used. The circumstance offers the trader the chance to profit without taking any risks. Arbitrage offers a way to make sure that prices don’t diverge significantly from fair value over an extended period of time. With advancements in technology, it has become extremely difficult to profit from pricing errors in the market. A lot of traders have automated trading programs configured to track changes in similar financial instruments. Any ineffective pricing structures are typically addressed quickly, often within a few seconds, and the opportunity is lost. As a simple illustration of arbitrage, think of the following: on cryptocurrency exchange A, token X is currently trading at $20; on cryptocurrency exchange B, it is currently trading at $20.05. A trader can buy token X on cryptocurrency exchange A and immediately sell the same token X on cryptocurrency exchange B to make a profit of 5 cents per coin. The trader can continue to use this arbitrage until cryptocurrency exchange A runs out of this token or until exchange A or exchange B specialists adjust their prices to eliminate the opportunity. A trickier example can be found in currencies markets using triangular arbitrage. In this case, the trader converts one currency to another, converts that second currency to a third bank, and finally converts the third currency back to the original currency. Assume you are given the following exchange rates for your $1 million: USD/EUR = 1.1586, EUR/GBP = 1.4600, and USD/GBP = 1.6939. There is a chance to make money by arbitraging these exchange rates: From these transactions, you would receive an arbitrage profit of $1,384 Trading called “arbitrage” takes advantage of the minute price differences between identical or similar assets in two or more markets. The arbitrage trader buys the asset in one market and sells it in the other market at the same time to pocket the difference between the two prices. The following is a list of some of the most common questions we get asked about our services. Arbitrage traders, or arbitrageurs, typically work for major financial institutions. It typically entails trading a sizeable sum of money, and the split-second opportunities it presents can only be recognized and taken advantage of with extremely sophisticated software. The practice of buying and selling shares of stocks, commodities, cryptocurrencies, or currencies on various markets in order to take advantage of the inevitable fluctuations in their prices from minute to minute is known as arbitrage. However, the term “arbitrage” is also sometimes used to describe other trading activities. One tactic that is well-liked among hedge fund investors is merger arbitrage, which entails purchasing shares of companies prior to a merger that has been announced or is anticipated. Arbitrage traders improve the efficiency of financial markets by working to increase their profits. As they buy and sell, the price difference between identical or similar assets narrows. Assets with a lower price are sold, while assets with a higher price are not sold. In this way, arbitrage eliminates market pricing inefficiencies and increases market liquidity.

531::https://cryptobriefing.com/walmart-launches-pudgy-penguins-nft-linked-toys/::Crypto Briefing::article::Walmart Launches Pudgy Penguins NFT-Linked Toys::Pudgy Penguins is the first NFT brand to have a presence in a major retail chain.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Pudgy Penguins, one of the most popular NFT collections, announced today that its new line of Pudgy Toys will now be sold in 2,000 Walmart stores across the US. Each toy comes with a unique code that unlocks access to Pudgy World, a multiplayer game built on zkSync Era’s layer-2 blockchain where players can customize their penguin avatar. The game aims to blend real-world and digital play. The partnership represents a major retail milestone for Pudgy Penguins, a company born out of the recent boom in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and blockchain technology. Since launching in 2021, the company has seen over $400 million in sales of its digital collectibles. “Pudgy Penguins is at the forefront of transforming the toy industry, merging unique digital experiences with blockchain technology,” said Pudgy Penguins CEO Luca Netz in a statement. The company says its toys leverage both social media and blockchain technology to create an innovative brand experience. The NFT holders who own the digital art that the toy designs are based on will receive royalties from toy sales. For Walmart, carrying the line helps the retail giant tap into new digital toy trends. “Pudgy Penguins is bridging the gap between our physical and digital worlds of play for kids in a really engaging way,” said Brittany Smith, Walmart’s vice president of toys.

532::https://theconversation.com/is-blockchain-all-hype-a-financier-and-supply-chain-expert-discuss-106584::The Conversation::article::Is blockchain all hype? A financier and supply chain expert discuss::Academics from different disciplines come Head to Head in this series to tackle topical debates.::This is an article from Head to Head, a series in which academics from different disciplines chew over current debates. Let us know what else you’d like covered – all questions are welcome. Details of how to contact us are at the end of the article. Arturo Bris: Have you ever watched footage from the early 1980s of people trying to explain the internet? They’re sceptical and confused and have no idea how to say “@”, which is comical given what we now take for granted. But that’s where we are with blockchain now. People don’t believe in it because they don’t understand it. Blockchain is a technology with two ingredients: the first is a distributed ledger, meaning a database with identical copies held by everyone in a network. There is no intermediary, no central data depository. The second is a consensus algorithm (and this is the true innovation in the technology): the ability to digitally agree on any change in the data. It is the set of decision rules by which any new entry in the database is accepted and then shared by everyone. The consensus algorithm will be different for every blockchain – some work on a simple majority rule, some (such as Bitcoin) have a subset of members paid to fulfil that role, and others have much more complicated arrangements. The structure of the database is also particular, because it is structure as a sequence of entries (a ledger), not a deposit. If you don’t understand blockchain, get educated, because it’s an amazing new technology that’s going to revolutionise the world. It’s going to monetise and unlock value that today is hidden. The social impact is going to be massive. It’s going to permit new avenues for human interaction that didn’t exist before. Carlos Cordon: I’m not sure about that, Arturo. I, for instance, understand what blockchain is, but I don’t believe that it’s going to have the impact you describe. Blockchain requires having a lot of copies of the same data. This means that you are required to multiply the data storage by, let’s say, 100 times. The same data is stored in 100 places. That might work for something as standard and simple as money: Bitcoin works, for example, because there is just one Bitcoin, not thousands of different products. But if you think about supply chains, for example, you’re talking about thousands of products. For each product, a lot of information is required, like weight, format, expiry date, composition, etc. This means that blockchain is extremely impractical for many of the applications that its evangelists are proposing. Amazon isn’t using blockchain. Google isn’t. In fact, none of the top digital giants are, although Amazon has said it’s happy to provide cloud storage for it. The Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Krugman has said that Bitcoin will “set the monetary system back 300 years”. AB: Krugman also said in 2011 that the Euro would soon disappear, and look where we are today. And, with respect to Google and Amazon, that’s exactly what disruptive technologies are: they are not usually adopted by the established players, because they disrupt their own – established – business models. And by the way, more and more companies are using blockchain for applications beyond cryptocurrencies. These include music streaming, social networking, commodities trading, property registries – the list goes on. Blockchain is a technology that guarantees full security (it cannot be hacked) because data are already shared by the members of the network, so there is nothing to hack. We are already seeing the transformation moving extremely fast, and that’s why you need to embrace it. CC: The way blockchain works makes it secure and trustworthy, that much is true. But if we introduce blockchain into supply chains, for example, we’re firstly trying to solve a problem that isn’t there – and, secondly, we’re possibly creating further problems for ourselves. This is because trust in supply chains generally isn’t an issue. Let’s imagine I’m Unilever or Procter & Gamble. Am I going to try to cheat Walmart or Carrefour? No. We have a certain level of trust. We may disagree, but we don’t cheat. But with blockchain comes complete transparency. And we don’t want that. Not because we don’t trust the other partner, but because we use information to negotiate. Besides, in supply chains we’ve been working on sharing information and data for years. We don’t need new data technologies. It’s already complicated enough. AB: I have no problem with that. If trust does not need to be formalised, there is no need for blockchain. I don’t think we will use blockchain to manufacture cookware or to design new means of transportation either. But what makes blockchain revolutionary is the transformation of physical assets into digital ones. This is known as tokenization. Cryptocurrencies, for example, are the tokenization of money, but that is only one example. You can tokenize stocks and financial assets, property, music, services – the list goes on. By replicating assets with a digital token, we can facilitate transactions without physical delivery. CC: Then there’s the challenge of a potential mismatch between the virtual value chain and the physical value chain. You can tokenize assets, but what happens if someone changes the physical product? Blockchain couldn’t have prevented the UK horsemeat scandal, for example, where horsemeat was found in products that supposedly contained only beef. Meanwhile, the need for storage is going to multiply by an order of magnitude as copies of all these ledgers are held by each individual in a blockchain. And the only people who are going to benefit from that are companies like Amazon, selling cloud storage. AB: This is a fallacy. In fact, the structure of a blockchain allows us to store the whole database by storing just a small part of it. I know this is difficult to understand. In fact what happens is that, through encryption, we will be able to drastically reduce the size of the entries. Second, because of the sequential nature of the database, and since all entries are linked both to the previous and the next one, we will need to store just the last block(s) of the database. Overall, I think that we need to think beyond the storage of data and contracts as the main uses of blockchain. Tokenization will transform our transactions. Besides, the lack of need for intermediaries will also transform organisations. We can develop a new type of organisation that is democratic, not in the sense that it doesn’t need a CEO but in the sense of a decentralised autonomous organisation that is super efficient. This is going to be the future. By monetising assets that we currently do not monetise – such as our social capital, our fitness data, our attention to advertisers – we will add value. And that is only possible through a technology so new and complex that we’re still struggling to explain to each other how it works. CC: OK. But so far, I have seen no evidence of blockchain being used for truly revolutionary purposes. Walmart is using it to track vegetables. I saw a headline recently: “IBM joins efforts to create the blockchain equivalent of Yellow Pages” – Yellow Pages died 20 years ago, why are they trying to resuscitate that concept? Blockchain is certainly one of the top strategic tech trends at the moment but from looking at what companies are actually doing with it, I don’t think it’s going to change the world.

But will the hype match reality? A metaverse NEOM Legislation::The Middle East has been making strides in Web3. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) established digital assets regulators such as the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) in Dubai and the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) in Abu Dhabi. Last year, ADGM-based Hub71 launched a $2 billion initiative to support Web3 startups in the region. Thanks to its favorable stance towards cryptocurrency, innovation, and tax incentives, the UAE has become a hotspot for crypto and blockchain projects and funds. And now Saudi Arabia, its rival, is ambitious to prove it can become its own Web3 hub. U.K.-based Outlier Ventures recently announced it is launching its own Web3 accelerator program in partnership with Saudi’s National Technology Development Program (NPDP). "The level of dedication, education, and international experience of the highly skilled workforce, as well as the people coming to the Kingdom, is very interesting to see," said Outlier Ventures CEO Stephan Apel. “While the Web3 ecosystem in the Kingdom is still developing, we observe an extraordinarily fast rate of development and a huge potential,” Apel told CoinDesk. Saudi Arabia’s $95 billion Public Investment Fund (PIF) has reportedly held partnership talks with Andreessen Horowitz (A16z), one the leading VC backers of Web3 startups. Animoca Brands, a leading Asian Web3 gaming VC, has partnered with King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST) in the capital, Riyadh to advance the gaming ecosystem in the country. Speaking at The Outer Edge Summit, held at The Garage, a 28,000 meter squared startup district in KACST, Robby Yung, CEO of Amonica Brands lauded opportunities in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East. “We are coming here a little bit late, we recognized the opportunity here a decade ago but didn’t have the resources to tackle a new market at that time,” he said. “Here’s a really big piece of the world map… Since 2020, the UAE has become a gathering place for Web3 as a community because of the regulatory framework. Here, you have a huge country and over 60% of them are under the age of 30. Those are gamers, those are our people. So, we want to be on the ground, we want to understand how we can communicate with them. We felt it was important to start here as a point of contact,” Yung told CoinDesk during Animoca’s Outer Edge Summit in Riyadh. Meanwhile Golden Gate Ventures, a Singapore-based VC firm, has expanded its offices to the Gulf region and sees Saudi Arabia as the next frontier. “Overall, investment appetite in Saudi Arabia is very healthy, although we haven't seen Web3 as prominent as in other parts of the region. With the increased investment in artificial intelligence, we'll see more investments in Web3 follow swiftly,” Micheal Lints, a partner at Golden Gate, said. Saudi Arabia has advantages and disadvantages when it comes to attracting Web3 investment. It ranks in 62nd place in the World Bank’s “Ease of Doing Business” country index, outperforming for criteria like “setting up a business” (38th place overall) and “getting electricity” (18th). It does less well for “getting credit” (80th place) and “trading across borders” (86th). Its policies on women in the workplace, and alcohol, may make it unattractive to startups used to operating in less socially-restrictive environments. XVRS, the metaverse platform for NEOM, the $1.5 trillion desert city that was announced in 2017, is one of Saudi Arabia’s largest Web3-related projects to date. More than $1 billion has been invested in the creation of an immersive digital twin of NEOM, it has been reported. The space will offer immersive entertainment, a social platform, and a built-in digital marketplace for crypto and NFTs, the project backers say. During the Saudi Ministry of Investment Association’s inaugural Leap Summit, in February, the Hashgraph Association announced a five-year partnership to support local tech startups, including DeepTech, a $250 million venture studio. Leap Summit, Saudi Arabia's annual tech conference, attracted more than 220,000 attendees this year – nearly double that of Las Vegas’ Consumer Electronic Show (CES). While the Kingdom’s legal provisions for cryptocurrency are unclear, a report from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis reveals growing appetite for crypto among the Saudi population of 36 million. Saudi crypto investors amassed more than $350 million in crypto gains in 2023, overtaking the UAE, which recorded approximately $204 million in during the same period, the analysis shows. Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, is eyeing the country as a source of growth, according to Bandar Al Tunisi, Development Lead for Binance in Saudi Arabia. Binance is talking with regulators, including the SAMA central bank and the capital markets regulatory authority, along with the Ministry of Communications and Information, he said. Al Tunisi hopes for “high-level” regulation for digital currencies in the country as soon as this year. “I think it's one of the most important places in the world in terms of opportunity, in terms of growth, in terms of the willingness of the leadership, in terms of nimbleness of the leadership and the capability of the local population,” he said. “We are hopeful [the regulatory framework] will happen this year. Obviously that's not something that we have control over, but we're on the ground. We're ready.” Saudi Arabia's proactive approach to fostering innovation, coupled with strategic partnerships and its Vision 2030 initiative, positions the Kingdom as a significant contender in the global Web3 landscape. But time will tell if the current expectation, driven by government impetus, results in a sustainable Web3 industry. Correction (4/30/24/ 14:54 UTC): Bandar Al Tunisi is Binance's development lead.

534::https://beincrypto.com/altcoin-trader-strategy-meme-coin-mania/::BeInCrypto::article::Altcoin Trader Reveals Strategy For the Meme Coin Mania::An altcoin trader achieves important gains with meme coins by 'sniping' new launches. Learn his strategy and tools used for success.::We use cookies to improve your experience.  Altcoin trader Rekt Fencer has caused a stir with his candid revelation on achieving a staggering 1,000X gains through meme coins. Fencer’s strategy, centered on the concept of ‘sniping’ new token launches, is allegedly profitable even for those with investors modest capital. Fencer explained one of the easiest methods to achieve significant returns with meme coins. This approach, while controversial, has shown to be effective for him in a market where timing and information are everything. The key to Fencer’s method lies in meticulous pre-analysis and constant monitoring of the market for new listings. By utilizing resources like DEX Screener, traders can identify trending narratives and potential catalysts that could drive the price of newly listed meme coins. “The longer the narrative in the Top Gainers, the stronger it becomes,” Fencer noted Read more: 7 Hot Meme Coins and Altcoins that are Trending in 2024 Moreover, Fencer shed light on the critical role of sniper bots in executing this strategy. These bots are designed to buy tokens as quickly as possible at launch. Therefore, they can significantly increase the chances of securing a token before its value skyrockets. Among the recommended tools are BONKbot for Solana on-chain trading, BananaGun for Ethereum and Solana, and Unibot, a popular choice for EVM and soon Solana. “To buy tokens as fast as possible, you need to use sniper bots. There isn’t a universal bot that works perfectly for every chain. Each bot has its own customization instructions. Mastering this skill isn’t easy, but the rewards that follow will more than compensate for your efforts,” Fencer added. Read more: 13 Best AI Crypto Trading Bots To Maximize Your Profits However, Fencer’s method is not without its risks. The volatile nature of meme coins and the potential for crypto scams underscore the importance of diligence and risk management. Investors are advised to verify the security of tokens through platforms like Rug Check and Coin Scan. Traders must also be prepared for the possibility that not every investment will yield the anticipated returns. Despite the inherent risks, Fencer’s strategy offers a tantalizing glimpse into the potential rewards of cryptocurrency trading. By combining thorough research, strategic use of technology, and an understanding of market dynamics, traders can position themselves to capture significant gains.

535::https://blockworks.co/news/franklin-templeton-new-crypto-etf-offering::Blockworks::article::Franklin Templeton debuts new crypto SMA amid bitcoin ETF hype ::Franklin Templeton's new SMA is set to hold BTC and ETH and be available for wealth managers on Eaglebrook Advisors’ platform.::New separately managed account is set to hold BTC and ETH and be available for wealth managers on Eaglebrook Advisors’ platform BalkansCat/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks After debuting a bitcoin ETF and eyeing the launch of an ether-focused counterpart, Franklin Templeton also continues to build out another segment of crypto products. The fund giant, with more than $1 trillion in assets under management, has launched the Franklin Templeton Digital Asset Dynamic BTC/ETH separately managed account (SMA), the company said Tuesday. SMAs offer a nuanced approach to investing, allowing investors greater customization in terms of asset diversification and tax optimization strategies. In the crypto realm, SMAs offer investors exposure to a range of exposures that go beyond bitcoin — currently the only crypto asset that US ETFs can hold directly. Read more: ETF adoption set to keep driving bitcoin price: 10T’s Dan Tapiero The actively managed product seeks to outperform a market cap-weighted portfolio of bitcoin and ether. It is to be available for registered investment advisers (RIAs) and other US wealth managers on Eaglebrook Advisors’ SMA platform. Anchorage Digital is set to custody the assets. Franklin Templeton’s latest SMA comes after the firm introduced two such investment vehicles in 2022. Its Digital Assets Core SMA invests in 10 to 15 of the largest digital assets. The Franklin Templeton Digital Assets Core Capped SMA deploys a similar strategy, but caps its allocations to BTC and ETH at 25% of the portfolio each. Franklin Templeton launched its Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) alongside a slate of competitors on Jan. 11. The fund currently ranks ninth of the 10 US spot bitcoin funds — in terms of assets under management — with $312 million as of market close Monday. The spot bitcoin ETFs have so far notched total net inflows of roughly $11.3 billion. Industry watchers expect more wealth managers to make such funds available to clients in the coming months, catalyzing further growth in the segment. Aside from diversified exposure, SMAs allow for investors to engage in tax-loss harvesting — purposefully incurring capital losses to offset capital gains taxes — and allow clients to own the underlying assets directly in their name at a qualified custodian, executives have said. Read more: Eaglebrook CEO: Bitcoin ETF would send crypto SMAs ‘into hyperdrive’ “[Crypto ETFs] allow more people to dip their toes in…in an easier way, which will in turn drive demand for our solutions from advisers because of the extra value prop via strategies and assets they can’t access in the ETF wrapper,” Eaglebrook CEO Christopher King told Blockworks last year. While the Securities and Exchange Commission approved ether futures ETFs, investors in the US cannot access exposure to ether via an ETH that holds the asset directly, for example. Read more: Ether ETFs coming in May? Here’s why many are bearish Franklin Templeton is one of several firms — along with BlackRock, Grayscale Investments, Ark Invest and others — with spot ether ETF proposals in front of the SEC. Potential future US ETFs holding crypto assets other than BTC and ETH are “a little bit out of sight,” Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan told Blockworks on a podcast in January. It would be “a big leap” to get to a solana ETF, for example, Hougan added — noting there is not yet a regulated futures market for SOL.

536::https://coinatory.com/cryptocurrency-articles/are-there-any-ways-to-invest-in-crypto-without-buying-it-7107/::Coinatory::article::Are there any ways to invest in crypto without buying it?::If you are not interested in creating an account on an exchange to buy crypto, you still have several alternatives for investing in cryptocurrency.::Are there any hidden techniques to delve into the realm of cryptocurrencies beyond buying and investing in popular cryptos like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and alternative coins? We’ve scrutinized what you must comprehend to invest in cryptocurrencies without acquiring them directly. If you’re not interested in creating an account on a cryptocurrency exchange to buy coins, you still have some alternatives available. One option is to invest indirectly in cryptocurrencies, which allows you to gain exposure to them without purchasing any. It can be achieved through traditional methods such as stocks, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). In the same vein, it’s important to consider the advantages and disadvantages of indirect investments in cryptocurrencies, such as security, expenses, and the potential for losses. It’s worth noting that when deciding whether to invest indirectly in cryptocurrencies, you should bear in mind that the intermediary involved will likely earn some form of compensation. One option for indirectly buying cryptocurrencies is through investment funds, and one of the notable pioneers in this area is Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). While it operates like an ETF, it is legally structured as a distinct type of organization. Nevertheless, purchasing a Bitcoin fund is equivalent to investing in GBTC via your brokerage account, with the investment cost varying in line with the market price of bitcoin. The 2% expense ratio is the main drawback of Grayscale. In essence, they charge you a 2% fee for buying Bitcoin and storing it in a wallet registered under your name. However, you can avoid paying this fee repeatedly by doing it yourself. It’s easily. There are several funds available, such as the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund, Global X Blockchain & Bitcoin Strategy ETF, Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF, VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF, and ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) (BITW), among others. It’s important to note that each fund has varying fees and underlying investments, so it’s essential to review the prospectus carefully and comprehend what you’re getting into before making a decision. You can opt for either company that operates in the blockchain industry or those that hold or invest in cryptocurrency when selecting a stock that provides exposure to cryptocurrencies. Companies in the cryptocurrency sector provide services like as software development and mining. Companies to consider include Bitfarms, Canaan, HIVE Blockchain Technologies, and Riot Blockchain (RIOT) (BITF). One of the biggest and most well-known cryptocurrency exchanges and stocks is Coinbase (COIN). In general, the majority of cryptocurrency stocks tend to decline when Bitcoin prices fall. It’s important to bear this risk in mind when making a purchase. If you have any concerns or queries regarding your investment decisions or objectives, seeking advice from a trustworthy financial expert may be worthwhile. A cryptocurrency is a type of digital or virtual currency that can be securely bought, sold, or exchanged using cryptographic techniques. Unlike fiat currencies, it is not governed or regulated by a central authority, such as a bank or government. Bitcoin is the world’s first successful decentralized cryptocurrency, created by anonymous individual/individuals Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 as a way to conduct payments. It is digital money that allows for secure peer-to-peer transactions on the internet. The person or persons who created the original Bitcoin program and launched cryptocurrency into the world in 2008 go by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Up until around 2010, Nakamoto worked on bitcoin and the blockchain, but he hasn’t been seen or heard from since.

537::https://cryptobriefing.com/kraken-tether-review-eu/::Crypto Briefing::article::Kraken may delist USDT in EU to comply with MiCA::The exchange has no current plans to delist Tether, said a Kraken spokesperson.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Major crypto exchange Kraken is considering delisting Tether (USDT) from its European Union (EU) platform to comply with the upcoming Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations, according to a recent report from Bloomberg. The EU is setting MiCA regulations for crypto trading, specifically targeting stablecoins like Tether’s USDT. These rules will be enforced starting in July and will likely restrict how these stablecoins are offered in the EU. In a Thursday interview, Marcus Hughes, Kraken’s global head of regulatory strategy, said they are waiting for clearer guidance on the rules before making a final decision. “We’re absolutely planning for all eventualities, including situations where it’s just not tenable to list specific tokens such as USDT. It’s something that we’re actively reviewing, and as the position becomes clearer, we can take firm decisions on that,” Hughes stated. In response to Kraken’s considerations, Tether emphasized the importance of focusing on Euro liquidity for European customers while maintaining USDT as a transaction gateway. Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s CEO, has also voiced concerns about certain MiCA requirements and indicated that Tether will continue engaging with regulators. However, the company does not intend to be regulated under MiCA in the medium term. The MiCA regulations aim to establish a licensing system for stablecoin issuers and impose stricter corporate governance and reserve management requirements. Kraken anticipates that under MiCA, many stablecoins currently available in the EU will likely be delisted. “It’s an evolving picture. What we’re clear on is that the scope of the type and number of stablecoins that are offered today in Europe are unlikely to be able to be offered going forward,” Hughes added. “At some point in the future, there’ll be a cut off at which that won’t be possible. A lot of that will depend on which assets are being properly registered within the European Union under the e-money regime.” Following the publication of this article, Kraken contacted CryptoBriefing to provide the following statement from a spokesperson: “There are no current plans to delist Tether or alter our USDT trading pairs. As a leading crypto exchange, we are constantly evaluating our global strategy and operations to ensure that we remain compliant both now and in the future. We are committed to following the rules as we continue our mission of accelerating the adoption of this asset class.” As the European Banking Authority finalizes the technical standards for MiCA, exchanges like Kraken are preparing for a future in which the current range of stablecoins may not be sustainable in Europe. OKX, another major crypto exchange, already limited USDT functionality in the EU earlier this year.

538::https://theconversation.com/a-rubbish-idea-how-blockchains-could-tackle-the-worlds-waste-problem-94457::The Conversation::article::A rubbish idea: how blockchains could tackle the world’s waste problem::The technology underlying Bitcoin is starting to spread its wings.::Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin may fill news headlines, but attention has been shifting to the technology that underpins them: blockchains. Blockchains are virtual ledgers on which data can be permanently stored. They are a public record, so they are very transparent and accountable. The Big Four accounting firms, IBM and JP Morgan have been driving uptake by investigating applications. Blockchains could transform everything from national government systems to payment apps for coffee chains to the fight against climate change. They are also starting to make a difference to the world’s waste problem. As we shall see, this has exciting possibilities. Despite significant progress, the weight equivalent of one SUV is still going to landfill every year for each of the circa 500m people in the EU. Waste litters our oceans, beaches and wider environment, making it one of the pressing issues of our times – not least thanks to David Attenborough’s popular Blue Planet series for the BBC, whose last episode addressed waste directly. It is becoming harder to just shift it elsewhere – witness China’s recent ban on importing plastic waste, for example. Most countries are far behind Sweden, which has such a well developed network of waste-to-energy plants that it imports waste to feed them. So where do blockchains fit in? They are a sophisticated way of recording transactions without having one central institution like a bank controlling them. They comprise a series of blocks, each containing a set of transactions such as sales of assets or other transfers of value. It’s almost impossible to tamper with the information these blocks contain, since each has a unique tag of numbers and letters known as a cryptographic hash, overlaid with other complicated security mechanisms. Blockchains are so reliable that the ability of governments and central banks to control currency in future is very much in question. Various waste initiatives have seen potential to incorporate this technology. One is the Plastic Bank, a global recycling venture founded in Canada to reduce plastic waste in developing countries – so far Haiti, Peru, Colombia and the Philippines, with plans to extend this year. The initiative rewards people who bring plastic rubbish to bank recycling centres, and one option is blockchain-secured digital tokens. These can purchase things like food or phone-charging units in any store using the Plastic Bank app. The plastic is meanwhile bought by companies and recycled into new consumer products. The system attracts them because blockchain’s transparency means they can see where their investment goes. A more novel use of blockchains is meanwhile emerging in French rail. Waste management in stations has traditionally been chaotic, with up to six providers sorting endless rubbish. The central station in Lyon, for example, produces 360 tonnes of waste each year. A new system developed by SNCF subsidiary Arep uses blockchain to allow detailed information to be collected. There is a block for each station bin, which uses Bluetooth to continually update on quantities of each type of waste, which waste managers collected it and how it is being moved around. Station managers can use this data to see what providers have done and when. This enables them to improve waste management and optimise sorting. In a pilot, this saved almost €2,000 (£1,746) in one month in one station by facilitating a new system for collecting five different streams of waste separately. Blockchains are also being mooted to underpin a system for trading waste quotas similarly to how carbon quotas are traded under the EU Emissions Trading System. Using blockchains could help keep track of how much waste companies are producing, and could also help facilitate trading. These are various ways in which this technology can help address our waste problem, but they all focus on existing waste. They don’t look at the full life cycle of products from when they are created to when they are thrown away. For a proper life cycle approach to waste, we need to think about holding the companies responsible who made the products in the first place – as well as other companies in the supply chain, since they will potentially put pressure on the producers. We need to introduce standards to underpin this shift in responsibility, along with costly penalties for those who infringe them. Some incentives exist already – the EU’s extended producer responsibility, for example – but countries don’t tend to implement them because of issues around tracking the waste and enforcing the rules. Again, blockchain technologies could have a role here. When goods are produced, responsibility for them could be assigned. This would be recorded as a transaction to be stored in a block on the blockchain, identifying the product and the responsible party. Every time the product was transferred – when it was sold, say, or when it was disposed of in landfill – this would be recorded in a new transaction. This could all be accessible via a QR code stamped on each product. If the product then ended up as litter on a beach somewhere, the blockchain would provide a digital trail to identify who was responsible. It would be up to the government in question to determine where responsibility lay at any given time. Setting up this kind of system raises many practical considerations, of course: set-up costs, running costs, how to monitor and enforce it. But none are necessarily insurmountable. There are parallels, for example, with the EU’s system of requiring energy labels for household appliances to help consumers choose energy efficient products. When it comes to our worldwide problem with waste, it is time to think outside the box. Blockchains are already beginning to provide benefits in this area and they have much greater potential yet. If we can use them to build decentralised reliable networks for where rubbish has come from and where it ends up, it could lead to the breakthrough that has been eluding us for decades.::2018-04-09T13:59:24Z::Banks, Blockchain, Blue Planet, Canada, China, David Attenborough, France, Microplastics, Ocean plastic, SNCF, Sweden, Waste management, Waste to energy::Katrien Steenmans::Environment::https://images.theconversation.com/files/213580/original/file-20180406-125161-1ym6jw2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=100%2C667%2C4570%2C2281&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

Is non-custodial crypto under threat?::Two Bitcoin wallets are pulling out of the U.S. market — likely as a response to recent regulatory action taken against the non-custodial Samourai Wallet and indications that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the most popular Ethereum access point MetaMask. This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here. On Friday, Paris-based Bitcoin company Acinq announced it is pulling its popular Lightning network wallet, Phoenix, from app stores in the U.S., citing regulatory uncertainty. Users are recommended to close their channels and move their funds before access is terminated on May 3, 2023. See also: Custodial Wallets vs. Non-Custodial Crypto Wallets A day later, zkSNACKs announced it is closing off access to its privacy-preserving Wasabi Wallet in the U.S., saying “In light of recent announcements by U.S. authorities, zkSNACKs is now strictly prohibiting U.S. users from using its services,” in an April 27 statement. The point was echoed in Acinq’s statement, which said “recent announcements from U.S. authorities cast a doubt on whether self-custodial wallet providers, Lightning service providers, or even Lightning nodes could be considered Money Services Businesses and be regulated as such.” It’s unclear exactly what announcements Acinq is responding to, but legal action taken against Samourai Wallet and the recently disclosed Wells Notice inquiring about MetaMask indicate that non-custodial wallets could fall under U.S. regulatory purview. Further, an April 26 U.S. Department of Justice court document responding to a motion to dismiss a case against Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm indicates that even decentralized, non-custodial services likely need to implement KYC/AML and register with FinCEN, based on Section 1960 of the U.S. Code. “This would extend the MSB laws to encompass practically everything in the cryptocurrency space outside of a user who runs their own node,” crypto advocate Seth For Privacy wrote on X. “If no control is required for money transmission, then anything that makes it easier to use Bitcoin could fall into this overbroad definition.” Many observers in the crypto community have noted that the decision to pull Phoenix from the U.S. is regrettable, but largely understandable given the legal uncertainty. Jack Dorsey, founder of fintech firm Block, which built a hardware wallet, lamented that Acinq’s move “feels completely unnecessary.” “Agreed. This is not the way,” Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark said in response to Dorsey. The news comes off the heels of the latest crypto company indictment, the arrest of Samourai Wallet CEO Keonne Rodriguez and Chief Technology Officer William Hill, for running an unlicensed money transmission business. The DOJ alleges that Samourai processed over $2 billion in unlawful transactions, earning more than $4.5 million in fees since 2015. While legal experts have challenged the ground for going after non-custodial platforms that do not hold assets on behalf of users, authorities around the world have for years tried to bring these software systems under some sort of regulatory oversight. See also: UK Government Backtracks on Unhosted Wallet Data The E.U., for instance, has been mulling a 1,000 euro ($1,080) limit on crypto transactions from self-hosted crypto wallets as part of new anti-money laundering laws. U.S. authorities have also considered introducing legislation that would essentially ban “unhosted wallets,” which was successfully beaten back in 2022. But new legal actions and statements from authorities have upped the uncertainty, raising the prospect that many core crypto activities beyond building wallets could fall under money transmission laws, including even hosting a Lightning node. Like much else in crypto, these concerns will likely come down to court decisions, which is partially why Consensys, for one, has decided to sue the SEC. It’s unclear whether Phoenix and Wasabi will be the only wallets to leave the U.S., though at least one wallet company, Zeus, has vowed to stay. “We’re not going anywhere,” the Zeus account said on X. “We believe that Zeus is following the letter of the law right now. If the law changes or any judgments are made, we will make adjustments accordingly,” Zeus founder Evan Kaloudis said. “If Zeus falls, all other Lightning node operators are next. If Lightning node operators fall, self-custody is next. This is the hill to die on: self-custody. If you don’t agree, you were never in Bitcoin for the right reasons. So get behind us, or go home. Future generations are watching and depending on us.” See also: Samourai Wallet Charges Raise Existential Questions Edited by Benjamin Schiller.

Prominent technical analysts have declared that altcoins have potentially hit the market bottom, priming them for an impending bull run. This sentiment echoes multiple expert opinions, suggesting a pivotal shift in the cryptocurrency market. Michaël van de Poppe, a renowned technical analyst, affirmed that the altcoins have bottomed out. He also disclosed his current investment strategy, emphasizing his preference for altcoins due to their attractive pricing. “I skewed towards altcoins, and will be looking to rotate back towards Bitcoin later. Everything is so cheap,” Van de Poppe revealed. Van de Poppe specifically highlighted altcoins like Optimism (OP), Chainlink (LINK), Celestia (TIA), Woo (WOO), and Skale (SKL). He noted their potential to triple in value against Bitcoin with minimal risk. Similarly, another technical analyst, Luke Martin focused on the Ethereum ecosystem’s strength relative to other sectors. “This hasn’t happened in a while: Ethereum ecosystem looks the strongest vs almost every other crypto sector,” Martin remarked. He pointed to coins such as Optimism (OP), Arbitrum (ARB), and Polygon (MATIC). These are currently receiving significant attention in the crypto market. Read more: Which Are the Best Altcoins To Invest in April 2024? Adding to the bullish outlook, Lark Davis commented on the unique opportunity the current market conditions presented. According to him, this price dip presents the best opportunity in recent months to acquire altcoins. He explained the current price levels as a strategic timing for investors to engage before the anticipated bull run. “Looking at the current market conditions, I have to say this: There hasn’t been a better opportunity to accumulate altcoins in the past few months than this dip,” Davis said. Meanwhile, veteran investor Raoul Pal provided a broader perspective on the cyclical nature of cryptocurrency markets, predicting a parabolic rally known as “The Banana Zone.” According to Pal, this phase is expected to kick off with the Crypto Summer, leading into a mania phase in the fall.

He emphasized the importance of recognizing assets with compelling narratives and demonstrating substantial on-chain activity and scalability. As these analysts suggest, the market is setting up for a significant turnaround. For investors, the key to capitalizing on this potential bull run is identifying altcoins with strong fundamentals and strategic positioning.

Bitcoin (BTC) retook $70,000 Monday for the first time in about 10 days, according to Coinbase. The largest cryptocurrency gained 8% Monday to trade around $71,000 at time of publication. Ether similarly was on the rise Monday, gaining 7.5% in 24 hours to trade around $3,640, per Coinbase, at time of publication. Ether (ETH) is now about 23% lower than its all-time high of $4,721. If traders are buying ether with the hopes of a spot ETH ETF getting past the US Securities and Exchange Commission any time soon, analysts warn the investment vehicle faces an uphill battle with regulators.

Here’s why many are bearish “Social media is rife with enthusiasts that insist BlackRock never loses, so therefore an ETH spot ETF is a sure thing,” Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto is Macro Now newsletter, said. “Unfortunately, life doesn’t work that way, and BlackRock’s ETH conviction does not seem strong enough to press ahead in the face of SEC opposition.” Crypto-linked stocks including Coinbase (COIN) and MicroStrategy (MSTR) also spiked Monday, gaining 9% and 22%, respectively, toward the end of the session. Bitcoin mining operations Hut 8 Mining and Marathon Digital rose 8% and 3%, respectively, as well. The market moves come as digital asset investment products clocked their first week of outflows in almost two months last week, according to data from CoinShares. Investors pulled $942 million from crypto investment vehicles last week, the first outflow following a record 7-week run of inflows totalling more than $12 billion, CoinShares reported.

Someone who has only ever traded stocks may find this intimidating because it has its own personality.

There are people who defy the market and sell when they think it’s time, even though many people think asset ownership is the ideal strategy for investing in the cryptocurrency market.

This is not the stock market, where if you invest in a solid company, your portfolio is guaranteed to grow over time. The stock market can experience short-term ups and downs, but a good company with solid fundamentals always wins. This is not the case with cryptocurrency. For example, the market’s main asset, bitcoin, can drop significantly in a matter of hours or days. The reverse is also true; it is not unusual for an asset to double in value at the same time. The main difficulty in trading cryptocurrency is this volatility. However, forecasting these decreases and increases is not an exact science. Consider the impact of all the news about the Ethereum 2.0 testnet and the increasing price of Ethereum as one of the dependable techniques to determine whether an asset will increase in value. Despite the market’s volatility, keep in mind that many of the fundamental principles of investing in cryptocurrencies still hold true. It is nevertheless worthwhile to ride through the turbulent times if an asset appears to have a good fundamental purpose. The cases when you may want to sell cryptocurrency you own are described in the next sections. While they are not absolute laws, and you should do your own research and exercise caution, they are nevertheless important to keep in mind. There are times when a cryptocurrency project and corresponding token have a great start and make great demands. The token works well and shows an initial increase in value and then slowly loses value over a period of weeks or months. Sometimes a project just doesn’t make enough progress in development, resulting in a steady decline in value. Cryptocurrency team products are still in development. If these things don’t materialize, investors will know right away. Because of this, teams emphasize transparency and providing frequent updates. Without such communication, it is safe to conclude that the team is not developing as planned, which is a red flag that you might want to sell. On the other hand, if you have made a significant profit from buying a cryptocurrency – say, the asset has doubled in value since you bought it – then that might also be a good time to sell. A trader may want to take advantage of the benefits currently available, even though the project may well continue to grow because of its excellent growth, development and market position. Your choice is ultimately up to you. This may be a wise choice if you wish to reinvest your capital and cash out. Otherwise, if you believe the project has solid foundations, you can just keep your shares. Regardless of whether your investment made a positive or negative return, you might consider selling an item to reallocate your finances and either make a profit or reduce your losses. This is what many traders do, because more often than not it leads to negative asset values. You may be able to recover from a loss or take advantage of another attractive asset by taking everything you already have and investing it in another venture. Keep in mind, however, that nothing is guaranteed, so you must be sure of your choices. Stick to your investment in a solid project if you think it’s a good idea, and don’t reallocate money randomly. The news cycle makes or breaks the cryptocurrency market. While the stock market is also subject to it, the media has a much greater impact on cryptocurrencies. Given how open everything is and how influential influencers can be, it is not surprising that news can lead to double-digit fluctuations in cryptocurrencies. From time to time, you may see a string of bad news about a particular project, followed by a collapse in the value of the token. It is extremely important to follow the pulse of the market, because it can help you predict the direction in which the project will evolve. For instance, a number of unfavorable events occurred during the TerraUSD crash. Many investors cashed out their LUNA before some of the later developments, despite the token fast sinking. Although timing this properly won’t be possible, it really does help to keep this in mind when you are trading. Cryptocurrency is a type of digital currency in which, unlike a centralized body such as banks or the government, a decentralized system using cryptography is used to verify transactions and maintain records. Bitcoin is a decentralized digital money that does not require a middleman to be used for purchases, sales, or exchanges. It was developed by a group of unknown developers under the name Satoshi Nakamoto, who described it as an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof rather than faith. Investors should choose a cryptocurrency exchange to trade cryptocurrencies. To do so, it is important to consider a number of important factors, namely safety and security, the variety of cryptocurrencies available for trading, fees, rewards and regulatory compliance.

543::https://cryptobriefing.com/cme-prepares-spot-bitcoin-trading/::Crypto Briefing::article::CME prepares to launch spot Bitcoin trading — FT::CME's move into spot Bitcoin trading highlights Wall Street's growing interest in digital assets.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the world’s largest futures Bitcoin (BTC) trading platform, is preparing to introduce spot BTC trading in response to the increasing demand from Wall Street investors. According to an initial report from the Financial Times, CME has been in discussions with crypto traders to establish a regulated marketplace for spot BTC trading. This platform is expected to operate through EBS, a Swiss currency trading platform known for its strict regulations on crypto asset trading. The introduction of spot BTC trading on CME would enable traders to engage in basis trades, a strategy that aims to profit from the small price discrepancies between futures contracts and the underlying spot BTC. While the specifics of the trading platform are yet to be finalized, CME’s potential entry into the spot BTC market underscores the sustained interest of major Wall Street players in the crypto sector. This development comes on the heels of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January, signaling the growing acceptance and integration of digital assets into traditional financial markets. Recent SEC filings from various Wall Street financial institutions, such as Morgan Stanley and Millennium Management, reveal that many of these firms have exposure to crypto-related investment products. Vetle Lunde, a senior analyst at K33 Research, noted that as of March 31, 937 professional firms were invested in U.S. spot ETFs, compared to just 95 professional firms invested in gold ETFs during their first quarter. Retail investors own a majority of the float, with professional investors holding exposure of $11.06 billion. This ratio represents 18.7% of the BTC ETF assets under management (AUM). CME’s entry into spot Bitcoin trading could present significant competition for Binance, the largest crypto exchange by trading volume, which currently faces regulatory scrutiny worldwide. Prior to CME’s surge in activity, Binance had been the top Bitcoin futures platform globally. Aggregated data from Kaiko Research indicates that between top centralized exchanges, Binance accounts for 56% of BTC spot trading, followed by Coinbase and Bybit at 10.1% and 10.5%, respectively.

For example, the dotcom bubble and the collateralized debt obligation craze that led to the global financial crisis. The latest is the Blockchain. Most financial bubbles are based on a mistaken belief that somehow “this time it’s different” and the laws of economics are somehow suspended, only to find that the magic bullet is, in fact, a blank. Technically, Blockchain includes some neat ideas, even if most of them are decades old. And it’s not difficult to envisage niche situations where the technology could be useful, but operating in modern, high-volume financial markets is not one of them. Criticisms of Blockchain usually focus on technical issues around whether or not it can ever be scaled up to handle real-world markets, without compromising key principles. The jury is well and truly out on that question. But here the question is much more basic, can the Blockchain paradigm handle the complexity of modern financial markets? Blockchain has been called a “distributed ledger”. Think of that as an endless bank statement with each transaction (debit or credit) recorded in sequence from the first to the latest, but without the balance on the right-hand side! So how do you find out your account balance (or in financial market terms, your position or holdings)? Well, you have to start at the beginning and add up all of the pluses and minuses to get your latest balance. Since this is clearly time-consuming, what happens in practice is that people keep their latest balances elsewhere, in what are called “wallets” which, importantly, are not part of the Blockchain database model, and hence not covered by the safeguards inherent in that model. Why are balances not held in Blockchain? Because a balance changes every time a transaction is made. Balances are mutable, meaning they are liable to change and Blockchain does not support mutability. Thou shalt not change anything stored in Blockchain is the first commandment. Blockchain deals in individual, immutable and independent transactions and so does not support a fundamental concept of finance called “fungibility”. Fungibility means that every dollar in your account is the same, whether it was from your first pay packet or from this month’s salary. A dollar is a dollar, wherever it comes from. But not in Blockchain! Say you bought 75 shares of IBM last month and another 75 shares last week, and you wanted to sell 100 shares today. Easy with a stock broker, but tortuous in Blockchain, because you don’t actually have 100 shares, you own one group of 75 and another unrelated 75 shares. In financial markets, this is where brokers come in. If you have an account with a broker, they know that you have 100 shares (wherever they originally came from) and can find a buyer (or maybe several buyers) who is prepared to buy a total of 100 shares, for a price that is acceptable to you. In some markets, brokers, are prepared to buy at an acceptable price and then find sellers later, because brokers know what is going on in the market. Brokers sort out the real-world problem that individual buyers and sellers do not always have exactly equal and opposite financial needs. For that service, brokers charge a fee, or quote a “spread”, which pays for finding and matching those buyers and sellers who are actually empowered to buy and sell. In a Blockchain-driven market, without trusted intermediaries, buyers and sellers would individually incur the ‘search costs’ in finding suitable and trustworthy counterparties. In a mature market, these costs are in practice much higher than broker fees. Blockchain deals with transactions completed in the past and has nothing to contribute to real market concepts, such as price, value, profit or loss and risk. Taking our example of having bought 100 IBM shares (however they are accumulated). Having 100 shares is pretty irrelevant, unless we know what the shares are worth. The problem is that, in a heavily traded market, prices and hence the values of assets, such as IBM shares, change millisecond by millisecond. The value of our shareholdings then is mutable so cannot be reflected easily in Blockchain terms unless each change in value is recorded as a separate transaction. In financial markets, no-one cares what the value of our shares was 10 minutes ago, only what they are worth now - this instant. While a history of price changes is of general interest, and should be recorded, the hypothetical value of our share portfolio at each instant when a price changed in the past is of little note. An immutable history is just not needed. But while we are interested in value, we are more interested in our profit or loss, or the change in value of our whole portfolio of stocks. For a retail customer, profit or loss is usually calculated on a daily or even monthly basis, but for market players it is calculated in real time, second by second as prices change. Again profit or loss is a volatile, mutable quantity that is not suited to recording in a Blockchain database and again a history of profit or loss on each price change is not needed. A component of profit and loss that is vitally important is the income that is earned or the expenses paid when holding a position (for example: interest, dividends, bond coupons and option premiums). However, income or expenses are based not on transactions but the positions that were registered on a particular value date, which may or may not be the same as the transaction date. Other events may happen that change a balance but may or may not be reflected with a transaction. The most obvious of these is a “stock split” or “reverse stock split”, where the sum of all transactions no longer equals the new balance after a split is actioned. Another example of a non-transactional change is the unexpected redemption of a callable bond by an issuer, extinguishing the position (and by inference all of the transactions related to the position). Other examples include, the exercise of an American option by an investor, which will affect the risk in a portfolio. These examples show that there is not a simple correspondence between a set of transactions and the financial value of the impact of those transactions. In other words, in these instances, the Blockchain on its own does not reflect financial reality. But it doesn’t end there. While knowing the latest profit or loss is important, it is equally important to know what the risk in the position is. That is, how much profit or loss could be lost in the future, if the position is maintained. Again, risk is a mutable quantity, which changes not only when prices and values change but also as a result of other factors, such as the range (distribution) of historical price changes, interest rates, currency rates and even qualitative information, such as market commentary. However, risk is not an asset, it is a concept that only has real value, if it is hedged, or traded using derivatives. Blockchain deals with individual, unchanging transactions and there is no concept of linking transactions, because that implies mutability when transactions are dynamically linked and unlinked. If one wants to hedge a position (for example reducing or even leveraging risk), one can buy (or sell) hedges, such as exchange-traded futures or options. The portfolio then becomes not a ledger of unrelated transactions but, for trading purposes, a single position, with mutable values, profit or loss and risks (based in turn on the mutable prices, values, profit or loss and risk of the underlying assets). Linking of transactions is an integral part of modern financial markets. For example, in settling transaction or managing the risks in derivatives positions, it is not the gross value of the underlying transactions that matters, but the net of a particular set of transactions. In mature markets, concepts such as netting by novation (replacing multiple transactions by a new one), and portfolio compression (doing the same for multiple portfolios to reduce systemic risk) have been developed to reduce credit, operational and liquidity risks. And, mechanisms, such as margining and collateralization, have been developed to minimize credit risks that arise because a counter party may default on their obligations. Of course, margins and collateral values are mutable, changing as external markets change. Immutability then is not an absolute requirement of financial markets. However, retention of an audit trail of changes to a transaction, and related information, is indeed a requirement and this has been handled by paper and electronic technology since the early days of finance. An example of how successful financial markets grow is the evolution of the global Interest Rate Swaps (IRS) market, through various twists, turns and crises, as the swap became the primary mechanism for managing interest rate risk over the past 35 years. The first IRS contract was a one-off, bilateral contract negotiated in the early 1980s, between IBM and the World Bank. It’s the type of contract that could possibly be recorded in a Blockchain, albeit that the signing was at the endpoint of many months of tortuous negotiations on contractual terms and conditions. IRS is a very successful financial innovation that took off because it reduced overall credit risk, by trading changes in interest rates (an artificial asset) rather than by lending real money. But before long, the IRS market hit a brick wall, because bilateral negotiations were expensive. As a result, the International Swaps Dealers Association (ISDA) was formed to standardise the terms and conditions of swap contracts – a job that it is still doing well 30 years later, as financial markets continue to innovate. After several more years of growth, credit risk became a constraint in the IRS market and the concept of a “netting agreement” was developed, effectively treating many IRS transactions as one. In Blockchain terms, transactions were discharged or deleted and replaced by a separate new contract. Later in the evolution of IRS, the ISDA “credit support annexe” was developed that permitted collateralization to further reduce credit risk. Importantly, this innovation allowed many more parties to become part of the swaps market, which had been constrained to that point by credit risk. The market exploded and according to the Bank for International Settlements, contracts totalling some US$320 trillion in notional value were outstanding in 2015, up from less than US$50 trillion in 1998. It has been innovations such as netting by novation and collateralization coupled with standardisation of terms and conditions for different types of contract that has enabled this important market to grow. Bilateral contracts have given way to multilateral standards, in which trust is embedded. In modern financial markets, it’s not the transaction that is important but the net fungible position that is critical. Since Blockchain exists to ensure certainty and immutability, rather than flexibility and change, the concept would have been a deterrent rather than an enabler of growth in such an important market. Financial markets grow by innovation and, over centuries, new financial tools and techniques have been developed, enhanced and combined to reduce risks and increase trust in markets. Practitioners know that no system is perfect – people are smart – and so trust is forever a concept that must be actively managed. Those who claim to have found a magic bullet that will ensure trust for ever are naïve. They need to understand how real markets grow and prosper rather than concentrate on the minutiae of recording one of the first, and in most cases the least onerous, step - the initial transaction. Blockchain is to finance as bricklaying is to architecture. The bricks are of course important, but it is the myriad of ways that the building blocks can be combined into new, exciting and useful structures that is important. The individual bricks get lost in the overall aesthetic of the building. In finance, transactions are forgotten once they are placed in position, and the efficiency of the overall structure becomes the most important consideration.::2016-12-20T22:50:30Z::Banking, Blockchain, Finance, Markets, smart contracts::Pat McConnell::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/151107/original/image-20161220-26738-p68fgo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C201%2C2400%2C1164&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
545::https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/04/29/the-changing-face-of-risk-in-defi/::CoinDesk::article::The Changing Face of Risk in DeFi The Four Biggest Risks in Modern DeFi Transitioning from Technical to Economic Risk::The biggest risk factors in the new era of decentralized finance may be economic, not technical, says Jesus Rodriguez, CEO of IntoTheBlock. 1) Scale 2) Speed 3) Complexity 4) Interconnectivity::Decentralized finance (DeFi) is experiencing renewed momentum. The activity in new ecosystems, and the high yields, resemble the famous 2021 DeFi Summer. The variety of innovative protocols makes it incredibly hard for investors to keep up, while at the same time, the impressive growth raises concerns about risks accumulating in the DeFi ecosystem. You might have heard the doomsday analyses comparing the most successful protocols of this wave, like Ethena or Eigen Layer LRTs, with risk management disasters like Terra, without really providing any credible evidence of the parallels. Fact is, this new generation of fast-growing DeFi protocols is much more mature and a lot of thought has gone into risk management. However, there is still plenty of risk. Jesus Rodriguez, the CEO of IntoTheBlock, is a speaker on the AI Stage at Consensus 2024, May 29-31. The biggest risk in the current DeFi market is not based on mechanistic failures such as those that caused the collapse of Terra, but rather on three key factors: scale, complexity, and interconnectivity. Protocols in this DeFi wave have grown quite large in a matter of months, they enable more complex financial primitives, and they are incredibly interconnected. That combination of complexity, size and interconnectivity has drastically outpaced the capabilities of the risk models in the current DeFi market. In simple terms, there are plenty of risk conditions in the current DeFi markets for which we don’t have credible risk models. And that gap seems to be increasing, not shrinking. Risk has been part of the DeFi narrative since the beginning, and it's very easy to discuss it in broad, generic terms. This new era of DeFi brings novel innovations and has grown significantly fast. As a result, risk is taking on a different connotation than before. Taking a first-principles approach to analyze risk in this era of DeFi highlights four fundamental factors: scale, speed, complexity and interconnectivity. To illustrate these factors, consider the differences in quantifying risk for a basic AMM with a few hundred million in TVL versus an AMM that uses restaked assets with their corresponding point systems and introduces its own tokens and points. The former risk model can be solved with basic statistical or machine learning methods. The latter enters the domain of much more advanced branches of mathematics and economics such as complexity or chaos theory, which are nowhere near being applied in DeFi. Let’s look at the different factors in more detail. The principle of the relationship between risk and scale in DeFi is incredibly simple. In financial markets, modeling risk at a smaller scale, say a few hundred million, is very different than at a few hundred billion. At a larger scale, there are always risk conditions that surface that were not present at smaller scales. This principle certainly applies to DeFi as a parallel financial system with many interconnected primitives. Ethena is one of the most innovative projects of the current wave of DeFi and has attracted billions in TVL in just a few months. The biggest challenge for Ethena in the current market is to adapt its risk and insurance models to that scale in the event of funding rates going negative for a long time. The relationship between risk and speed is the traditional friction between growing too big too fast. As a risk condition, speed acts as an accelerator to scale. A protocol that goes from a few million to a few billion in TVL in just a few months might not have the time to adjust its risk models to the new scale before unforeseen risk conditions appear. The rapid rise of EigenLayer triggered an entire movement of LRTs, several of which grew to several billions in TVL in just a few months while still lacking basic functionalities such as withdrawals. The combination of speed and scale can exacerbate simple depegging conditions into really impactful risk factors in some of these protocols. The entire field of complexity theory was born to study systems that escape the laws of predictive models. Economic risk has been at the center of complexity theory almost since its early days as world economies rapidly outgrew risk models post-World War II. Modeling risk in a simple economic system is, well, just simple. In the new wave of DeFi, we have protocols such as Pendle or Gearbox, which abstract quite sophisticated primitives such as yield derivatives and leverage. The risk models for these protocols are fundamentally more difficult than those from the previous generation of DeFi protocols. Widely interconnected economic systems can be a nightmare from the risk perspective as any condition can have numerous cascading effects. However, interconnectivity is a natural step in the evolution of economic systems. The current DeFi ecosystem is much more interconnected than its predecessors. We have restaking derivatives in EigenLayer being tokenized and trading in pools in Pendle or being used with leverage in Gearbox. The result is that risk conditions in one protocol can rapidly permeate through different key building blocks of the DeFi ecosystem, which makes risk models incredibly challenging to build. Hacks and exploits have been the dominant risk theme in DeFi for the last few years, but that might be starting to change. The new generation of DeFi protocols is not only more innovative but also much more robust from the technical security standpoint. Auditing firms have gotten smarter, and protocols are taking security much more seriously. As an evolving financial system, the risk in DeFi seems to be transitioning from technical to economic. The large scale, fast growth speed, increasing complexity, and deep interconnectivity are moving DeFi into unforeseen territories from the risk perspective. With only a handful of companies working on risk in DeFi, the challenge is now to catch up. Edited by Benjamin Schiller.

Dogwifhat [WIF] has been the darling memecoin for the cryptocurrency sector since quite some time. With a large number of investors backing up the memecoin, the token witnessed massive growth. However, due to recent price fluctuations, traders have suffered significantly when it has come to WIF’s price action. Over the last 24 hours, more than $1 million worth of long positions have been liquidated. This has occurred due to the significant price decline that WIF saw during this period.  The price of the memecoin fell by 7.26% and was trading at $2.59 at the time of writing. This decline wasn’t a momentary correction and was part of a larger trend. Since the beginning of May, the price of WIF had declined. During this period, the token showcased multiple lows and lower highs, indicative of a bearish trend. The CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) also fell significantly during this period, implying that the overall flow of money into the token declined. Coupled with that, the RSI (Relative Strength Index)also fell, indicating that the bullish momentum around WIF had waned materially. If WIF’s price continues to face this kind of selling pressure, it could move past the $2.4794 level soon. Source: Trading View Due to this decline in price, traders had turned skeptical. AMBCrypto’s analysis of Coinglass’ data indicated that the percentage of short positions taken by the bears had increased to 52% over the last few days. The overall sentiment of the traders could further drive down WIF’s price going forward. Also, AMBCrypto’s examination of Santiment’s data revealed that Social Volume around WIF had declined significantly. This meant that the number of negative comments around the token had surged. The declining Social Volume coupled with the declining Weighted Sentiment can add significantly high amounts of selling pressure. Source: Santiment Is your portfolio green? Check out the WIF Profit Calculator What could add insult to injury for holders would be the overall state of the memecoin sector. Over the past week, WIF’s competitors, DOGE, SHIB and FLOKI have seen a positive surge in price. If this trend continues, WIF could lose significant market share.

Render is a platform that enables users to lend the unused GPU capacity of their home devices to support projects in rendering motion graphics and visual effects. In return, contributors receive Render tokens (RNDR), the native utility crypto of the Render Network. Render allows individuals to access underutilized computational resources affordably and efficiently by establishing a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. This approach streamlines the traditional methods of rendering and streaming 3D environments and other visual effects. “The main reason why Render token has exploded is because of its AI and GPU/ Nvidia’s narratives. The partnership with Apple also gives credibility and opens up a huge market opportunity for RNDR to showcase its technological edge over competitors.” Next-generation media production presents a significant challenge due to the substantial computing power it demands. Although powerful, today’s centralized GPU clouds must meet these growing requirements. I have a soloshow in just few days during Frieze nyc, and @rendernetwork once again saving my ass with their cloud rendering, thank you. Consequently, artists and creators frequently face a competitive scramble for GPU resources. These resources are crucial for traditional rendering cloud streaming and training AI models. This competition leads to a need for more available computing power and drives up costs, making it expensive for many artists. The need for more powerful rendering will grow as technology advances, especially with augmented and mixed-reality content. This demand intensifies existing shortages in computing resources. The crypto mining industry consumes vast GPU resources, yielding diminishing returns as rising energy costs outpace mining profits. This issue has grown more pronounced with the adoption of more energy-efficient blockchain technologies like proof-of-stake. ❐ key challenges The Render Network addresses three key challenges faced by its users: ‣ Scalability A primary advantage of $RNDR lies in its ability to provide a scalable GPU rendering network that can expand to accommodate user needs. Render Network proposes a potentially transformative solution in response to these challenges. It capitalizes on the underutilized GPU cycles by creating a decentralized network that connects content creators with GPU providers. The network enables creators needing additional computational power to access others’ idle GPU resources to render tasks. The Render Network simplifies the complex process of rendering and streaming detailed virtual creations. It alleviates the load on individual GPUs and reduces the overall demand on centralized resources by distributing GPU-based rendering jobs across a peer-to-peer network. This system makes rendering processes quicker and less costly for creators and allows GPU owners to monetize idle capacities. Render Network’s reach extends far beyond just rendering solutions. It offers a platform for various applications, from crowdsourcing 3D projects to managing digital rights. This creates an exciting new marketplace where digital ideas, assets, and applications can be funded and leveraged by anyone — from individual developers and artists to large studios. This, in turn, encourages innovation and collaboration among stakeholders. Render Network was founded in 2017 by Jules Urbach, the CEO of OTOY Inc. OTOY specializes in content creation and rendering software and technology, such as the OctaneRender. Urbach’s vision for the Render Network stemmed from his experiences and challenges within the graphics industry around the high costs and technological barriers that small creators face when accessing advanced rendering capabilities. Render Network is based in the Cayman Islands and is led by Tristan Relly, Head of Operations, and Andrew Hyde, Head of Communications. The core team behind Render Network comprises experts from both the tech and creative industries. The Render Network architecture includes a dual-layered system designed to streamline the rendering process using decentralized computing power. Here’s a quick look at its main components: The first layer of the Render Network architecture is the off-chain rendering network. This layer primarily consists of: A core network infrastructure comprising multiple servers facilitates the interaction between Creators and Node Operators. This setup ensures the efficient management of data exchange and task allocation across the network. This, in turn, helps maintain a smooth operational flow without central oversight. The second layer of the Render Network architecture revolves around blockchain technology, which handles financial transactions and ensures transparency: A key component in the Render Network’s operational model is the integration of OctaneBench. This tool benchmarks a GPU’s rendering performance using a metric called OctaneBench Points per Hour (OBh). This measurement is critical because it directly influences the cost of rendering tasks. OctaneBench ensures that pricing is fair based on the computational power of standardizing GPU performance. The platform dynamically calculates the pricing of tasks using a Multi-Tier Pricing (MTP) algorithm. This algorithm adjusts the cost based on the rendering task’s complexity and the GPU’s performance as measured by OctaneBench. This setup ensures that Creators can anticipate and control their rendering expenses based on predictable performance metrics. Render Network cuts through the noise with features that empower creators and GPU providers. Here’s what makes it a potential game-changer: RNDR functions primarily as a utility token, enabling the core operations of the Render Network. It facilitates transactions within the network, where content creators pay for rendering services using RNDR. This method simplifies the exchange process, directly linking the demand for rendering power with the supply provided by GPU operators. Currently, the network offers different tiers of service — Tier 1 (Trusted Partners), Tier 2 (Priority) and Tier 3 (Economy). Each tier is designed to cater to various speed, security, and price needs, offering flexibility to content creators depending on their specific project requirements and budget constraints. RNDR also serves as a reward mechanism for Node Operators, the GPU providers within the network. These operators can utilize their idle GPU resources to fulfill rendering jobs in exchange for RNDR tokens. Additionally, RNDR also acts as a governance token. It grants holders the power to influence the decision-making processes within the Render Network. This governance role empowers token holders to vote on key proposals that shape the network’s future, including protocol upgrades and policy changes. As of April 30, 2024, the RNDR token has a max supply of 536,870,912. Additionally, with more than 532 million tokens currently in circulation and a market capitalization of over $3.2 billion. The distribution of these tokens is strategically allocated to support various aspects of the network’s growth and sustainability: This allocation strategy aims to ensure the long-term development and scalability of the Render Network. The Render Network and its RNDR token are revolutionizing the digital content creation by providing decentralized rendering solutions and a utility token system for transactions. Here are some real-life applications of Render Network and the RNDR token: Render Network offers ample GPU resources that are ideal for creating high-quality graphics in films and games. Notably, artist Raoul Marks utilized the network to render the opening titles of “Westworld Season 4,” showcasing its capacity to support complex artistic projects. Render Network has expanded its activities in AI and machine learning. The platform provides computational resources for AI-generated graphics and prototypes, allowing cost-effective rendering of high-quality images for AI applications. “Generative AI on the inference and training side also fit to the kinds of GPUs that are already on Render. You don’t need an H100 to do training on generative video. One of the more exciting propositions for us is we look at the Apple ecosystem where you have GPUs with 120 gigabytes of video memory, those are out there in the tens of millions. Tapping into that is going to be a massive win over the cost of the scaling issues we have on centralized clouds. That’s where I see huge advantages of decentralized approaches like we have.” Render Network can come in handy for architects and product designers to produce high-quality 3D visualizations and virtual reality renders. It facilitates large-scale prototyping and detailed design analysis, which can improve design accuracy and presentation. RNDR is the primary currency for transactions within Render Network, where creators pay for GPU power to render graphics. Additionally, the network offers RNDR credits purchasable via bank cards, simplifying the payment process for crypto newbies. The Burn and Mint Equilibrium (BME) model enhances RNDR’s value by adjusting its supply based on network demand. Creators burn RNDR tokens to fund rendering jobs, ensuring ongoing demand. Node Operators earn these tokens as rewards, creating a dynamic economic ecosystem within the network. RNDR has shown a continued uptrend in its performance over extended periods, including gains year-on-year since its inception. This direction, alongside projections of growth in the rendering industry over the next decade, suggests a bright future for RNDR. However, like all crypto investments, risks due to market volatility and evolving regulations exist. To make an informed decision, thoroughly researching industry trends, guides, and potential risks is crucial. Understanding the opportunities and challenges can lead to more informed investment decisions for Render. Determining whether RNDR is a good investment depends on your individual risk tolerance, market conditions, and the overall performance of the cryptocurrency sector. Like all investments, RNDR carries risks, particularly due to the volatility of the crypto market. That said, the RNDR price has shown consistency over the long haul. For instance, it has increased more than 21,000% since launch and more than 350% year-on-year. Render is a platform that enables users to lend the unused GPU capacity of their home devices to support projects in rendering motion graphics and visual effects. In return, contributors receive Render tokens (RNDR), the native utility token of the Render Network. Render allows individuals to access underutilized computational resources affordably and efficiently by establishing a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. You can earn RNDR by providing GPU computing power to the Render Network, where users submit rendering jobs that require significant processing power. GPU providers connect their hardware to the network, complete rendering tasks, and receive RNDR tokens as payment. This system allows GPU owners to monetize idle computing resources effectively.

548::https://blockworks.co/news/paradigm-leads-monad-parallel-evm-fundraise::Blockworks::article::Paradigm leads $225M round for high-throughput blockchain Monad::Monad Labs is the developer behind a forthcoming layer-1 blockchain focused on high throughput and Ethereum compatibility.::Monad is set to go to mainnet by the end of 2024 Monad Labs and Adobe Stock modified by Blockworks Monad Labs, the developer behind a forthcoming layer-1 blockchain focused on high throughput and Ethereum compatibility, announced a hefty $225 million funding round led by Paradigm on Tuesday. Despite being far less active than in 2021, the crypto venture sector continues to show renewed vitality. Monad’s raise is the largest crypto venture round since Wormhole’s $225 million haul in November of last year. Electric Capital, Coinbase Capital and several other firms participated. The announcement comes as Solana, which also hopes to offer Ethereum-like features with better throughput, struggles to process the raft of transactions enabled by its low fees. Up to 77% of transactions were dropped instead of included in Solana blocks at times last week. Read more: Solana’s cheap fees are turning out to be a curse — for now When asked about Solana’s dropped transaction debacle, Monad co-founder and CEO Keone Hon gave a lengthy technical explanation. “Sorry this is a very long answer,” Hon parenthesized before diving into how RPC nodes handle spam. The co-founder of crypto’s latest mega-round recipient spent roughly a decade as a traditional finance quant before more recently working at Jump Crypto. At Monad, Hon and co. have generated excitement around an Ethereum Virtual Machine with parallel execution. The EVM is the software that powers Ethereum, a blockchain that can be slow and expensive. Parallel execution executes transactions simultaneously, rather than one at a time. Monad’s parallel EVM can theoretically run much quicker than Ethereum, hitting 10,000 transactions per second in its current “devnet” phase. Ethereum currently handles around 15 TPS, according to Etherscan. The idea of a parallel EVM has won some mindshare in crypto. Haseeb Qureshi, managing partner of Monad backer Dragonfly, said its Monad bet felt like “investing in more than just a team, but an idea,” on X. Dragonfly led Monad Labs’ $19 million seed round in February 2023. Hon said the Monad community is “almost like a Schelling point for really switched on people that care a lot about crypto.” Some Monad critics say it could suffer from state bloat, or inefficiency caused by processing huge amounts of transactions, when released into the wild. Solana also makes use of parallel processing, and it hasn’t wholly escaped the difficulty of scaling. Read more: Parallelized EVMs are gaining popularity, but they won’t scale blockchains alone Hon told Blockworks that the chain is spending time load testing and running edge case scenarios before Monad hits mainnet, a launch slated for later this year, according to Fortune. Monad’s CEO told Blockworks his blockchain will avoid Solana’s current transaction dropping woes because it lacks a scheduler — the piece of Solana that decides how transactions should be ordered in a block. Solana’s scheduler can hit conflicts and have trouble with transactions, Hon said. By contrast, Monad’s transactions are all linear and “there’s no way for transactions to affect other transactions’ actual scheduling.” Due to its scalability, Hon said Monad could be useful for creating consumer crypto apps. A popular app with a million daily active users executing around 50 transactions per day would require a blockchain to process 500 TPS, Hon estimated. “That one app would be half the throughput of Solana and would be 50x the throughput of Ethereum,” Hon said.

Stone’ Pleads Guilty to Wire Fraud::TJ Stone has pleaded guilty to wire fraud, deceiving investors with promises of high returns through a non-existent crypto wallet. He faces up to 20 years in prison.::Thomas John Sfraga, widely known in cryptocurrency circles as “TJ Stone,” has pleaded guilty to wire fraud charges in a Brooklyn federal court on Thursday. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Sfraga misled investors with promises of up to 60% returns within three months through a non-existent cryptocurrency digital wallet. Instead of delivering on these promises, he allegedly diverted the funds for personal use and to appease previous victims of his fraudulent schemes. “For years, Sfraga brazenly lied to friends, neighbors, and investors to swindle over $1.3 million of their hard-earned life savings,” stated Breon Peace, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York. Throwback to ‘Seinfeld’ Sfraga also purported ownership of “Vandelay Contracting Corp.” and “Build Strong Homes LLC,” companies with names evocative of a fictional business from the television show “Seinfeld.” This fictitious reference was part of his ploy to attract investors into funding non-existent construction projects. An FBI investigation revealed that Sfraga’s fraudulent activities extended into cryptocurrency staking, a process where digital assets support a blockchain network, offering potential returns through yields. According to a December 2023 FBI complaint, Sfraga misrepresented the risks involved in cryptocurrency staking to potential investors, falsely claiming it was an “ironclad situation” with “no risk.” With a background in real estate development, media relations, podcasting, and hosting cryptocurrency events in New York, Sfraga now faces up to 20 years in prison. He has also been ordered to pay $1.33 million in restitution. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

Share this article El Salvador has mined 473.5 Bitcoin (BTC) over the past three years using the geothermal power of the Tecapa volcano, Reuters reported today. Based on Bitcoin’s current price, this amount has translated into a $29 million increase in value. The nation’s total Bitcoin holdings now reach 5,750 BTC, equivalent to nearly $354 million, according to data from the Bitcoin Office, a government-owned agency. El Salvador’s mining initiative places the country at the forefront of eco-friendly crypto mining, a stark contrast to the energy-intensive methods typically scrutinized for their environmental impact. President Nayib Bukele, a vocal Bitcoin supporter, has been driving El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption since it became the country’s legal tender in 2021. In November 2022, Bukele implemented a national Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) strategy, aiming to buy one Bitcoin daily. This strategy has resulted in unrealized profits exceeding 43% on their Bitcoin holdings, according to data from Nayib Bukele Portfolio Tracker. El Salvador also took another step towards Bitcoin transparency. Yesterday, the Bitcoin Office announced the country’s new platform that allows anyone to view its Bitcoin investment data through a personalized mempool.

551::https://theconversation.com/can-you-truly-own-anything-in-the-metaverse-a-law-professor-explains-how-blockchains-and-nfts-dont-protect-virtual-property-179067::The Conversation::article::Can you truly own anything in the metaverse? A law professor explains how blockchains and NFTs don’t protect virtual property::NFTs are hailed as the foundation of the metaverse economy because they allow you to purchase unique digital assets, from art to real estate. But legally, you might not own what you think you do.::In 2021, an investment firm bought 2,000 acres of real estate for about US$4 million. Normally this would not make headlines, but in this case the land was virtual. It existed only in a metaverse platform called The Sandbox. By buying 792 non-fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, the firm then owned the equivalent of 1,200 city blocks. But did it? It turns out that legal ownership in the metaverse is not that simple. The prevailing but legally problematic narrative among crypto enthusiasts is that NFTs allow true ownership of digital items in the metaverse for two reasons: decentralization and interoperability. These two technological features have led some to claim that tokens provide indisputable proof of ownership, which can be used across various metaverse apps, environments and games. Because of this decentralization, some also claim that buying and selling virtual items can be done on the blockchain itself for whatever price you want, without any person or any company’s permission. Despite these claims, the legal status of virtual “owners” is significantly more complicated. In fact, the current ownership of metaverse assets is not governed by property law at all, but rather by contract law. As a legal scholar who studies property law, tech policy and legal ownership, I believe that what many companies are calling “ownership” in the metaverse is not the same as ownership in the physical world, and consumers are at risk of being swindled. When you buy an item in the metaverse, your purchase is recorded in a transaction on a blockchain, which is a digital ledger under nobody’s control and in which transaction records cannot be deleted or altered. Your purchase assigns you ownership of an NFT, which is simply a unique string of bits. You store the NFT in a crypto wallet that only you can open, and which you “carry” with you wherever you go in the metaverse. Each NFT is linked to a particular virtual item. It is easy to think that because your NFT is in your crypto wallet, no one can take your NFT-backed virtual apartment, outfit or magic wand away from you without access to your wallet’s private key. Because of this, many people think that the NFT and the digital item are one and the same. Even experts conflate NFTs with their respective digital goods, noting that because NFTs are personal property, they allow you to own digital goods in a virtual world. However, when you join a metaverse platform you must first agree to the platform’s terms of service, terms of use or end user license agreement. These are legally binding documents that define the rights and duties of the users and the metaverse platform. Unfortunately and unsurprisingly, almost no one actually reads the terms of service. In one study, only 1.7% of users found and questioned a “child assignment clause” embedded in a terms of service document. Everyone else unwittingly gave away their first-born child to the fictional online service provider. It is in these lengthy and sometimes incomprehensible documents where metaverse platforms spell out the legal nuances of virtual ownership. Unlike the blockchain itself, the terms of service for each metaverse platform are centralized and are under the complete control of a single company. This is extremely problematic for legal ownership. Interoperability and portability are defining features of the metaverse, meaning you should be able to carry your non-real-estate virtual property – your avatar, your digital art, your magic wand – from one virtual world to another. But today’s virtual worlds are not connected to one another, and there is nothing in an NFT itself that labels it as, say, a magic wand. As it stands, each platform needs to link NFTs to their own proprietary digital assets. Under the terms of service, the NFTs purchased and the digital goods received are almost never one and the same. NFTs exist on the blockchain. The land, goods and characters in the metaverse, on the other hand, exist on private servers running proprietary code with secured, inaccessible databases. This means that all visual and functional aspects of digital assets – the very features that give them any value – are not on the blockchain at all. These features are completely controlled by the private metaverse platforms and are subject to their unilateral control. Because of their terms of service, platforms can even legally delete or give your items away by delinking the digital assets from their original NFT identification codes. Ultimately, even though you may own the NFT that came with your digital purchase, you do not legally own or possess the digital assets themselves. Instead, the platforms merely grant you access to the digital assets and only for the length of time they want. For example, on one day you might own a $200,000 digital painting for your apartment in the metaverse, and the next day you may find yourself banned from the metaverse platform, and your painting, which was originally stored in its proprietary databases, deleted. Strictly speaking, you would still own the NFT on the blockchain with its original identification code, but it is now functionally useless and financially worthless. While admittedly jarring, this is not a far-fetched scenario. It might not be a wise business move for the platform company, but there’s nothing in the law to prevent it. Under the terms of use and premium NFT terms of use governing the $4 million’s worth of virtual real estate purchased on The Sandbox, the metaverse company – like many other NFT and metaverse platforms – reserves the right at its sole discretion to terminate your ability to use or even access your purchased digital assets. If The Sandbox “reasonably believes” you engaged in any of the platform’s prohibited activities, which require subjective judgments about whether you interfered with others’ “enjoyment” of the platform, it may immediately suspend or terminate your user account and delete your NFT’s images and descriptions from its platform. It can do this without any notice or liability to you. In fact, The Sandbox even claims the right in these cases to immediately confiscate any NFTs it deems you acquired as a result of the prohibited activities. How it would successfully confiscate blockchain-based NFTs is a technological mystery, but this raises further questions about the validity of what it calls virtual ownership. The Conversation reached out to The Sandbox for comment but did not receive a response. As if these clauses weren’t alarming enough, many metaverse platforms reserve the right to amend their terms of service at any time with little to no actual notice. This means that users would need to constantly refresh and reread the terms to ensure they do not engage in any recently banned behavior that could result in the deletion of their “purchased” assets or even their entire accounts. [Over 150,000 readers rely on The Conversation’s newsletters to understand the world. Sign up today.] Technology alone will not pave the way for true ownership of digital assets in the metaverse. NFTs cannot bypass the centralized control that metaverse platforms currently have and will continue to have under their contractual terms of service. Ultimately, legal reform alongside technological innovation is needed before the metaverse can mature into what it promises to become.::2022-04-21T12:19:38Z::Blockchain, Crypto, Cryptocurrency, Cryptowallet, Legal system, Metaverse, NFTs, Ownership, Property law, Property ownership, Technology, Terms of Service, Virtual reality, Virtual worlds::João Marinotti::Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/458455/original/file-20220418-22-wqead9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=318%2C0%2C2604%2C1302&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
552::https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/08/bitcoin-halving-is-not-a-volatility-event-analyst-says-as-implied-volatility-rises/::CoinDesk::article::Bitcoin Halving Is Not a Volatility Event, Analyst Says as Implied Volatility Rises::Options implied volatility is overpricing the event, Amberdata's Greg Magadini said.::Bitcoin's fourth mining-reward halving is due on April 20, when the blockchain's code will reduce the per-block bitcoin (BTC) issuance to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC. In the run-up, implied volatility (IV) on the largest cryptocurrency by market value has ticked higher, suggesting increased price turbulence in the days surrounding the quadrennial event. Still, one observer does not favor placing bullish bets on volatility. "From a qualitative perspective, I continue to believe paying a volatility premium for a highly predictable outcome (the BTC halving) isn't worth a volatility event premium," Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said in a newsletter on Monday. Traders typically place bullish bets on volatility ahead of binary events, for which the market outcome is uncertain. Moreover, uncertainty opens the door to pre- and post-event price turbulence and has traders buying both call and put options or volatility futures to profit from any price swings. But the impact of Bitcoin's reward halving on its native cryptocurrency and miners has been well documented. The cryptocurrency has historically produced stellar rallies in the 12-18 months following the halving. Read more: Bitcoin Halving, Explained It's important to note that major crypto events like Ethereum's Dencun upgrade, Shanghai upgrade, and spot BTC listings turned out to have little market impact, disappointing traders positioned for an event-led surge in price volatility. "Not to mention that nearly all the big volatility events in crypto (ETH PoS merge, ETH Shanghai upgrade, BTC spot ETF decision) had disappointed IV [implied volatility], buyers when RV [realized volatility] failed to materialize by very large margins," Magadini noted. Bitcoin's 30-day implied volatility, which gauges the expected price turbulence over four weeks, has increased to an annualized 75% from 68% in a week, according to Amberdata. Meanwhile, the 30-day volatility risk premium (VRP), or the gap between 30-day implied and realized volatilities, has surpassed 10% for the first time since early March. The VRP tends to rise ahead of and following extraordinary market events and can drop to low levels during extended periods of calm markets. "Options implied volatility is overpricing the event," Magadini said, noting the uptick in VRP. Bitcoin changed hands at $71,800 at press time, representing a 3.5% gain on the day. The cryptocurrency has risen over 11% since hitting lows near $64,500 on April 2, CoinDesk data show. The CoinDesk 20 Index, a measure of the broader crypto market, had added 3.8% over 24 hours.

553::https://beincrypto.com/altcoins-historic-buy-zone-report/::BeInCrypto::article::85% of Altcoins Are in Historic Buy Zone: Report::Recent analysis suggests a majority of altcoins present buy opportunities, according to the Market Value to Realized Value ratio.::We use cookies to improve your experience.  In the crypto market, recent analysis using suggests that a significant majority of altcoins are in a buy zone. This presents a potential opportunity for investors looking for favorable entry points. The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio compares the market capitalization of a cryptocurrency to its realized capitalization. Market capitalization refers to the total value of all coins in circulation, calculated by multiplying the current price of a crypto by the total number of coins. Realized capitalization, on the other hand, values each unit of crypto at the price it was last transacted, providing a nuanced view of the money invested over time. This differentiation is vital. While market capitalization can be inflated by speculative trading, realized capitalization represents a grounded assessment of an asset’s true value. A low MVRV ratio indicates that the price of a crypto might be undervalued relative to the actual amount of capital invested in it. Therefore, it suggests a potential buy signal for savvy investors.

Some of the most undervalued altcoins include Dego Finance (DEGO), Bella Protocol (BEL), and 0x Protocol (ZRX). Here is the full list of notable altcoins, all suggesting considerable undervaluation according to the latest data.

554::https://blockworks.co/news/adam-sullivan-core-scientific-bitcoin-halving::Blockworks::article::Core Scientific CEO: Machine buys, deleveraging key around Bitcoin halving::Mining giant Core Scientific is looking to purchase machines from struggling sector companies following next month’s Bitcoin halving.::The mining giant is looking to purchase machines from struggling sector companies following next month’s Bitcoin halving Core Scientific and Adobe Stock modified by Blockworks A couple months out of bankruptcy, bitcoin mining giant Core Scientific remains “hyper-focused” on de-leveraging its business and scooping up machines after the Bitcoin halving. Core Scientific CEO Adam Sullivan told Blockworks the company is gearing up its balance sheet to refresh its fleet with per-block mining rewards set to be cut in half next month. Mining rewards are set to drop from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC in late April due to a Bitcoin halving event that happens roughly every four years. The occurrence is expected to put a segment of the industry’s companies under financial stress. At that point, Core Scientific expects to purchase machines from struggling companies in the sector unable to afford parts of their existing orders. Read more: The next bitcoin halving is coming. Here’s what you need to know The Texas-based company will be able to realize that vision faster if able to unlock cash tied up in convertible debt securities by reaching certain share price levels. The company emerged out of bankruptcy in January after becoming unable to repay an equipment financing loan in late 2022. Its reorganization plan reduced Core Scientific’s net debt to $571 million by converting equipment lender and convertible note holder debt to equity. Core Scientific’s share price was $3.39 at the time of publishing. The stock price hitting $6.81 would spur the conversion of its so-called tranche 1 warrants, unlocking $670 million in cash and eliminating the $260 million convert principal. “All of those things would provide us an opportunity here to really outpace our competitors in a way that everyone saw us do for multiple years as we ramped up through 2022,” Sullivan told Blockworks. Joe Flynn, an analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading, wrote in a March 13 note that Core Scientific is “well positioned going” into the halving. The company’s all-in hash cost was at roughly $0.04, which Flynn noted was on “the low-end of the public miner cost curve” and could lead to “continued strong profitability” post halving. The company operated 222,000 bitcoin miners for self-mining and hosting — with an energized hash rate of 25.1 exahashes per second (EH/s) — as of Feb. 29. “While we acknowledge [Core Scientific’s] hash rate growth is likely capped relative to other miners and there remain a lot of unknowns regarding their ability to deliver and/or raise cash, we continue to like [its margins post-halving and potential for operating leverage on hash price growth off a $0.06 floor during [2024’s second half],” Flynn wrote. Keep reading for more excerpts from Blockworks’ interview with Sullivan. Blockworks: How do you expect the upcoming Bitcoin halving to impact the mining industry this time around? Sullivan: We’re going to see an acceleration of what we saw in 2022. Lower market cap companies — or companies that have struggled to raise capital or don’t have a fortified balance sheet going into the halving — are going to have a very difficult time operating. It’s very similar to what we saw in 2022. The first thing companies are going to do is sell facilities to try to raise cash. Read more: Mining giant Marathon set to buy another site just weeks ahead of bitcoin halving We’re actually kind of seeing that accelerate right now, and I think post-halving we’re going to see that continue. Blockworks: What do those post-halving scenarios mean for Core Scientific’s strategy? Sullivan: We recognize there’s going to be opportunities to upgrade machine fleets in challenging times, and so that’s why we’re putting cash on the balance sheet today. There’s going to be a machine re-pricing prior to, or after, the halving. Right now we’re seeing machine pricing go much, much higher … but we’re not going to be in that environment post-halving. So what we’re doing is preparing for the opportunistic purchase of machines post-halving where we know … a number of people are going to be selling off parts of their S-21 orders that they’ve made today. This is the exact same playbook that happened in 2021. People overcommit and then they end up having to sell off parts of their orders in the following year. We fully expect that to occur again. Blockworks: What else might Core be looking out for on the M&A front? In addition to machines, could it look to buy facilities? Sullivan: For Core Scientific, if we’re going to be evaluating a facility, it really needs to have a strong competitive advantage that’s going to last a long time. Because right now, our facility fleet spans and gives us the opportunities to have either very low-cost power with lower uptime, which is where we can put less efficient machines. And we also have sites that have extraordinarily high uptime and a little bit higher power costs that are still competitive in this industry where we can put new machines. As we look forward, [we have] a much more, I would call it, pragmatic growth strategy on the infrastructure side. We’re going to be much more opportunistic on the machine purchase side … in not only 2024, but 2025, because our opportunity to grow our exahash is really within our existing facility base. Blockworks: What did going bankrupt teach Core Scientific about its business and impact the way it might view its future growth strategy? Sullivan: We’re a case study, right, in bitcoin mining growth at all costs. In 2021 we already had this scale that was pretty much uncatchable. We had the largest machine purchases in the industry. And then by the time we got to 2022, because that was driven mainly by a lot of debt capital, we had four projects going on for site development. We had large machine orders being delivered. Between when you start putting money into the ground on infrastructure and when you start putting money into machines, there’s a delay before those start cash flowing. You need to be prepared for high volatility moments, and frankly that was something we weren’t prepared for in 2022. We had over $600 million in bitcoin on the balance sheet, and when bitcoin started to trade down, it put not only our income statement into a challenging environment, but our balance sheet as well. That growth-at-all-costs mindset does have its challenges. And so when we think about our future growth, luckily we’re in a very strong position from an infrastructure perspective where we’ve already spent the money on the long-lead items. So for us to bring any additional megawatts online, that’s counted in months, it’s not counted in years. And that’s single-digit months, which is fantastic for us as a business — being able to not only plan what infrastructure’s going to come online but match that with machine orders. Blockworks: Core Scientific is now leasing capacity in its Austin datacenter to cloud provider CoreWeave as part of a broader shift toward hosting infrastructure related to artificial intelligence and high-performance computing (HPC). What do you expect the future of that business line to look like? Sullivan: The long-term goal for this is to take some of the facilities that we believe might be less competitive in 2028 and start to work through the process of converting those to HPC. Read more: Miners continue money-conscious moves ahead of the Bitcoin halving The clients are out there. …They’ve signed contracts, whether it be with the US government or Microsoft or any of the other large providers who are also struggling to find power. And we have the ability to pull all of that forward and beat other companies by years to getting megawatts up and operational. It will increase the margin of our mining business … and will bring forward a new stable free cash flowing business line that we think investors will find very attractive.

555::https://coinatory.com/cryptocurrency-articles/what-is-cryptocurrency-good-for-how-can-i-use-crypto-7136/::Coinatory::article::What is cryptocurrency good for? How can I use crypto?::Learn what crypto is really good for and discover practical ways to use it in everyday life. Start your crypto journey today.::That’s what we examine here: What is cryptocurrency actually good for? When it comes to cryptocurrencies, there are two camps. There are those who believe that cryptocurrency is nothing more than a fad that will disappear. On the other hand, there is the louder camp that extols the benefits of crypto and its impact on finance, and they have good reason to do so. But is there truth in their predictions? And how much truth is there? Of course, there is obviously some power in technology and the asset class if a wide range of people enter the market. Some of the biggest brands and companies in the world are also in technology and ancillary applications. It is difficult to summarize the extremely diverse development space in the cryptocurrency industry, but here are a few examples. Thanks to decentralized finance (DeFi) technology, anyone can get loans against collateral. Decentralized cab ordering apps compete with Uber’s decentralized power distribution networks. Almost all interactions can be decentralized, and some industries, such as finance, supply chain, medicine and real estate, can benefit more than others. In addition to these benefits, there are several others. Finance is such a popular application because cryptocurrency allows you to make transactions at a very low cost – under normal circumstances. That’s why financial institutions are exploring the technology themselves. SWIFT may not last very long at the rate the crypto industry is moving. Transaction fees were once a concern for Bitcoin, but that too has been assuaged as the average fee hovers around $1 as of September 2022. This is especially useful for international transfers, as international transfer fees traditionally average at 2% to 4%. You can transfer a million dollars to someone on the other side of the world almost instantly and at the lowest cost, such as when a $98.3 million bitcoin transaction was transferred for just $3.3. This leads to another widely advertised use case that is not as successful as cross-border transfers: everyday shopping. Shopping is an app that is growing in popularity, and some major retailers already accept cryptocurrency. Microsoft, The Home Depot and Newegg are just some of the companies that have been involved in cryptocurrency purchases. People can use cryptocurrency to buy groceries at Whole Foods and hardware at The Home Depot. However, the idea of using cryptocurrency daily to buy products has several hurdles to overcome, namely the volatility of the asset class, government control, and the technical ability to process such transactions at scale. Cryptocurrency can also be used as an asset to store wealth, protect against inflation, and as a means to buy real estate. Several companies have launched trading platforms that allow users to buy real estate for cryptocurrency. There are no middlemen, resulting in savings for buyers and sellers. Another useful benefit is shared ownership, which can lower the barrier to entry into real estate ownership. Cryptocurrency accounts have become a growing trend, allowing users to earn from their cryptoassets that would otherwise be idle. These accounts simply charge a fixed rate that varies depending on the asset, and rewards are automatically credited to the account. For example, Binance has the Binance Earn service, which also offers both flexible and fixed rate features. Users can use a token such as Cardano (ADA) and earn interest over time.

One platform that allows this is Travala, which has more than 3 million travel products worldwide. You can book lodging, flights, and travel activities using cryptocurrencies, and most major assets are supported. Charity has become another unexpected use of cryptocurrencies, and many platforms have been developed specifically for this purpose. Some people use cryptocurrencies for charity because they provide more privacy and the payment method is quick and easy. Ukraine has received more than $100 million in cryptocurrency donations, and President Vladimir Zelensky said this could be a “breakthrough from an economic point of view. Another example is The Giving Block, a platform with thousands of nonprofits where users can donate cryptocurrency.

556::https://cryptobriefing.com/pre-token-market-insights/::Crypto Briefing::article::Pre-token markets can revolutionize interactions with financial instruments: Keyrock report::Analysts see a predictive power in pre-TGE trading on future token prices.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Pre-token trading platforms are still an unpredictable market for buyers and sellers, according to a recent Keyrock report. Despite offering early access to tokens before they launch, data gathered by Keyrock suggests few buyers find profits in these platforms. Nevertheless, the speculation around the token price serves as a crucial barometer for initial market reactions and investor mood. In cases such as JUP and W, the price after the token generation event (TGE) showed substantial convergence with the pre-market prices. However, not all tokens behave like JUP and W, as some display significant price variances, the report shows. Notably, Whales Market often commands a premium over AEVO or Hyperliquid. Moreover, pre-token markets diverge in trading activity, which may lead to inconsistent price prediction. “Trading a token before its official launch is a pioneering idea. Yet, if pre-token markets occasionally struggle to agree on the correct price, can they truly forecast post-TGE prices accurately? This raises critical questions: can these markets be trusted, and are they genuinely efficient?,” the report highlights. To track the post-TGE activity, Keyrock created index prices that uses market caps as weights to determine an average. In essence, the pre-TGE index price should converge post-TGE. They analyzed trading activity on AEVO, Hyperliquid, and Whales Market for ALT, DYM, ENA, JUP, Pixels, Portal, STRK, TNSR, and W. Keyrock analysts explain that the navy blue line displayed in the image above tracks the index price post-TGE, acting as a benchmark. and it should align with the pre-token market index price over time. Although AEVO and Hyperliquid indexes converge close to the TGE, the Whales Market line shows a dramatic spike just days before TGE, likely fuelled by a palpable wave of “fear of missing out.” “These observations offer more than mere data points; they provide profound insights into the emotional and psychological dynamics that drive market behavior pre-TGE. Understanding these is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the volatile waters of pre-token launches.” The report then finds out that the market landscape does not favor a consistent set of winners, as both buyers and sellers can realize significant gains depending on their timing. Another common characteristic of pre-token markets is the points system, which consists of users selling their points used to qualify for airdrops. The report finds a lack of correlation between price movements and these points in pre-markets. “Blast and Parcl, for instance, exhibit unique trading patterns in their token prices that do not mirror their points markets. This disconnection underscores a broader issue: the glaring lack of liquidity that obstructs genuine price discovery, resulting in volatilities that are 10-20 times higher in pre-token markets than those seen post-TGE.” Yet, even with the flaws identified by Keyrock, they still see this as a “development that isn’t merely captivating for the industry,” with the potential to reshape the wider financial landscape. The possibility of trading assets before they truly materialize can revolutionize the way investors interact with financial instruments, concludes the report.

557::https://theconversation.com/blockchain-technology-could-be-a-game-changer-for-developing-communities-52896::The Conversation::article::Blockchain technology could be a game changer for developing communities::Many developing economies have already embraced the sharing economy, now they have a platform to get more out of it.::Companies around the world are exploring blockchain, the technology underpinning digital currency bitcoin. In this Blockchain unleashed series, we investigate the many possible use cases for the blockchain, from the novel to the transformative. Blockchain technology is being developed in everything from financial technology companies to the GLAM industries. Some, such as Backfeed, are using blockchain for decentralised coordination through smart contracts. As the recent attack on the DAO has revealed, blockchain-based innovations can also create social harm by being difficult to fix when things go wrong. While it is likely that platforms such as Ethereum will evolve to deal with these risks, a further consideration is who will reap the benefits of blockchain applications in the long term. To understand that, we need to consider the infrastructures on which these technologies are run and accessed, not just the code. Originally developed to support bitcoin, Blockchain is essentially a public ledger. It’s like a giant spreadsheet for recording assets, which can be utilised for any form of exchange and which no individual entity controls. By providing a secure and distributed means of authentication and recording, Blockchain eliminates the need for intermediaries that pull information to verify transactions. The technology can therefore be used for autonomous machine-to-machine communications, taking the Internet of Things and the sharing economy to the next level (for instance, cars that manage their own rental and re-fuelling). The benefits of blockchain technology for developing economies have so far only been discussed in terms of remittance payments and providing an alternative currency in unstable fiscal environments. However it could also be applied in sharing economies that are present in some developing communities, just like the one I observed during field work in the Kedaya Telang Usan area in Sarawak, Malaysia. In a sharing economy, people make use of their excess assets by charging others to access them – houses for holiday accommodation, garages for storage, cars (and their drivers) for rides. During British colonial rule, the Orang Ulu began to grow crops for profit not just for subsistence, and out of this came the kinds of payment for services that characterise the sharing economy. One of my fellow researchers, Simpson Njock, a Kenyah man from the region, said it was once the case that you had to share a wild boar, but now if someone asks you for some of your wild boar you say to them “how much?” Until logging roads were built a decade ago, it would take the Orang Ulu days to get to their kampung (village) by longboat. As only a small number of people in each kampung own a car, the Orang Ulu developed a ride-sharing system, whereby you pay someone with a ute to take you where you need to go - a lot like ride sharing service Uber but without the internet platform. In another example, the house of the headman may include rooms for those on their way upriver. These systems have also developed in a region where many fall into the unbanked category (those without bank accounts or credit) and live a largely subsistence lifestyle, but where money is required for schooling, medical treatment, and home maintenance. Many make that money from handicrafts or food they have grown on their padi farms. Some goods are bartered rather than sold. Using technology in development projects has been controversial, with research showing some projects reinforce exploitative economic and political hierarchies whilst claiming to encourage entrepreneurship from the so-called “bottom of the pyramid”. Blockchain will not necessarily resolve the complexities of the development industry, but it might assist the coordination of existing systems, making them more efficient, rather than imposing different ones. For instance, it could make possible a shift from forest industries, such as logging and oil palm, to economies that rely on a healthy forest, where natural heritage and culture are valued rather than diminished. In the nearby Bario region, a technology project has helped facilitate local tourism since 1998, primarily through websites that promote home stays. Technology is already changing life in remote Sarawak, enabling people to coordinate car rides and handicraft sales through instant messaging and social media. Emerging peer-to-peer platforms could be of significant further economic benefit through more efficient and automated systems, without the high transaction costs or standards required by commercial platforms. The most interesting and important blockchain transformations could be those built for economies that have been underserved by established financial institutions and classified as ‘informal’. Current blockchain debates are focused on the conflicts between law and automated governance. We need to remember that there are many spheres of interaction that have not be well served by markets, regulations and institutions, which could benefit from technologies that reduce the need to interact with them while providing simple, trusted transactions. Such possibilities are a long way off, and not just because of bugs in the code. For these technologies to run, there must be reliable connectivity and infrastructure. While some communities have mobile broadband base stations, we found that these are often poorly maintained or suffering from congestion. The possibilities for economic development via blockchain applications will be nothing more than an idealistic and novel concept unless more fundamental digital infrastructure needs are addressed.::2016-07-17T20:05:49Z::Blockchain, Blockchain unleashed, Developing world, Sharing economy::Ellie Rennie::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/130812/original/image-20160718-2133-1dtl55q.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

Unlike many ICOs, or various DeFi rugs, or vaporware L2 roll-ups, memecoins do not pretend to have anything other than the animal spirits of story and sentiment. They are an honest product, doing exactly as advertised. It is those other projects, the ones that promise the world but deliver failure, that are deceiving investors. But there is also a profound misunderstanding in this point of view. The anarchist rebel thinks it is cool to say that nothing matters and all should be torn down. The builder understands that, once the rebellion has exposed the orthodoxy for its weakness, new systems of meaning and value have to be built to replace them. Nothingness is not a goal. Crypto is intended to be a positive-sum game, not a dog-eat-dog nightmare. Just because some things are meaningless,does not mean that all things are meaningless. We are here to build the new things using profound tools unlocked for us by brilliant technologists. Those that see nothing but opportunism and financial games may become richer on paper. But they have made the entire space poorer as a result. My concern these days is for the evolution of the crypto-AI sector. Generative AI will bring enormous economic growth to the world in a natively digital form. It exposes privacy, ownership, and financial issues that Web3 is uniquely positioned to solve. AI will test the economic infrastructure that blockchain has built over the last 15 years, and whether its promises of self-sovereignty actually hold true. As a result, AI gives us a path to pull Web3 away from the over-reliance on being a casino as its core value proposition -- a casino that often hasn’t been honest about being a casino. But the usual failure mode is rearing its head. We see large AI-themed projects launching as bridges to nowhere, using the narrative of AI to create marketing that masks the underlying reality – which is rushed vaporware with tokenomics that induces investors to invest, stake or sell. Raising money in itself should not be a sufficient goal for an entrepreneur. Designing financial incentives that attract investors to an AI-themed casino is a disservice to the important role that Web3 has to play in the next century of economic activity. Throw away the financial nihilism! We must not undermine one of the greatest opportunities by treating it as a costume to wear on fundraising day. Instead, look to the classic advice given to people starting businesses: Find real customers looking to buy products and services to solve actual problems, and design open protocols and networks to deliver those products and services better than the centralized technology firms. We can use the power of the crowd, community marketing and engagement, and tokenized protocol ownership to outcompete walled gardens and software cathedrals. The Internet and Linux have done it before us, and we can do it again by building the techno-economic architecture for the AI age. Gambling that opportunity away for quick returns in a single market cycle would be a profound error. Edited by Benjamin Schiller.

559::https://beincrypto.com/altcoin-holders-are-losing-money/::BeInCrypto::article::Over 80% of Algorand (ALGO), Sandbox (SAND), Arbitrum (ARB) Holders Are Losing Money::Significant losses grip Algorand, Sandbox, Arbitrum, and other altcoin holders. IntoTheBlock analysis highlights new opportunities.::We use cookies to improve your experience.  A recent analysis by IntoTheBlock reveals a troubling trend for holders of some notable altcoins. Indeed, over 80% of investors in Algorand (ALGO), Sandbox (SAND), and Arbitrum (ARB) are currently facing losses. IntoTheBlock explained that Algorand is at the forefront of the troubling trend, with a staggering 91% of its holders in the red. However, Marc Vanlerberghe, CMO of the Algorand Foundation, maintains that the network remains one of the best blockchains for solutions that scale and that the future is bright despite ALGO’s price performance. “Algorand has rock-solid fundamentals. Thanks to its reliability (the network has never been down in 5 years), impressive speed (up to 10,000 transactions per second), and low-transaction fees (.001 ALGO), Algorand’s potential to power solutions across industries such as finance, real estate, social impact and more is immense,” Vanlerberghe told BeInCrypto. Other altcoins like Sandbox and Arbitrum are not far behind, marking around 80% of their investors with depreciated altcoin portfolios. Moreover, cryptocurrencies such as Axie Infinity (AXS), Chiliz (CHZ), Cardano (ADA), Aave (AAVE), Lido DAO (LDO), Uniswap (UNI), and Chainlink (LINK) also show a high percentage of holders at a loss but to a lesser extent. The surge in loss-making accounts is attributed to the volatile nature of the crypto market. It has seen significant price fluctuations over the past months. For investors, the downward trend poses concerns but highlights a crucial aspect of market dynamics — the potential for recovery and gain amidst apparent downtrends. Indeed, despite these daunting figures, IntoTheBlock said there is a silver lining. Assets like Algorand, Sandbox, and Arbitrum offer potential opportunities for savvy investors. “These assets can present great opportunities, as long as they show strong fundamentals and signs of on-chain activity and growth,” IntoTheBlock explained.

There are times in every market cycle where stuff just goes up because bitcoin isn’t going down. Today is one of those days. Internet computer (ICP) is the best performing crypto at the top end of the table, gaining 20%. The pupper with the woolly hat (WIF) is close behind with a 16% bounce. WIF spent most of the past week in the red after a healthy 30% retracement, and is still one of the worst performing top-100 cryptocurrencies over the past seven days. Cryptocurrencies for alt blockchains Quant (QNT), NEAR and TON (TON) are close behind, with between 15% and 11% over the past day. Ondo DAO (ONDO), the governance token for the treasury-focused DeFi protocol Flux Finance, is somewhere in the middle, having gained 13.4% across the past 24 hours and a healthy 86% over the past week. Bitcoin (BTC) at $67,000 is otherwise up 2.1% to ether’s (ETH) 1.4%. eCash (XEC), ronin (RON) and stacks (STX) are the worst of the front-page, each slipping between 6.5% and 4.2% today as of 9:15 am ET. Polygon PoS has eclipsed Ethereum mainnet for monthly active unique addresses for the first time ever — but the latter’s layer-2s are together pulling in even more. Bitcoin has always had far more unique active addresses than Ethereum. Five years ago, in 2019, Bitcoin had nearly four times as many: 12.2 million to 3.2 million. Ethereum mainnet’s unique active addresses more than doubled over the next two years. The network’s count has however been shrinking ever since it peaked at 7.57 million in June 2021, around the top of the previous bull market. All growth has instead shifted to popular layer-2s Arbitrum, Optimism, Base and zkSync, which have altogether seen more active addresses per month than Ethereum mainnet since July last year.

Crypto stocks have inched higher but it doesn’t exactly feel like they’ve earned those gains. Bitcoin has decoupled from tech stocks over the past two weeks. BTC’s 30-day correlation with QQQ — which tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 — hit 68% on March 14, per TradingView. At the time, both QQQ and bitcoin hovered around their respective all-time highs. Now, bitcoin is only 10% correlated with the cubes and could soon return to inverse territory. Bitcoin has often traded with negative correlation with tech stocks over the past year, after spending most of 2022 trading more in tandem. Coinbase’s correlation with tech stocks hit its lowest point ever last month, sinking as low as -65%. It has since swung back up to 68% over the past week.

Pros and cons of altcoins explained::Altcoins are generally defined as all cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin (BTC). Сomprehensive information about altcoins: prons and cons::Altcoins are generally defined as all cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin (BTC). However, some people think that altcoins are all cryptocurrencies except Bitcoin and Etherium (ETH) because most cryptocurrencies branch off into one of the two. Some altcoins use different consensus mechanisms to verify transactions and open new blocks or try to distinguish themselves from Bitcoin and Etherium by providing new or additional features or targets. Most altcoins are developed and released by developers who have a different vision or use of their tokens or cryptocurrency. Learn more about altcoins and how they differ from bitcoins. “Altcoin” is a combination of the two words “alternative” and “coin. It is commonly used to include all cryptocurrencies and tokens that are not bitcoins. Altcoins refer to blockchains for which they were specifically designed. Many of them are forks – separations of blockchain incompatible with the original chain – from Bitcoin and Etherium. These forks usually have more than one reason for originating. In most cases, a group of developers disagree with others and go off to create their own coin. Many altcoins are used in their respective blockchains to achieve something, such as ether, which is used in Ethereum to pay transaction fees. Some developers have created forks of Bitcoin and reappeared in an attempt to compete with Bitcoin as a payment method, such as Bitcoin Cash. Others splurge and market themselves as a way to raise funds for specific projects. For example, the Bananacoin token branched off Ethereum and appeared in 2017 as a way to raise funds for a banana plantation in Laos that claimed to grow organic bananas. Altcoins attempt to improve the perceived limitations of any cryptocurrency and blockchain from which they are branched out or with which they compete. The first altcoin was Litecoin, branched off the Bitcoin blockchain in 2011. Litecoin uses a different Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism than Bitcoin, called Scrypt (pronounced es-crypt), which is less energy intensive and faster than Bitcoin. SHA-256 PoW consensus mechanism. Ethereum is another altcoin. However, it is not descended from Bitcoin. It was developed by Vitalik Buterin, Dr. Gavin Wood, and several others to support Ethereum, the world’s largest scalable blockchain-based virtual machine. Ether (ETH) is used to pay network members for the transaction validation work their machines do. Get in touch: Ethereum news Altcoins come in many flavors and categories. Here’s a brief description of some types of altcoins and what they are for. As the name implies, payment tokens are intended to be used as currency – to exchange value between parties. Bitcoin is a prime example of a payment token. Cryptocurrency trading and use has been marked by volatility since its launch. Stablecoins seek to reduce this overall volatility by tying their value to a basket of commodities, such as fiat currencies, precious metals or other cryptocurrencies. The basket is intended to be used as a reserve for holders to redeem if the cryptocurrency fails or runs into problems. Stablecoin prices should not fluctuate beyond a narrow range. Known stablecoins include USDT Tether, DAI MakerDAO and USD Coin (USDC). In March 2021, payment processing giant Visa Inc. (V) announced that it would begin conducting some transactions on its USDC network via Ethereum blockchain, and later in 2021 plans to deploy additional settlement capacity in Stablecoin. Security tokens are tokenized assets offered in stock markets. Tokenization is the transfer of value from an asset to a token, which then becomes available to investors. Any asset can be tokenized, such as real estate or stocks. For this to work, the asset must be protected and held. Otherwise, tokens are useless because they represent nothing. Security tokens are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission because they are designed to be used as securities. Bitcoin wallet company Exodus successfully completed a Securities and Exchange Commission-certified Reg A+ token offering in 2021, converting $75 million worth of common stock into Algorand blockchain tokens. This was a historic event because it was the first digital asset security to offer shares of an issuer from the United States. Utility tokens are used to provide services online. For example, they can be used to buy services, pay network fees or redeem rewards. Filecoin, which is used to buy online storage space and protect information, is an example of a utility token. Ether (ETH) is also a service token. It is intended for use in the Ethereum blockchain and virtual machine to pay for transactions. The USTerra stablecoin uses service tokens to try to maintain its peg to the dollar, which it lost on May 11, 2022, by minting and burning two service tokens to create downward or upward pressure on its price. Utility tokens can be purchased on exchanges and stored, but they are meant to be used on the blockchain network to make it work. As their name suggests, meme coins are inspired by a joke or silly look at other famous cryptocurrencies. They tend to gain popularity over a short period of time, often promoted online by famous influencers or investors trying to exploit short-term profits. Many are calling the surge in altcoins of this type in April and May 2021 a “meme coin season,” with hundreds of these cryptocurrencies showing huge percentage gains based on pure speculation. Governance tokens allow holders of certain rights on the blockchain, such as voting for protocol changes or participating in Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) decisions. Because they tend to be native to the private blockchain and are used for blockchain purposes, they are service tokens, but they are commonly treated as a separate type because of their purpose. Discussions about the future of altcoins and cryptocurrencies have precedent in the circumstances that led to the federal issuance of the dollar in the 19th century. Various forms of local currency circulated in the United States. Each had unique characteristics and was backed by another instrument. Local banks also issued currency, in some cases backed by fictitious reserves. This variety of currencies and financial instruments is consistent with the current situation in altcoin markets. Today there are thousands of altcoins available in the markets, each claiming to serve a different purpose and market. The current state of affairs in the altcoin markets can hardly be consolidated into a single cryptocurrency. But it is also likely that most of the thousands of altcoins listed on the cryptocurrency markets will not survive. The altcoin market is likely to coalesce around a group of altcoins – those with high utility, use cases, and a solid blockchain purpose – that will dominate the markets. If you want to diversify the cryptocurrency market, altcoins can be cheaper than bitcoins. However, the cryptocurrency market, regardless of the type of coin, is young and unstable. Cryptocurrency is still finding its role in the global economy, so it is best to approach all cryptocurrencies with caution. The best altcoin to invest in depends on your financial situation, goals, risk tolerance and market circumstances. It’s best to talk to a financial advisor to help you decide which one is best for you. Read more: Top crypto to invest By market cpacity, the top three altcoins are Ethereum, USD Coin, Tether (USDT). Which cryptocurrency is better is a subjective argument based on an investor’s financial circumstances, investment goals, risk tolerance and beliefs. You should talk to a professional financial advisor about investing in cryptocurrency before you buy it.

Share this article Decentralized exchange (DEX) for perpetual trading Zeta Markets has completed a strategic $5 million funding round, led by Electric Capital and with contributions from DACM, Selini Capital, Airtree Ventures, and several notable angel investors, including Anatoly Yakovenko of Solana. The fresh capital will facilitate the development of Solana’s first layer-2 solution by Zeta Markets, focused on decentralized finance (DeFi). The layer-2 rollup will integrate central limit orderbooks and enable seamless bridging from Solana, leveraging the expanding DeFi liquidity pool. Therefore, the goal is to match the efficiency of centralized exchanges while preserving the security and self-custodial features inherent to decentralized platforms. “We are incredibly grateful for the support of Electric Capital and our new investors who doubled down on our vision despite the uncertainty of the bear market,” stated Tristan Frizza, founder of Zeta Markets. “At Zeta Markets, our aim is to craft the ultimate one-stop trading platform, where users can benefit from the transparency of DeFi without having to sacrifice convenience and speed. This fundraise helps accelerate our current momentum and deliver an order of magnitude improvement via a ground-up redesign of our DEX.” This investment increases Zeta Markets’ total funding to $13.5 million. Moreover, Zeta Markets recently crossed $6 billion in aggregated trading volume and over 100,000 monthly active users. “We are thrilled to see the Zeta Markets team deepen their commitment to Solana with the unveiling of their ambitious L2 roadmap. We have seen firsthand their perseverance through the bear market and their commitment to the Solana ecosystem,” said Avichal Garg, co-founder and general partner of Electric Capital. “The Zeta team’s focus on building high-quality, decentralized solutions that solve real problems for users has resulted in tremendous momentum this year. After launching, they have been 50% of the perp volume on Solana for many days. We are proud to continue to support them as they broaden their vision beyond their successful DEX.” Share this article The information on or accessed through this website is obtained from independent sources we believe to be accurate and reliable, but Decentral Media, Inc. makes no representation or warranty as to the timeliness, completeness, or accuracy of any information on or accessed through this website.

563::https://theconversation.com/after-gamestop-the-rise-of-dogecoin-shows-us-how-memes-can-move-markets-154470::The Conversation::article::After GameStop, the rise of Dogecoin shows us how memes can move markets::Despite having no real basis as a financial asset, cryptocurrency Dogecoin recently reached a market cap of more than A$12 billion.::One of the most difficult problems in finance right now is figuring out the fundamental economic value of cryptocurrencies. And the past week has complicated this further. For many cryptocurrency investors, the value of Bitcoin is based on the fact it is artificially scarce. A hard cap on “minting” new coins means there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin in existence. And unlike national currencies such as the Australian dollar, the rate of release for new Bitcoin is slowing down over time. Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency that takes its name and logo from a Shiba Inu meme that was popular several years ago, doesn’t have a cap. Launched in 2013, there are now 100 billion Dogecoin in existence, with as many as five billion new coins minted each year. But how can a currency with a seemingly unlimited supply have any value at all? And why did Dogecoin’s price suddenly surge more than 800% in 24 hours on January 29? At the time of publication, the “memecoin” was worth about A$5.6 billion on the stockmarket. Dogecoin is one of the original “altcoins”: cryptocurrencies released in the few years after the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto first released Bitcoin into the wild. From a technical perspective, Dogecoin isn’t very innovative. Like many early altcoins, it’s based on the original source code of Bitcoin. Or more technically, it’s based on Litecoin, which in turn was based on Bitcoin — but with some small modifications such as faster transactions and the removal of the supply cap. But Dogecoin is much more interesting when seen through a cultural lens. Read more: Why is Bitcoin's price at an all-time high? And how is its value determined? The cryptocurrency was created by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer — although Palmer, an Australian, has since walked away from the project. They branded it with the Doge meme partly to be funny, but also to distance it from Bitcoin’s then questionable reputation as a currency for illicit transactions. Now, Dogecoin has outlasted almost all the early derivative altcoins and has a thriving community of investors. In 2014, Dogecoin holders sponsored the Jamaican Bobsled Team. Soon after, they sponsored a NASCAR driver. Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, is among the cryptocurrency’s high-profile advocates. In December last year, a tweet from Musk sent Dogecoin’s price soaring.  Reddit threads proclaim Dogecoin’s value as a new global currency. Musk himself shared a similar sentiment a few days ago. Speaking on the app Clubhouse, he said: But Dogecoin is best thought of as a cultural product, rather than a financial asset. The reality is few cryptocurrency users hold it as a serious investment or to use in regular transactions. Instead, to own Dogecoin is to participate in a culture. People buy it because it’s fun to have, is inherently amusing and comes with a welcoming and enjoyable community experience. If we start thinking of the cryptocurrency as a cultural product, last week’s sudden jump in Dogecoin’s price makes sense. The boost came just after a meme-centric community managed to drive the share price of videogame retailer GameStop from US$20 to US$350 in mere days. This swarm behaviour was unlike anything seen before — and it frightened global financial markets. One particularly interesting aspect of the Reddit forum r/WallStreetBets — which coordinated the attack on the hedge fund that had effectively bet on GameStop’s share price falling — was how many users were having fun. It’s no surprise activity surrounding Dogecoin has a similar vibe; it was designed to be fun right from the start. Some people participate in financial markets as a form of consumption — meaning for entertainment, leisure and to experience community — just as much as they do for investment. Cultural assets such as Dogecoin are hard to systematically value when compared to financial assets, a bit like how we don’t have a fundamental theorem for pricing art. Almost by definition, the demand for a memecoin will fluctuate as wildly as internet culture itself does, turning cultural bubbles into financial bubbles. RMIT professor and crypto-ethnographer Ellie Rennie calls these “playful infrastructures”. By inspecting Dogecoin closely, we can learn a lot about the interplay of technology, culture and economics. Moreover, cryptocurrencies are extraordinarily diverse. Some are built for small payments or to be resilient holders of value. Others protect financial privacy or act as an internal token to manage smart contracts, supply chains or electricity networks. Under the hood, Bitcoin and Dogecoin look almost exactly the same. Their code differs in only a few parameters. But their economic functions are almost entirely opposite. Bitcoin is a kind of “digital gold” adopted as a secure hedge against political and economic uncertainty. Dogecoin, on the other hand, is a meme people add to their digital wallet because they think it’s funny. But in an open digital economy, memes move markets. ::2021-02-03T02:35:34Z::Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, Doge, Dogecoin, GameStop, Meme, Memes, Shares, Trading::Chris Berg::Home::https://images.theconversation.com/files/382115/original/file-20210203-21-119vb8y.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=49%2C917%2C5520%2C2760&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
564::https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/04/29/stablecoin-legislation-must-respect-the-dual-banking-system/::CoinDesk::article::Stablecoin Legislation Must Respect the Dual-Banking System::The Lummis-Gillibrand stablecoin bill subordinates state regulation to federal control, giving Washington too much power as to which entities can issue these important digital assets, say Jack Solowey and Jennifer J. Schulp at the Cato Institute.::Long before Bitcoin, Ethereum, or DAOs, the U.S. banking industry had its own form of decentralized governance: the dual-banking system. Under this system, banks can be chartered and, with some important caveats, supervised at either the state or the federal level. When U.S. Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) introduced their stablecoin regulation bill on April 17, the legislators emphasized that the bill seeks to “preserve our dual banking system.” But while the senators deserve credit for pursuing this goal, the Lummis-Gillibrand stablecoin bill falls short by subordinating state regulation to federal control. Jack Solowey is a Policy Analyst at the Cato Institute’s Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives. Jennifer J. Schulp is the Director of Financial Regulation Studies at the CMFA. To support the healthy competition among both financial institutions and regulators that the dual-banking system represents, stablecoin legislation must provide a bona fide state pathway free from arbitrary limits and federal gatekeeping. To be sure, the dual-banking system itself at present is far from federalism perfected, and state and federal jurisdiction over banks does overlap in important ways; state-chartered banks that are members of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and/or the Federal Reserve System, for example, face additional federal supervision. But such federal bank supervision makes even less sense for stablecoin issuers, which ultimately provide a payment tool (tokens designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the U.S. dollar), not banking services. While the Lummis-Gillibrand stablecoin bill technically allows for state-chartered stablecoin issuers, it weighs them down with too many restrictions. The most obvious one is a cap on non-depository state trust companies (non-bank entities) that issue stablecoins, limiting them to $10 billion worth of stablecoins outstanding. State-chartered issuers that wish to be free of these caps would be required to register both as state or federal depository institutions (e.g., banks or credit unions) and national stablecoin issuers. National stablecoin issuers, in turn, need a majority vote of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors (Fed Board) to operate. But remaining state-chartered also wouldn’t exempt issuers from federal licensing and oversight. State-chartered stablecoin issuers would face application requirements issued by the Fed Board and incorporating vague standards regarding the stablecoin’s “benefit to the public” and role in the “stability of the financial system of the United States.” While a federal floor for basic stablecoin operating requirements — e.g., disclosure and reserve obligations — is one thing, federal approval standards for otherwise state-chartered issuers are quite another, particularly where they involve nebulous concepts that give regulators broad discretion and create room for abuse. And, notably, the Fed Board would have the power to block these trust companies from issuing stablecoins with a two-thirds vote. The result is that the Fed would have the power to decide which banks are allowed to issue stablecoins, as well as to exclude non-bank issuers from competing with those banks. Such proposed limitations on state-chartered stablecoin issuers subject them to second-class treatment. For instance, while the bill’s $10 billion ceiling on a state trust’s outstanding stablecoins may sound like a wide enough berth, given the importance of user network size and token liquidity to a successful stablecoin such a cap would place state trust issuers at an inherent disadvantage. Further, giving the Fed Board final veto power over what is, in essence, a license to operate a stablecoin business is fundamentally at odds with the role of state charters in the dual-banking system. In the words of banking law scholar Arthur E. Wilmarth, Jr., the dual-banking system generally provides “a ‘safety valve,’” for the payment system “to escape from arbitrary, inflexible or outdated regulation.” This safety valve involves both horizontal (state v. state) and vertical (state v. federal) competition among regulators. Diverse jurisdictions can play the roles of laboratories of innovation, improving frameworks to support new technologies and consumer benefits, vying to attract new businesses, and even residents. Competition among regulators can also translate into more choices for consumers. For example, innovations arising out of the state banking system have included interstate electronic funds transfer via ATMs. Importantly, competition is a two-way street, and Wilmarth notes that federal developments have, in certain instances, helped to liberalize state banking laws. It is particularly important for the stablecoin ecosystem to be free from a single regulatory gatekeeper. For one, federal lethargy in providing pathways for stablecoin issuers, as well as crypto-facing businesses more broadly, have led states — like New York and Wyoming — to pick up the slack. Such states would be relegated to a diminished role under the bill. Avoiding a federal veto over stablecoin licensing is all the more important because the Federal Reserve is conflicted as a provider of payment tools itself. Giving the Fed Board ultimate authority to block its potential competitors unfairly stacks the deck against payment alternatives. Efforts like the Lummis-Gillibrand stablecoin bill to break the logjam on crypto policy at the federal level are welcome. Nonetheless, for stablecoins to achieve their full potential when it comes to consumer choice in payments, stablecoin legislation must let state-chartered issuers compete on fair terms. Now is not the time to whittle away at the benefits of the dual-banking system’s form of decentralized regulation. Edited by Benjamin Schiller.

566::https://blockworks.co/news/argentina-resisting-inflation-bitcoin-demand::Blockworks::article::Q&amp;A: Lemon CFO sees spike in Argentina bitcoin demand as locals flee inflation::Lemon, the Argentinian crypto exchange, just saw its highest week of BTC purchases since 2022, according to company data shared with Blockworks.::Blockworks spoke with Maxi Raimondi, chief financial officer at one of Argentina’s leading crypto exchanges President of Argentina Javier Milei | lev radin/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks Javier Milei, the newly-elected president of Argentina, is imposing shock measures to stabilize the Argentine peso, which saw a 211% inflation rate in 2023. In response, some Argentinians are turning to bitcoin to shield their savings from these economic pressures. The Argentinian crypto exchange Lemon just saw its highest week of bitcoin purchases since 2022, according to data the company shared with Blockworks. This comes soon after bitcoin surged to an all-time high in price. Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading for roughly $70,000, more than double or triple what it was trading for in the doldrums of 2023. Lemon has been a go-to for many crypto-curious in Argentina, where Coinbase isn’t available, and where Binance only began operations recently. Blockworks spoke with Maxi Raimondi, Lemon’s chief financial officer, about his perception on Argentina’s flight to bitcoin. Keep reading for excerpts from Blockworks’ interview. Blockworks: Have you noticed that more of your clients are interested in getting exposure to bitcoin rather than to just the US dollar via stablecoins? Read more: Stablecoins are ‘a better product’ than local currencies in emerging economies, Carrica says Raimondi: Yes. Having this inflation rate, people work 30 days and they are collecting their salary on the last day of the month or the first day of the month. During the last period, we had inflation of about 30% per month. So at the very beginning [of the month], a lot of Argentinians are moving to stablecoins in order to take cover from that inflation and devaluation and to secure their own savings. But we saw in the last month that a lot of people are also moving into bitcoin. The reason may be because of the bull market, maybe because of a lot of news about the halving, maybe because of what’s going on in the US with the ETF. We had an all-time high during February of about 40,000 weekly transactions of people willing to acquire bitcoins. [Editor’s note: Lemon later shared internal data confirming this figure, and showed that stablecoins now account for just 67% of Lemon’s volume, down from 86% in October.] Blockworks: Has it been a challenge being a fiat off-ramp in Argentina, where the currency is devaluing so quickly that if I pay you in pesos for some amount of crypto, the pesos could be worth some percentage less a month later? Raimondi: It is quite a challenge to be a fintech right now in Argentina, but for us and the people in Argentina, it’s really what we’re used to. You know, I remember in the past when hyperinflation took place in Argentina. I remember my parents collecting their salary and going out to the supermarket the same day. And I remember seeing queues and queues of people buying at the supermarket just to cover from the devaluation. And right now I do not see those kinds of things happen, because the people have access to other kinds of coverage such as what we provide. Read more: Binance opens Argentina fiat on-ramps as inflation hits 100% Blockworks: With all of these new clients purchasing bitcoin, I’m just curious, amid all the inflation, are people just buying their crypto and holding it or are they actually using it through Lemon’s payments rails? Raimondi: If people buy crypto [like] bitcoin, it’s really hard to see them selling their bitcoin. However, if they will buy stablecoins — such as USDC or USDT, or DAI, whatever — they sell those [cryptocurrencies] in order to pay for their bills or [use] the payment service that we do have. Blockworks: If inflation gets brought under control in Argentina with a lot of the shock measures being implemented, do you foresee demand for crypto going down? What’s Lemon’s plan to survive a potential reversal of the strength of the peso? Raimondi: We have been thinking about that a lot. Not just Lemon, but the whole ecosystem may take a hit, but the people are on a daily basis using more and more of this type of fintech, not only because they can operate in Argentina, but also because they can transfer cross-border using the cryptocurrency. People may not have another alternative other than the stablecoin to dollarize them. Read more: Argentina elects pro-Bitcoin president Javier Milei Month after month we see more people getting into the fintech arena, although they know that the economy may unify the exchange rate in the near future. We see an opportunity in becoming a principal fintech instead of struggling against a traditional bank, and we see more people getting into fintech and leaving traditional banks.

567::https://coinatory.com/cryptocurrency-articles/how-to-create-nft-7065/::Coinatory::article::Discover how to create NFT in just 6 easiest steps!::This guide will detail the steps needed to create your first NFT, including how to upload your artwork, choose the right blockchain, and ...::Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have become one of the most popular commodities in cryptocurrency over the past few years, with billions in trading volume and multiple celebrities bringing digital artwork to the forefront of the mainstream media. NFT tokens can be created directly on NFT platforms, allowing one to mine (the process of creating or producing something) and upload one’s artwork to the blockchain. This guide will answer the question, “how to create NFT” and go through all steps, including uploading your artwork, choosing the right blockchain, and where to put it up for sale. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are cryptographic assets on a blockchain with unique identification codes and metadata that distinguish them from one another. NFTs are usually represented by digital works of art such as photographs, animated videos, or music. They can be bought and sold in NFT marketplaces and usually require cryptocurrency for payment. Unlike cryptocurrencies, NFTs cannot be exchanged because each NFT is unique. On the other hand, cryptocurrency is fungible and can be exchanged for an equivalent. This means that the value of each Bitcoin is the same, so they can be exchanged for each other. To make NFT, you can either generate it on an NFT market or a cryptocurrency exchange that allows NFT mining. To create an NFT from scratch, you just need to follow these 6 easiest steps NFTs are typically associated with the digital art. It can be an image, audio recording (such as a song), or even a short video clip (such as an animated GIF). The goal is to create a unique piece of digital art that can be sold, much like painting in an art gallery. NFTs are valuable to creators because they are unique, that is, they cannot be owned by others. It is especially important to ensure that you own the rights to the digital media used, as creating NFTs from media that you do not own may have legal consequences. There are several blockchains in which your NFTs can be stored. This blockchain will store a permanent record of your NFT, so it is important to choose one that meets your requirements. The most popular NFT blockchain is the Ethereum, which stores thousands of NFT collections. This blockchain operates using a consensus proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism, making it much more environmentally friendly than before. Most NFT trading venues support the creation of the Ethereum NFT, although the translation of the NFT on the Ethereum blockchain may result in a high gas fee. Ethereum NFTs are created using the ERC-721 standard, which stores NFT metadata in the Ethereum blockchain. This standard was developed by the same teams as the ERC-20 smart contract, and defines the minimum interface-ownership details, security details, and metadata needed to exchange and distribute game tokens. Solana is the closest competitor to the Ethereum Blockchain. Designed as a faster and cheaper alternative to Ethereum, Solana offers transaction fees of less than $0.01 and a growing list of supported NFT applications. In addition, Solana uses proof-of-history (PoH) and PoS consensus mechanisms and boasts much faster transaction speeds than Ethereum. Flow is another PoS blockchain for NFTs and decentralized gaming applications on which the popular NBA top-shot collection of NFTs has been created. Many other sports franchises have created trading floors on the flow blockchain, making it a popular place to create sports-oriented NFTs. Several other blockchains support NFTs, each with its own community and decentralized applications (dApps) for NFT creators and owners. Once you select a blockchain, you will need a digital wallet that supports the blockchain to store NFTs. To create a wallet, you must download the cryptocurrency wallet app, specify a username and password, and store private keys and a recovery phrase offline for backup. There are several popular wallet apps that support multiple blockchains wallets: An ever-growing list of NFT platforms allows you to create NFT, but the best ones offer a full range of NFT hosting and selling services. Here are a few of the most popular NFT platforms: Once a platform is chosen, creating an NFT becomes straightforward. Here is an example of how to create NFT on OpenSea: Once you click on “Create,” your file will be uploaded to the platform, and it will create NFT. However, at this point, the NFT will not be available for sale, and its metadata can still be modified until the item for sale is listed. Putting your NFT up for sale is easy, and most NFT platforms allow you to do so for free. Once you create NFT and put it to your wallet, you can simply click “sell” button on your the platform, determine the price at which you wish to sell it and specify the duration of the sale. After fulfilling the sales requirements, you can create a listing by signing a few transactions in your digital wallet, which might involve paying transaction fees on your preferred blockchain. The cost of listing an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain can vary significantly based on network fees during the listing period, whereas Solana transactions are generally small, usually costing less than $0.01. Yes. Most platforms that issue non-fungible tokens (NFTs) allow the create NFT and place it for sale for free of charge. However, selling NFTs usually comes with a transaction fee. In addition, some NFT blockchains charge a fee for mining NFTs on their blockchain, charging users a network fee. Ethereum charges a gas fee, which is a base fee per unit of work plus a tip, with the fee varying depending on blockchain and network activity. However, the Polygon blockchain does not charge for single mining, but does charge a nominal fee for batch mining. Yes, as long as they are not subject to fair use laws. Copyright is granted as soon as an image, sound byte, video, document, or other original work is created. The creator is the owner of the copyright. Buying NFT does not transfer ownership of the copyright; that still remains with the creator. However, as of July 2022, there is an ongoing debate in Congress about how copyright protection and the NFT should be interpreted. Once you list your NFT for sale, it will have its own unique link that you can share with others. When someone purchases your NFT, you will be charged a small fee by the platform you used to list it. For example, Binance takes a 1% fee plus other charges, while OpenSea takes a flat 2.5% fee on the sale price. However, when you create NFT, you can add a royalty fee that pays you a percentage of the transaction when your NFT is later sold. Creators can earn up to 10% from each transaction.

Share this article US crypto exchange Coinbase has been grappling with a “system-wide outage” since 12:15 am ET earlier today, rendering its services inaccessible to users attempting to access the platform via desktop or mobile. The exchange has been regularly updating its official status page and social media channels, assuring users that their funds remain secure. In its latest post on X, the exchange says that it has “fully recovered” from the incident. Coinbase is now fully recovered. We appreciate your patience and apologize for the inconvenience. https://t.co/AAzEMPaJGL — Coinbase Support (@CoinbaseSupport) May 14, 2024 Despite this, users are still reporting access issues to Coinbase’ platform, with some requesting X for community notes on the matter. Community notes on X is a user-driven feature where contributors are allowed to provide context, fact-checks, and helpful information under posts, images, or videos with the aim of countering disinformation by allowing users from different perspectives to collaboratively contribute notes. Due to the outage, users attempting to visit the Coinbase website have been met with a “503 Service Temporarily Unavailable” error message, indicating that the servers are either down for maintenance or overloaded. The status page has shown progress through the various stages of addressing the outage, from investigating to identifying the problem and monitoring the effectiveness of the implemented fix. Despite the challenges, Coinbase has maintained transparency about its troubleshooting process and has reiterated that all user funds are safe. By 4:16 AM ET, the status page stated that a fix has been implemented and results after the fix are being monitored. Some 42 minutes later, the page stated that the Coinbase team is still “currently” investigating the issue, implying that the implemented fix did not work out as planned. This is not the first time Coinbase has experienced an outage. On February 28, the exchange, along with several others, suffered temporary outages due to a rapid uptick in crypto trading activity during a Bitcoin (BTC) flash crash that saw the asset price fall nearly 10% before spiking back up. This happened again as Bitcoin reached the $67K level during the first week of March 2024. While outages can be frustrating for users, some in the crypto community view surges in traffic that cause extended periods of downtime as a bullish sign, indicating increased interest and activity in the cryptocurrency market.

Not all of them are taken seriously.::As Bitcoin loses value, it may seem like it’s just as useful as the cryptocurrency invented for a joke - Dogecoin. But there are genuine differences between these cryptocurrencies, and it’s not just because one is “much currency, such volatility”. There are 1,448 cryptocurrencies around the world, by some counts. For every Bitcoin you have a programmable coin like Ethereum, or a coin that acts like a token for specific services, like Augur. Some of these coins earn better reputations because of their usefulness, the people who made them, or the tech itself. They are not all taken seriously by investors, researchers and users. The developers behind these cryptocurrencies are also important as they convince other people to adopt them and write new code for the technology to evolve. This new tech attracts new users into the system. Read more: Coinye West to Nyancoin ... how to build your own cryptocurrency Cryptocurrencies can be divided into several types. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin only provide basic functions such as transferring value from one party to another. The next category are smart contract cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Cardano, NEO, and Waves. These cryptocurrencies can be programmed, and so can become the basis for applications like games and digital markets. The third type are cryptocurrencies designed to preserve your privacy like Monero and Zcash. These claim to be “untraceable” although transaction records are still available. Then there are tokens, which are built with smart contracts to serve many purposes. They are often sold to raise funds to build services, and used as tickets for the services (such as Augur and Power Ledger). The differing technologies in these cryptocurrencies mean that certain coins have more potential than others. IOTA is used for “Internet of Things” devices (such as a smart kettle). But it has a special kind of blockchain (the technology that tracks transactions) and so can achieve much higher speeds of transaction and quicker confirmation of trades than Bitcoin. Others like Nxt, and Ardor have built-in features that let users to do other things than just sending coins, such as creating marketplaces and even messaging. People use cryptocurrencies like Zcash and Monero to settle transactions with “zero-knowledge”. This means the cryptocurrencies hide the information of the real payers and payees, and even the amount of coins transacted. Monero has largely replaced the use of Bitcoin in exchanges on the dark web. Read more: KodakOne could be the start of a new kind of intellectual property And smart contracts built with cryptocurrencies like Ethereum have countless potential usecases, from property transactions to digital asset management and fundraising. The technology also means that one cryptocurrency might use significantly less electricity than another. The major cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, are slow because of their inability to handle massive amount of data being sent by users. The technology used to secure the data are expensive and inefficient. Bitcoin can only handle a maximum of seven transactions per second; Ethereum can handle 15 transactions per second. Compare this with the VISA payment system, which can process up to 56,000 transactions per second. But new entrants, such as Red Belly from the University of Sydney, might be able to solve this problem, handling up to 660,000 transactions per second. Smart contracts can also run into problems if they contain bugs. When a decentralised organisation built on Ethereum was hacked in 2016, US$50 million in Ether was stolen.

This explains the explosion in cryptocurrencies since the Bitcoin source code was released under an open licence. Anyone can copy, modify, and release a modified version of Bitcoin. By looking at the current trend, we will see more cryptocoins in the near future. But as we can see, “cryptocurrency” is a term that encompasses a wide range of different technologies, communities and uses. It’s all of these factors that inform whether users, investors, developers and researchers take a coin seriously.::2018-01-22T05:28:33Z::Bitcoin, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, DAO, Ethereum, decentralised, smart contracts::Dimaz Wijaya::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/202772/original/file-20180122-110106-b887fx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C828%2C3334%2C1667&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop

Companies like Uber and Airbnb pioneered the operator economy when they started delivering valuable services using crowdsourced infrastructure and labor. In the process, they proved that this relatively decentralized business model could compete with, and even outperform, traditional businesses. Today, the United States is home to more operating platforms than anywhere in the world, with apps for food delivery, haircuts, babysitters, car sharing, and many more. The U.S. operator economy has produced a stable of unicorns and is on track to be valued in the trillions by 2031. In a sense, the operator economy is becoming The Economy. From the standpoint of market efficiency and social fairness, the operator economy is a failed experiment. Operator “ecosystems” are rife with monopolistic platforms, predatory pricing (subsidized by venture funds) and supported by an expanding underclass of economically precarious “gig” workers. Gig workers receive piecemeal wages and no overtime, are denied employee benefits like Social Security and health coverage, and must pay out-of-pocket to cover costs of doing their jobs. They are also subjected to various forms of wage theft or discrimination by opaque algorithms that orchestrate their work. Decentralized Physical Infrastructure, or DePIN, promises operator ecosystems that are both more efficient and more equitable. DePIN describes community-driven protocol networks that coordinate hardware-based services with tokens, and its underlying logic is as old as crypto itself. Bitcoin is the prototypical DePIN network allowing anyone in the world to contribute computing hardware towards securing an open distributed ledger in exchange for token rewards. This basic logic informs all subsequent DePIN networks. Coming to Consensus? Make sure to check out the Gen C Demo Area to get hands-on experience with a selection of DePIN and emerging technology products. Much like DeFi, DePIN’s leading economic benefit is that it dissolves rent-seeking intermediaries and re-distributes their rents to a range of stakeholders. Take Teleport, a DePIN ride hailing app. Teleport coordinates its ride hailing community using its protocol and token incentives, eliminating the need for any corporate, like Uber or Lyft. This returns extractive margins and fees back to drivers and riders in the form of higher wages and lower prices. Another major improvement is that operators earn an economic stake in the network through the token they accumulate in wages and rewards. As the network expands, these tokens expose operators to pre-IPO venture returns, much like the early miners of the Bitcoin network. In contrast, today’s gig workers don’t receive even basic employee benefits. Tokenization separately benefits the network because it incentivizes early adopters and evangelists, helping to bootstrap the next wave of operators and users.

DePIN is permissionless, meaning that it reduces barriers to entry, draws in a broader range of participants, and expands geographic reach, making it ideal for edge cases. DePIN networks are also transparent and provide more protection against discrimination by algorithm. And because code is harder to halt or censor than a central actor, they can be more difficult to disrupt for political or other illegitimate reasons. In this cycle, Web3 operators are emerging in a range of industries, signaling that DePIN is expanding and maturing. They include: Computing operators. Computing operators provide essential processing and communication services. Projects like Aethir Cloud showcase the potential of decentralized cloud rendering networks, allowing developers to build a range of decentralized consumer applications and users to tap into a collective pool of computational power. Similarly, Akash offers a marketplace for cloud services, challenging traditional providers like AWS and GCP with a decentralized alternative. Data operators. Data operators transform raw data into valuable assets. They deploy hardware to collect and process data, creating datasets and APIs for commercial use. Examples like DIMO and Hivemapper illustrate this trend, with operators gathering vehicle data for insurers or capturing street images for real-time street-level mapping. Beyond mere collection, these operators often enhance data before it’s wrapped into marketable products. Storage operators. Storage operators ensure data permanence in the Web3 operator economy. Projects like Arweave and Filecoin are offering decentralized solutions for file storage. They ensure that data is not just saved but also remains accessible for future use. These platforms are crucial as they safeguard information against loss and obsolescence, enabling a reliable digital legacy. Hardware operators. Hardware operators match physical assets with user demand. Take io.net, which connects companies needing AI processing power with a network of GPU providers. Helium operates similarly, linking small cell hardware owners with those requiring 5G connectivity. In the Web3 operator economy, hardware becomes a shared commodity while every participant plays the dual role of consumer and provider. Despite its recent rise and immense potential, DePIN faces material challenges. Most notably, DePIN networks must navigate the complex regulatory landscape of the real world while remaining committed to decentralization. For example, the mapping service Hivemapper is required to juggle a patchwork of governance, data management, and safety regulations, each with its own set of stringent compliance requirements. These hurdles introduce significant friction, which slows progress towards the desired end state of autonomous protocols. Finally, if they are to succeed, DePIN network must find ways to protect vulnerable operators from the token volatility and crashes that can accompany a bootstrapped network economy. Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin recently wrote of the moral imperative to protect vulnerable crypto users from token collapses and scams. But his argument is even stronger when applied to projects that purport to empower economically disenfranchised groups, such as gig workers, artists and users in the developing world. DePIN is a natural place to begin stretching crypto’s social safety net. Assuming that DePIN can solve those challenges, it will revolutionize the operator economy and put crypto’s value, as well as its values, beyond doubt. Edited by Benjamin Schiller.

572::https://blockworks.co/news/lightspeed-newsletter-helium-cell-coverage::Blockworks::article::Lightspeed Newsletter: Helium eyes the big guys::It’s been more than five months since Helium Mobile debuted its nationwide cell plan in an ambitious application of DePIN.::How Helium Mobile’s plan to decentralize cell coverage is catching on Helium Mobile and Adobe modified by Blockworks Howdy! Web3 is helping pay for both my coffee and my cell phone plan. The latter is the subject of today’s newsletter. Who said the millennial lifestyle subsidy was dead? — Jack Kubinec It’s been more than five months since Helium Mobile debuted its nationwide cell plan, one of the most ambitious applications of what crypto folks call DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure) to date. For $20 a month, Nova Labs, the developer behind the Helium Network, began offering US residents unlimited data plans. Helium Network participants run hotspot nodes that emit cellular coverage, and they’re paid in Solana-based MOBILE tokens for operating these miniature cell towers. In places where no Helium data is available, Nova Labs purchases coverage from T-Mobile. The product has gained nearly 90,000 subscribers since its launch, including this newsletter writer. Nova Labs CEO Amir Haleem told me these growth numbers are solid when put in context. “It looked like in all of last year, AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile only added something like 300-400,000 subscribers combined,” Haleem said, adding that Helium Mobile hopes to reach 300,000 subscribers by the end of the year. Publicly available data seems to tell a different story: AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile each reported millions of new subscribers last year. Nova Labs did not immediately return a request for comment on the discrepancy. As a user, I’ll say Helium’s coverage has been as good as any of my past cell carriers. Recently, I enabled discovery mapping, where Helium Mobile pays MOBILE tokens in exchange for location data in order to determine where it needs to create more coverage. On my first day, I earned $0.78-worth of MOBILE — or roughly ½ of a slice of pizza, in New York terms. But there’s a question that’s followed the Helium Network for a while now: Can this make money? Nova Labs added another revenue stream in January when it partnered with the Spanish telecommunications company Telefónica. The company is offloading some of its mobile data in parts of Mexico to the Helium Network. As data usage increases globally, a new network like Helium’s could prove valuable to data providers. Still, the sustainability of the network’s MOBILE token-based incentives are something of an open question. MOBILE’s price leapt more than 2,000% right after Helium Mobile went nationwide in December, according to CoinGecko. Helium Mobile has yet to face a serious stallout in subscriber growth, which could potentially put downward pressure on the token price. Haleem thinks that the inefficiencies in legacy cellular coverage make Helium an “obvious” application for DePIN. “It’s just wildly too expensive to keep deploying infrastructure the way it’s being deployed,” Haleem said. “It’s hundreds of billions or trillions of dollars to deploy towers all the time. It doesn’t make any sense.” — Jack Kubinec The Helium Mobile dashboard from Dune Analytics shows steady growth in newly minted subscriber NFTs, with 89,474 issued since January 2024.  Initially, numbers soared, but enthusiasm flattened somewhat in recent weeks. On May 10, however, a spike occurred with 837 newly minted NFTs. This surge coincides with Helium Improvement Proposal 113, which increased rewards for Wi-Fi hotspots and reduced them for CBRS radios, incentivizing efficient coverage. The spike seemingly underscores the importance of user rewards on growth within the Web3 world. However, sustained long-term interest will likely depend on the quality of services, not just profit incentives. — Jeffrey Albus On May 12, Solana surpassed Ethereum in daily economic value, recording $2.25 million in transaction fees and MEV — compared to Ethereum’s $1.98 million. The community has been abuzz since, with vibrant discussions spreading across social media. In one X thread by Dan Smith of Blockworks Research, users pointed out the milestone’s intriguing timing. Users debated the significance of Ethereum’s L2 solutions, noting that reduced transactions on Ethereum’s L1 could reflect L2s working as intended rather than a decline in utility. This raised questions about whether L2 activity should be included in such metrics. Mert Mumtaz, co-founder and CEO of Helius and co-host of the Lightspeed podcast, highlighted competitive dynamics, noting how other blockchain projects are targeting Solana developers with job offers. He has been vocal about the potential of Solana’s integrated approach and the limitations of Ethereum’s dominance. Valuation disparities between Solana and Ethereum also fueled discussions, with some suggesting that Solana’s lower current valuation indicates significant potential for growth. This broader sentiment reflects a belief that Solana could see increased adoption and value as it continues to showcase its capabilities and attract more developers and users. — Jeffrey Albus A text from Arman Dezfuli-Arjomandi, a board member at the Helium Foundation:  Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

You can’t dismiss the existence of a ghost once you stitch a neon-lit robe for it, can you? But does the robe fit? The word is in the air, outside every window, in almost every country. Somewhere it is accompanied by the word ‘breaks’, somewhere by the adjective ‘confusing’ and at most of the places, by the word ‘unjust’. After all, a word as heavy and as relevant (for every individual and company, mind you) like ‘taxes’ had to have his own coterie of qualifiers. And phobias. The taxman seems to have popped his/her head again as that duck who stares at you all the time. The fear is building up – in a silly but unshakeable way – for players, enthusiasts, advocates and users in the crypto-industry. Someone is always rubbernecking you – eerily and inexplicably. That’s not a great feeling when you are part of a new and radical industry. But are these ducks really out there? Are they that scary? Are they indeed, ducks? Let’s start with the USA and the general idea of taxes. The tax season is soon to start in America (as the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, readies for 2019 tax returns and for a total taxable annual income of around $2.5 trillion – as per the Government Accountability Office’s report), there is another figure that is casting a big shadow here. Lost revenue (at the federal level) from intentional evasion and unintentional errors tots up to $400 billion per year. A quick look at the IRS’s 2018 Comprehensive Taxpayer Attitude Survey tells that 85 per cent of Americans say it is bad to cheat on taxes. But hey, in the 2017 survey, the number was a little up – 88 per cent. Evading taxes is human – a stubborn habit, but also a tendency supported by loopholes and feelings of unfairness. Now if we start cutting off the edges and zoom in on ‘crypto-taxes’, we see that the scenario is towing the same footprints – most people call these taxes vague, some people want to evade them if they can, some people want to pay but without pulling their hair apart, and the arguments over the ‘just-ness’ of these taxes only keep gathering more steam. If we turn our heads towards Poland, crypto traders were seen debating over the PCC tax on crypto-currencies. Citizens in Denmark were first surprised, then offended, when exchanges handed over their personally-identifiable information to local tax authorities. Just a Deja Vu of Coinbase and IRS some years back. Move towards Brazil and we find the tax agency is fiddling with the idea of fining taxpayers who do not disclose crypto-currency transactions. South Korea inched closer to a 20 per cent tax on crypto-transaction income. Japan has been putting crypto in high tax brackets too. That reminds you of the Schedule 1 tax form about ‘virtual currency’ in the USA. Or HMRC (Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs) in the UK (which is also going to use technology now for strident crypto-intelligence). Questions over tax-liabilities of new categories like airdrops and forks, meanwhile, continue to flummox taxpayers and collectors both. IRS is struggling with that clarity, like many others around the globe. Tax liabilities and confusion could severely add to the industry’s already-huge list of struggles in gaining mainstream acceptance and ecosystem breadth. Tax havens then, offer some respite and hope. It is good to have places like Portugal, Belarus, Malta, and Singapore etc. Or small transactions exempted in regimes as strict as the USA. And some categories blanketed with leniency in Germany, France, Belgium, United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Switzerland and some European regions. But the question is for how long? That should nudge us hard to ask a bigger question. What about people who collect taxes? Are they really unfair, slow and confusing on their own account? Don’t they also have their own ducks to put in a row that keeps shuffling every now and then? Tax interpretation, administrative burden, tax investigation, collection and documentation – they cannot be too easy to handle. Can there ever be a win-win where taxpayers and collectors can stop seeing each other as sitting ducks? Has the goose been cooked already? We turn to Anoush Bhasin, Founder, Quagmire Consulting who has garnered a staggering breadth of answers, some enviable clarity and on-fleek advice for crypto-industry denizens and sceptics alike. His sharp observation and interpretation muscles can help to clear a lot of air and doubts. Opening the window now…. Crypto-tax – First of all, do you think it is a paradox of sorts since most countries do not even recognise crypto as a legit currency or money-form? Also, would it dis-incentivise the fluidity of crypto in everyday transactions – and ruin the efforts that the industry is taking in making crypto mainstream? In most countries, the term “currency” is heavily regulated and its assignment/use restricted to safeguard sovereign control. To this extent, most Regulators are leaning towards categorising crypto as commodities or assets. Naturally, any income earned by buying/selling assets would attract taxes and that is the case with crypto too. Bitcoin was invented to address issues pertaining to censorship, centralisation, monopoly and mutability, However, tax evasion was never intended to be a benefit of this disruption. Rather, it would only take us two steps backwards in the struggle to make crypto mainstream as regulators would have another strong argument in favour of banning it. What keynotes should we make from the IRS guidance for 2019 or that of HMRC in the UK, if any? Firstly, regulators showing an open mind-set to understanding and creating a regulatory framework around crypto. Second, crypto’s categorisation as a property or capital asset vis-a-vis a currency. It allows crypto assets the space and time to grow, become mainstream and co-exist with fiat currencies. Is there a tax-smart, but legal, way to earn crypto or trade in crypto? That entirely depends on the country in which one lives. While the activity of earning crypto would be legal in most countries, tax rates and exemptions may differ. Do the tax implications change for various segments of crypto players? Like miners, dabblers, gamers, start-ups, exchanges, airdrop receivers, speculators, serious investors etc.? Yes, usually different rates of taxes are applicable to different types of income. Broadly, a player can be categorised either as an investor or trader/business. All types of crypto income will then need to be considered in connection to this fundamental categorisation. What is the scenario of crypto-taxation in India – is crypto under the ambit of property or security? Any income earned through crypto-assets is legal and taxable. For the purpose of tax law, crypto-assets can be categorised either as capital assets (for investors) or stock-in-trade (for traders). Any suggestions that Indian tax authorities can look into to extract better and simpler tax compliance here? What tricky areas or complications do you encounter in this space? Multiple assets, multiple exchanges, multiple time-zones and multiple formats make calculations extremely complicated. For enabling easier tax compliance, it would be ideal if the Tax Authority can provide: a) DIY guidance on how to compute income from crypto activities; and b) A separate section with a friendly format in all Tax Returns to disclose crypto income Should the regular non-crypto industry also get ready for taxation awareness of blockchain assets and other virtual assets that may get strong in the near future? Anybody entering the crypto space should first educate themselves on regulatory and tax aspects. As this asset class grows in size, we are surely going to see the topic of crypto taxation gain more traction. Does the decentralised and anonymous nature of data pose a challenge to crypto-taxation or audits? Is Monero easier for tax evasion? Decentralisation and anonymity cause problems in case of on-chain transactions. Although, income can still be tracked if and when crypto is liquidated to fiat, it is hard to identify and tax on-chain transactions (even harder in case of Monero or Zcash). Tracking becomes much easier when trades are executed on Exchanges since most of them keep detailed records of KYC as well as user trade activity. What should industry players – that have entered in this domain- be cognizant of? The IRS vs. Coinbase case or the PCC controversy in Poland – what impact have they left on the industry? Governments will always try and maintain oversight in this space, especially because it allows for a certain degree of anonymity and cross-border capital flows. Rather than playing a game of cat and mouse, a hand-in-hand approach will be significantly beneficial. Tax evasion would only take us two steps backward in the struggle to make crypto mainstream as regulators would have another strong argument in favor of banning it. Any recommendation on how should crypto arising from forks be treated? Simply put, income from forks can be considered investment income (zero cost) for investors and business income for traders. Do regulators have adequate mechanisms to deal with tax-loss harvesting (crypto-trading losses)? Most tax laws allow for setting off or carrying forward losses from a source of income, provided that they have been accurately computed and adequately disclosed. Any take on the emergence of DIY tools for tax calculation and data conciliation like the ones from Lukka or Thomas Reuters? A number of crypto-tax software are now available in the market. It makes life easier as one can either upload trade reports to their platform or allow their read-only APIs to obtain the data directly from the exchange. My personal favourite is Bear. Tax, as they also support computations as per Indian tax laws. Last but not least – why the name Quagmire? Quagmire means a tricky or sticky situation.

Do mainland Chinese investors get access to Hong Kong-listed crypto ETFs?::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Hong Kong’s spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded massive outflows in the latest trading session, according to data from Farside. On Monday, three Bitcoin funds—Borsera, AMC, and Harvest—experienced outflows totaling $32.7 million, marking the largest since their launch. Currently, these funds have approximately $247 million in Bitcoin under management (AUM). Ethereum ETFs also reported outflows, with $6.6 million leaving the funds. These Ethereum funds now have a total AUM of nearly $45 million. Overall, the combined outflows for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong have reached $20.9 million. Discussions are ongoing about the possibility of mainland Chinese investors gaining access to the newly launched Hong Kong’s crypto ETFs. According to a recent report from South China Morning Post (SCMP), these new crypto ETFs are “technically” accessible to mainland Chinese investors. In other words, mainland Chinese investors with Hong Kong bank accounts could potentially purchase shares as long as they pass KYC (know-your-customer) requirements. However, the report also noted that stringent KYC procedures could pose a challenge, as not all brokerages accept mainland ID cards. Plus, despite potential access to Hong Kong ETFs, Beijing’s ban on commercial crypto trading within mainland China remains in effect. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas previously pointed out this existing trading ban as one of the major challenges.

575::https://theconversation.com/could-the-blockchain-be-the-salvation-of-the-pharmaceutical-industry-88429::The Conversation::article::Could the blockchain be the salvation of the pharmaceutical industry?::How a technology born from finance – the blockchain – can help the pharmaceutical industry to carry out clinical trials that protect patients.::Currently 53% of the population doesn’t trust the pharmaceutical industry. Most of this mistrust is caused by the numerous scandals that have hit the industry in recent years, often related to controversial clinical-trial practices, data misuse or hidden secondary effects for commercialised drugs. Overall, patients have complained about the increasing lack of transparency of the pharmaceutical industry when it comes to the conditions in which drugs are developed and tested and this attitude is threatening the future of medical research. A study conducted by Ioannidis et al. reported that 80% of trials described in publications were non-reproducible. In 2008, another study revealed that a considerable number of clinical trials were still unpublished up to five years after FDA approval. Moreover, researchers found discrepancies between the information sent to the FDA and data published and analysed in publications, the latter appearing to be more favourable to the sponsor, incomplete or biased. To combat this, in April 2015 the World Health Organisation (WHO) published a statement requiring the public disclosure of clinical trials and re-affirming the basic measures in order to insure the veracity of the results. Moreover, the FDA requires all clinical trials to be registered on the public website clinicaltrials.gov. Despite this measure, only half of the clinical trials run worldwide are published. The graphs below show the number of studies that have been submitted to clinicaltrials.gov alone versus the number of studies submitted with posted results over time. In 2016, out of the 235,066 studies registered, only 25,899 came with corresponding results which corresponds to approximately 11%. This inevitably leads to considering the reasons why the other 89% of the results were not published on the platform. Greater access to medical and pharmaceutical online information is considerably changing the patient’s relationship with the industry. For instance, patients evolve from being simple spectators of their health to being true actors. Indeed, not only do they search their condition and symptoms online, but they also start investigating and questioning the treatments they are prescribed. Patients are now more than ever aware of the latest news in the pharmaceutical industry and, of course, of the latest scandals. Due to the growing number of communication channels, these scandals take a considerable magnitude. However, the issue is not that information circulates among the population; the issue is that said information is often altered or misinterpreted. Therefore, pharmaceuticals labs are often accused, based on poor evidence, of focusing only on profit and not on the patient’s well-being. However when considering the growing amount of problems in the healthcare system, one can wonder if they should really be the only ones held accountable for all of the scandals related to pharmaceutical products or if the error does not sometimes come from elsewhere. Although this creates substantial trust issues between healthcare stakeholders and patients, there are ways in which clinical trials processes can be improved especially using new technologies. One of the most promising tools of the past decade is without a doubt “distributed ledger technologies” such as the blockchain. The blockchain is a decentralized data management system famous for being the underlying technology of the crypto-currency bitcoin. For the past years, there has been a growing hype around this technology mainly due to its central attributes such as security, transparency and traceability. While 80% of the papers covering blockchain link it essentially to Bitcoin only 20% explore other aspects of the technology. Therefore, there is a great need to further explore this promising technology in the healthcare sector. Imagine the blockchain like a big secure notebook that stores a list of encrypted information. The notebook is immutable, meaning that the information it contains cannot be changed or deleted. This notebook is also transparent which means that anyone can make sure that the information has been written by the right person and was correctly registered. However, what makes blockchain different from other technologies, is that it is decentralised. Indeed, the notebook, or ledger, is not stored in one but in multiple computers in a network. In order to add data to the ledger, all the computers have to agree on the information. As there is no central entity controlling the ledger, there is no way an organisation can decide by itself what to write on the blockchain. When applied to the pharmaceutical industry, and more specifically to clinical trials, the interest of blockchain technology seems obvious. If companies use this tool they will have to come to a consensus with all the stakeholders in the network before being able to register an information on the blockchain, the stakeholders therefore becoming midpoints taking part in the trial or regulatory organisations supervising the process. The advantage of such organisation is that the more people defending different interests there are in the network, the more chances there are to only register authentic and reliable data on the blockchain. Various papers explore the use of this technology in clinical trials. Benchoufi et al. studied ways in which blockchain technology can be used to insure authenticity and traceability of patient consent. The study shows that the proof of existence of each consent form can be timestamped and stored in blockchains, enabling clinical research stakeholder to share consent and re-consent in real-time. Patients are notified each time there is a change in the protocol that requires them to renew their consent, allowing them to be informed of the evolution on the trial. The paper also explores the fact that obtaining consent must be a “lock” before taking the trial further. The conditions for a trial to continue can be coded into the blockchain under the format “IF (condition) THEN (consequence)”. This system, called a “smart contract”, automatically triggers an event when the coded clauses are hit. In the case of a consent form, the smart contract could say: “IF patient consent is registered along with the patient’s unique digital signature THEN the patient can be included in the trial”. Consent is not the only point of failure in a clinical trial. As such, Nugent et al. also explored the use of blockchain to reduce data fraud. The paper suggests a private, permissioned blockchain maintained by regulators, pharmaceutical companies and research organisations. Each document produced during the trial can be recorded on this blockchain such as the protocol or patient biological tests results. Moreover, when data privacy is required, information can be encrypted making sure that identifiable data regarding the patient cannot be unveiled. The figure below represents the flow of information that circulate in a clinical trial and the possible interactions with blockchains. Although the technology is relatively young, it is rapidly becoming an important element in the healthcare industry as it allows to store and share information among a group of stakeholders that don’t trust each other. The main concern regarding the adoption of the technology is that fact that blockchain only has as an interest when talking about transactions at an ecosystem level. Therefore, convincing and implementing new systems in a hospital or a pharmaceutical company only is not enough. Efforts should therefore go into building consortiums of the entire industry to leverage this new disrupting technology.::2018-01-11T20:45:13Z::Big Pharma, Blockchain, Clinical trials, Digital healthcare, Pharmaceuticals, The Conversation France, smart contracts::Anca Petre::En anglais::https://images.theconversation.com/files/197151/original/file-20171130-30907-7qalp8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
576::https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/04/26/consensys-a-target-for-the-secs-assault-on-eth-is-fighting-back/::CoinDesk::article::Consensys, a Target for the SEC’s Assault on ETH, Is Fighting Back::The Ethereum development company is seeking regulatory clarity on a number of questions, in a case that some experts see as potentially heading to the Supreme Court. About face ‘Remarkable acceleration’::Consensys, one of the main supporters of the Ethereum network, claims the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is attempting a power grab over Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest blockchain by market capitalization. And so, as natural, the Ethereum development company is suing, citing regulatory overreach. This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here. “The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission seeks to regulate ETH as a security, even though ETH bears none of the attributes of a security – and even though the SEC has previously told the world that ETH is not a security, and not within the SEC’s statutory jurisdiction,” according to the lawsuit filed in a Texas court on Thursday. Over-and-above Consensys’ lawsuit is the growing trend of U.S. crypto companies and organizations willing to fight back against what they see as overzealous regulation. There are many unsettled questions regarding crypto law, and going on the offensive – possibly even bringing a case before the Supreme Court – would be one way to get answers. See also: Consensys Sues SEC Over ‘Unlawful Seizure Of Authority’ Over Ethereum Coinbase, for instance, is spending big to challenge a case brought by the SEC, and itself went to the courts to sue the agency seeking to get clarity on key questions of crypto law. Kraken and Uniswap, also facing SEC suits, vowed to fight back – and LBRY, now defunct, literally fought until the end. Then there are the lobbyist organizations like the Blockchain Association, which this week sued the SEC over a narrow point of law, the definition of a “broker” that, if the agency had its way, would have broad impact over the crypto industry. In 2022, Coin Center sued the U.S. Treasury Department (and lost) for sanctioning crypto mixer Tornado Cash. “Consensys is joining some of the leading companies in the space in a broad industry pushback against regulation by enforcement that is destructive to the future of the internet. This is the responsibility of every Web3 company that has the capital and expertise to navigate the U.S. power structures,” Lex Sokolin, founder of Generative Ventures and a former Consensys employee, told CoinDesk in an interview. "It's invigorating to witness top actors in our field engaging with regulators to seek clarity in our exponentially growing industry,” CEO of the dYdX Foundation and former Consensys lawyer Charles d'Haussy told CoinDesk. A key argument of Consensys’ suit is that the SEC had already declared that ETH is not a security, all the way back in 2018 when then SEC Director William Hinman gave a speech stating as much. It confirmed this position in 2021, when the first ETH futures launched in the U.S., putting the asset under the purview of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). There’s an argument to be made that the SEC had a fresh start to reevaluate Ethereum after it dropped mining for proof-of-stake. However, some experts note the SEC approved additional futures products after that happened, again dampening the argument that ETH is a security. When news first dropped that the SEC was possibly investigating the non-profit Ethereum Foundation and subpoenaing firms for information related to Ethereum’s development, many experts interviewed by CoinDesk agreed that it would be illegal to reverse course after so much time. An entire multi-billion dollar industry has already been built on the understanding that ETH is a commodity. It’s “the whole ‘you can't just arbitrarily change your mind and damage people for hundreds of billions of dollars after a decade’ and also by the way the CFTC will likely fight back” argument, Austin Campbell, a Columbia Business School assistant professor and former adviser to stablecoin issuer Paxos, told CoinDesk in an interview at the time. See also: Why the SEC Shouldn't Classify ETH as a Security "The case we have filed today is intended to preserve access for the thousands of developers, market participants, and institutions who have a stake in the world's second largest blockchain," Joe Lubin, Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO, said in a statement. "The SEC cannot be allowed to arbitrarily expand its jurisdiction.” According to the complaint, Consensys is looking to clarify three particular points: first, that ETH is a commodity; second, that the most popular Ethereum wallet, developed by Consensys, is not a broker; and lastly to get an injunction to leave developers alone and preemptively prevent the SEC from suing the company. In addition to receiving multiple subpoenas in 2023 and in recent weeks, Consensys’ court filing also disclosed that the company received a Wells Notice on April 10, or an indication that the SEC is working to build a case. According to Consensys Senior Counsel and Director of Global Regulatory Bill Hughes the company complied with the “voluntary” requests for information. Notably, the SEC asked for information not only about Consensys itself – including questions about its ETH holdings and treasury sales, and whether it contributed to the Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP) that led to Ethereum’s switch to proof-of-stake – but also questions about open source developers. “The fact that they're looking at open source protocol developers, certainly with an eye on building a case to enforce, really struck us as way out of bounds,” Hughes said, adding that Consensys was asked to provide lists of coders and their GitHub repositories. “To some degree, they are redefining their regulatory purview and becoming an internet regulator. “This is not something we necessarily enjoy doing or want to do. But to a large extent it's necessary to defend the use of and building upon Ethereum and really all programmable blockchains in the United States,” he added. While standing up for open source development may be motivating factor, Hughes suggested that the company was forced to move by what they saw as a “remarkable acceleration in their aggressiveness with respect to Ethereum” and their interactions with the agency that “made it clear that they viewed [Consensys] as the target for an Ethereum enforcement action.” “Should they be left unopposed they could do meaningful harm to our company in particular and the broader ecosystem. It comes to a point where you just can't wait any longer,” he said. In particular, the SEC appears to be building a case that MetaMask Swaps, a decentralized exchange aggregator for swapping tokens that charges a 0.875% transaction fee, and MetaMask Staking, a relatively recent product essentially limited to users with 32 ETH to spare to become an Ethereum validator that takes a 10% cut of staking rewards, are in violation of securities or brokerage laws. (Several state regulators have also challenged the legal ground of staking.) “The end goal of the suit is to get the judge to agree and issue an order finding that Ethereum is a commodity, that the SEC has been acting beyond its statutory authority and in violation of procedures it's required to comply with, and that peer to peer software that people use to read and transact with themselves on the blockchain is not a broker,” Hughes said. But other experts CoinDesk spoke to say the case may have an even loftier vision. “This Consensys lawsuit is a really big deal. They’re positioning themselves to challenge the SEC’s authority to regulate crypto,” University of Kentucky law professor Brian Frye said in an interview, noting the case was filed it in the 5th Circuit — which is “notoriously anti-government and anti-regulatory.” See also: ‘It Can Be Said With Confidence the SEC Is Investigating Ethereum’: Consensys’ Bill Hughes Talks Crypto Law In other words, Consensys may be trying to build a case worthy of taking before the Supreme Court. Frye noted that this particular SCOTUS would likely be willing to “revisit and narrow” the scope of the Howey test, one of the ways the SEC determines whether something is a security, and the basis for the majority of its litigation against crypto firms. “Consensys hired Wachtell, which is the most expensive law firm in the world. That means they are really, really serious,” Frye said. It’s worth noting that Consensys recently relocated to Texas (its new listed address is a WeWork) from New York, which would make establishing jurisdiction in the 5th Circuit easier. “If that happens, there’s just no way SCOTUS doesn’t take the case,” Frye added. For his part, Hughes denied the claim, saying that Texas is business-friendly and home to a burgeoning crypto scene. (CoinDesk’s Consensus 2024 conference will be held in Austin in May, for instance.) “By contrast, New York was getting a little chillier,” he said. In any case, Consensys’ legal maneuver certainly changes the dynamic between the firm and would-be regulator. Its lawsuit doesn’t necessarily preclude the SEC from filing its own case, or unilaterally declaring ETH a security (which it has been reluctant to do so far), which would essentially make it illegal to spend ETH in the U.S. But the situation is “meaningfully different” now that Consensys is a plaintiff rather than just a target. At the very least it’s one way to show the world that the SEC’s Enforcement Division, and likely leadership, “considers Ethereum security” without having the gall to state it directly. “We think our action is appropriate because we think that the right answer needs to be gotten to and we're happy to call the question,” Hughes said.

The Department of Justice unsealed charges against Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Peraire-Bueno on Wednesday. The pair are charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering after the brothers allegedly tried to “exploit the very integrity of the Ethereum blockchain to fraudulently obtain approximately $25 million worth of cryptocurrency within approximately 12 seconds.” Both were arrested on Tuesday and will face judges in Massachusetts and New York. The April 2023 exploit targeted bots that seek profit by essentially trying to front-run transactions on the network. Maximum extractable value, or MEV, referring to the maximum value that can be obtained during transaction block production beyond rewards and fees. Read more: Ethereum Validator Goes Rogue, Frontruns MEV Bots for $25M The Peraire-Bueno brothers sought to “lure” MEV bots from the traders they allegedly targeted by “proposing at least eight specific transactions that…the defendants knew would cause the” targeted bots to include the lure transactions in the bundles, the indictment said. The exploit took advantage of a since-patched code vulnerability in the MEV-Boost software. “In each of these eight bundles, the victim traders effectively bought substantial amounts of particularly illiquid cryptocurrencies…for approximately $25 million of various stablecoins.” “Through the Exploit, which is believed to be the very first of its kind, Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Pepaire-Bueno manipulated and tampered with the process and protocols by which transactions are validated and added to the Ethereum blockchain. In doing so, they fraudulently gained access to pending private transactions and used that access to alter certain transactions and obtain their victims’ cryptocurrency,” a DOJ press release said. To avoid detection, the two tried to conceal their identities through shell companies and private crypto addresses. Following the attack, the brothers even “transferred the stolen cryptocurrency through a series of transactions designed to conceal the source and ownership of the stolen funds.” They researched know-your-customer (KYC) procedures online, per the indictment, to learn the KYC standards and extradition procedures. They allegedly also researched the crimes they’d end up being charged with. “As alleged in today’s indictment, the Peraire-Bueno brothers stole $25 million in Ethereum cryptocurrency through a technologically sophisticated, cutting-edge scheme they plotted for months and executed in seconds,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco.

If everyone from SWIFT to Visa to Facebook to IBM to Unbounded to even JP Morgan is going after it in really disruptive ways, are we closer to the sweet and hot smell of a perfect and well-rounded answer now? Facebook has just hit the headlines. Again. This time for consolidating payments across all its platforms with Facebook Pay. That is intriguingly close on the heels of Visa announcing the commercial launch of the Visa B2B Connect network. It wants to bring something that can help financial institutions to quickly and securely process high-value corporate cross-border payments – and globally. This B2B Connect launch is set to sprawl to 30 global trade corridors and expects to touch some 90 markets by the end of 2019. We will talk about (in a bit) the other names (familiar and new) in the race for a good global payment solution for the current age. But this is 2019. Its tail-end to be precise. We are long past the arrival and excitement of blockchain too. The grill must have been heated well now. The kettle has been whistling already. Then why are we still hovering around the stove? Truth is, we have been waiting for so long that it has become a well-worn habit by now. Breakfast or The Last Supper Sending and receiving payments across the globe was always full of friction, long wait-windows, iron-gut patience, bloated margins, intermediary processes (and consequent fees), and lots and lots of dots to hop over before the mellifluous sound of that beep sang somewhere. In fact, all the new alternatives that are now in the batter are trying to fix one or all of these problems. The idea is to make payments fast, fluid, friction-less, party-less, margin-lean and not something that reminds you of the good old postman. Because, in a post-blockchain world, it is hard to not groan and croak when something as simple as a payment still takes longer than the blink of an eye. The days of every bank and party delaying the payment process and extracting a fee could not last long. Patience may be a virtue, but users across the globe are not going to spend it in this area – not when they hail cabs, order meals, pay bills and send home-made pickles at the snap of a finger. Scratch that Itch Thankfully, even SWIFT, or Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, which reigned this empire of global payments for many happy, un-interrupted years, started to realize that the word ‘swift’ was gaining new proportions in the digital age. Users wanted a new definition of adjectives like ‘fast’, ‘transparent’ and ‘frictionless’. Someone had to massage this big emerging need. A lot of ‘someones’ started arriving, including an awakened SWIFT, with its own GPI (Global Payment Initiative). At the last count, 50 per cent of GPI payments were credited to end beneficiaries within 30 minutes, 40 per cent in under five minutes, many in seconds – as claimed by SWIFT. This May, it joined hands with the European Central Bank (ECB) for an initiative to extend the reach of instant cross-border payments deeper into the European market by enabling the SWIFT GPI in the TIPS system. The idea was to get rid of the final-leg delays and friction. Ask Dharmaraj Ramakrishnan, Sr. Director- Banking & Payments, FIS about how this gpi is impacting the speed and security part of international payment landscape, and he lets on that SWIFT, with its GPI initiative, has responded creatively and proficiently to consumers demand and expectations. “With the current pace of technological advancements, consumers expect to access money anytime and anywhere. With the introduction of SWIFT – GPI one can meet the consumer demands of today to a larger extent. The SWIFT – GPI has the well-orchestrated architecture for cross-border payments covering faster delivery, transparency on cost and charges, traceability of payments, security and compliant with regulations. SWIFT – GPI ensures that payments are fast, traceable across the multiple banks in real-time and delivers confirmation when the beneficiary account is credited. It brings in monitoring capability and gets adherence to service level agreement (SLAs) as well as easy identification of counterparties.” SWIFT was not the only one to hear the bugle. There was Ripple. There was IBM. And Moneygram. There was JPMorgan as well, armed with the Interbank Information Network (IIN) that is quickly gaining interesting names like Deutsche Bank and 356 such banks signing up on the platform since its launch in 2017. When it comes to cross-border transactions, players like Mastercard have also partnered with blockchain firms like R3 and biggies like Walmart are jumping on the wagon as fast as they can. Word on the street tells that a strong SWIFT alternative is being baked in China, Russia and India, to connect as many as 3 billion people in the three BRICS emerging economies. Look at Visa’s attempt. The network, as it stated in the announcement, is using a unique digital identity feature and tokenization as it leverages open-source Hyperledger Fabric framework from the Linux Foundation, with IBM. A scalable, permissioned network is being explored for achieving that velocity that has been evasive and elusive so far. Friction is the big nail that these hammers are after. As Kevin Phalen, SVP, global head of Visa Business Solutions explained in the announcement. “By creating a solution that facilitates direct, bank to bank transactions, we are eliminating friction associated with key industry pain points. With Visa B2B Connect, we are making payments quicker and simpler, while enhancing transparency and consistency of data.” Simplicity, transparency and consistency of data – just the very words that remind you of blockchain. A power whose force has not been missed by other hammers too. Especially the digital natives. Platforms like Hyperledger Fabric, Hyperledger Sawtooth, R3 Corda, EEA Quorum and Stellar and unifying answers like Unbounded are making sure that cross-border payments get more than just a micro-wave toss as the hunger-growls for something really spot-on build up. Frankly, it would have been a surprise if fewer names had joined the pool party. The market is just too big a splash to ignore or postpone. Pooh’s Pot of Honey Comb through a McKinsey report on global payments in 2018, and it is hard to miss that an 11 percent growth generated by payments (that topped $1.9 trillion in global revenue) was the largest annual jump measured in the past five years. In a previous year report it was estimated that payments would become a $2 trillion business by 2020. We are talking trillions here. Money that is certainly all tucked in for a new haircut. The word ‘real-time’ is the sharp pair of scissors that this space needed so much. India, incidentally, grabbed the only 5+ rating and came up as the global leader in real-time payments usage as per a recent FIS survey on the ‘Faster Payments Innovation Index.’ Australia, Denmark, Poland, Romania, Singapore and Sweden received a 4+ rating and the U.S. and U.K. got a 4 rating for their faster payments schemes. The FIS research observed that the number of real-time payment systems in use around the world has increased 35 percent over the past year and nearly fourfold since 2014. It attributes this spike to use of chat-based services, retail apps, instant loans and open APIs, as well as the migration toward the ISO 20022 global payments standard. The space of payments is unmistakably asking for bold shifts. And it promises bold paybacks too. In McKinsey’s report, even the slower growth categories like higher-ticket account-based remittances (for affluent consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises) and cross-border disbursements to micro-enterprises (driven by the growing prominence of online marketplaces) were identified as pockets of opportunity. So whipping out a sloppy pancake again, is not a luxury that players and disruptors can afford now. “The SWIFT GPI allows for faster transactions, increased transparency on payments delivery status, and improved fee clarity compared to traditional correspondent payments.” The McKinsey report assessed. But as it pertinently added, ‘while the GPI stands to help banks address many pain points associated with cross-border payments, it still operates within the established correspondent banking frame and requires adjustments of processes and systems, which create hurdles for some players in the industry.” No time for bubbles Complexity, limited infrastructure and lack of transparency on foreign exchange fees haunt the legacy space while what innovators bring continue to bump their heads against walls of scale, scalability and incumbency advantage of existing biggies. Can the old brigade, with their new bank consortiums, fight with the platform fragmentation of different banks that will play out sooner or later? The McKinsey report picked up the integration of open banking/PSD2 with real-time payments and blockchain as answers worth a mention. But can the new breed fight closed-data ecosystems, make some newly-relevant room for bank collaboration, and find something that builds end-to-end transparency and integrity? The time and difficulty needed to integrate blockchain in current business set-ups – they cannot be glossed over too. A report by Ripple ‘Blockchain in Payments’ shows that 35 per cent of respondents are concerned about this problem. Surveying over 1,000 industry leaders in the payments industry, the report found that interest in cross-border payments is increasing. It also showed that 31 percent look at the cross-border payments market as a way to expand services to new market. When there were as many as 75 percent that were ‘extremely interested in digital assets for cross-border payments’ and 87 percent who were considering implementing blockchain technology, then it is about time the solutions being devised iron out the issues that hold the excitement back from spreading its yummy smell beyond the kitchen windows. Because it is okay to experiment and evolve, but not endlessly fiddle with when it comes to something as hot and as staple as global payments. The atlas has shrugged. To the size of a thumb waiting to tap on a button. The payment space will have to embrace this morning and get up on a different side of the bed. One Gordon Ramsay Please! Among other good points of SWIFT gpi that Ramakrishnan points out, what really lingers on is the part about it being ‘Open, inclusive and collaborative with global reach along with a great reduction in operational cost’. That’s fresh. If that change continues, whether with SWIFT or Ripple or IBM or Unbounded or anyone else, the users as well players of the cross-border landscape can finally bring their hungry plates to the table. But for that to happen, a lot (friction, delay, intermediary burden, closed-loops, complexity etc.) that still sticks stubbornly around, will have to be, well, flipped over.

580::https://cryptobriefing.com/crypto-inflows-rebound/::Crypto Briefing::article::Solana leads altcoins funds' interest with $5.9 million in inflows::Grayscale's GBTC registered the smallest weekly outflows since January.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Crypto investment products showed $130 million in inflows last week, with Solana (SOL) leading the institutional investments in altcoins by growing $5.9 million. According to asset managing firm CoinShares, that’s the first weekly inflow for crypto funds in the past five weeks. Bitcoin specifically garnered $144 million in inflows, recovering from what had been a lackluster month. Meanwhile, short Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) experienced outflows of $5.1 million, contributing to an eight-week total of $18 million in outflows. The US regulators’ minimal engagement with ETF issuer applications for a spot Ethereum ETF has fueled speculation that approval may not be forthcoming. This sentiment is reflected in the $14 million in outflows observed last week. In the US, inflows dominated, totaling $135 million, marking the smallest weekly outflows for Grayscale since January at $171 million. Switzerland also saw positive inflows, amounting to $14 million. Conversely, Hong Kong’s inflows slowed to $19 million after a previous week of record highs, indicating that the initial surge post-Bitcoin ETF launches may have been primarily seed capital. Canada and Germany continued to face outflows, totaling $20 million and $15 million respectively, with their combined year-to-date outflows now reaching $660 million. Despite this uptick, ETP volumes have decreased, with the week’s total reaching $8 billion compared to the $17 billion average in April. The current figures suggest a decline in ETP investor participation within the crypto market, now accounting for 22% of the total volume on trusted global exchanges, down from 31% last month.

581::https://theconversation.com/how-blockchain-can-democratize-green-power-87861::The Conversation::article::How blockchain can democratize green power::Blockchain technology could be applied to our energy grids to make them smarter, and turn energy consumers into producers.::Imagine buying a solar panel from a hardware store, mounting it on your roof, then selling the green electricity you produce at a price you set. Is this even possible? Some companies certainly think so. These startups are harnessing the power of blockchains to democratize green power. Before you can understand how blockchains are part of the solution, you first need to know a few things about the green electricity market. Today, independent auditors assess renewable-energy producers and certify their electricity as “green.” These producers can then sell Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) to consumers who want to buy green energy. This is how corporations such as Apple and Google can say they are 100 per cent green. They aren’t generating their own green electricity, but purchasing certificates from green-energy producers. Of course, the actual energy they use is not always green. As long as every unit of energy they consume matches up with a purchased REC, green energy is displacing carbon-intense energy. A market for RECs creates a strong signal for investment in green electricity generation. Some companies do power some or all of their operations using Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). This commits them to purchasing a certain amount of energy at a certain price from renewable-energy producers over time-scales of about 20 years or so. PPAs reduce risk for generators by guaranteeing return on investment, thus creating a strong motivation for long-term investment in green generation. Both of these approaches, however, discriminate against small generators of green electricity. The certification process for RECs is cumbersome and expensive, with physical audits, so it doesn’t make sense for mom-and-pop green generators. Similarly, PPAs can only be negotiated by large green generators. For these two reasons, small-scale green generators must make do with whatever price their local utility pays them. This price can be volatile due to meddling by legislators as well as by the utilities themselves. Thus, small generators are exposed to higher levels of risk than bigger players. What if we could reduce the cost of certification, eliminate onerous auditing and avoid non-market price controls, so that even a small-scale green generator could de-risk investments? This is what companies such as PowerLedger in Australia and LO3 Energy in Brooklyn provide. They use blockchains to store generation certificates that are created by tamper-proof meters attached to solar panels. Read more: Demystifying the blockchain: a basic user guide These blockchains also store transaction records when the certificates are traded, so that the same unit of generation cannot be resold. By eliminating auditors, transaction costs and price regulation, this solution makes renewable-energy investment attractive even for small players. Unfortunately, this approach has a scaling problem. Today’s blockchains cannot support the addition of more than a few hundred certificates or trades (we’ll call them both “transactions”) per second. This is because blockchain servers need to agree on the contents of each block, despite server and communication failure and the presence of malicious servers. This is the well-known and difficult “consensus problem.” Because of this problem, the scale needed to support hundreds of millions of solar panels is beyond the reach of current blockchain technology. For instance, BitCoin, the best-known blockchain, supports only about 10 transactions per second and HyperLedger, IBM’s competing solution, under 1,000 transactions per second. A democratic REC system would generate transactions at a rate hundreds of times faster. My colleagues at the University of Waterloo have recently devised a new solution to the consensus problem called Canopus. Canopus takes a server’s location on the internet cloud into account, minimizing communication between geographically-distant servers. By keeping most communications local and fast, blockchain servers can process far more transaction records each second than a traditional consensus protocol that doesn’t take location into account. This improvement in scaling allows even mom-and-pop green generators to obtain certificates and participate in energy transactions. We are currently building a prototype blockchain using Canopus that we hope will handle more than one million transactions per second. In our solution, smart meters attached to solar panels send RECs to brokers. Consumers can purchase these RECs using their own brokers. If successful, our work will encourage homeowners and small businesses to invest in renewable energy technologies to become green generators. It would also encourage Ontario’s electricity consumers to become 100 per cent green, just like Apple and Google. Indeed, since blockchain knows no boundaries, our system could allow green generators in sun-drenched developing countries to recoup their investment in green generation by selling RECs to consumers around the world. Of course, this requires placing blockchain servers in every region of the world, but this is easily done using existing datacenter infrastructure. This would reduce the global carbon footprint, and would be more efficient — thus less costly — than deploying solar panels in sun-poor northern countries. The development of a scalable, tamperproof and globally accessible energy blockchain would enable other energy transactions. Emissions-free electric vehicles (EVs) allow consumers to use electricity instead of gasoline to meet their transportation needs. While consumers get incentives to purchase EVs, they receive none to operate them. Blockchain makes it possible to reward EV owners for operating their EVs, or providing ancillary services to utilities, making the vehicles more affordable. EV owners could be further rewarded if they charged their cars with green electricity. Although the technology for building scalable blockchains will soon exist, one problem is that some jurisdictions, including Ontario, give local distribution companies tight control on integrating green generation to ensure grid stability. While this is certainly necessary, there is no intrinsic need for green generators to be tied into a provincially mandated pricing plan such as the microFIT scheme. The province should allow generators to sell their electricity to the highest bidder, just like any other producer. We also need to build, deploy and critically evaluate small-scale prototypes of blockchain-based transactive-energy systems so that we can learn by doing. As solar and wind costs continue to drop and energy storage technologies reach maturity, it is becoming possible to turn away from carbon-intense electricity generation and gasoline vehicles. Democratizing the deployment of these technologies using scalable energy blockchains will, we hope, accelerate this important societal transformation.::2018-01-07T21:25:22Z::Blockchain, Electrical grid, Energy, Microgrid, Renewable energy, Solar panels::Srinivasan Keshav::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/201024/original/file-20180105-26154-1my86si.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C708%2C5499%2C2749&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
582::https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/04/25/samourai-wallet-charges-raise-existential-questions-for-privacy-tech/::CoinDesk::article::Samourai Wallet Charges Raise Existential Questions for Privacy Tech::Co-founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill are charged with money laundering related to the privacy-protecting wallet. Op-sec Privacy dragnet? Fighting for privacy::The U.S. government has put to rest any doubts that any involvement in or profiting from privacy tools beyond authoring code for crypto mixers is off limits. Call it an assault on privacy or attack on free speech, but the reality on the ground is that any money that flows into an application designed to mix funds to shield user addresses is being treated as laundered funds, no matter the purpose or destination. Bitcoin Fog. Tornado Cash. Now Samourai Wallet. Samourai Wallet was (its servers have been seized) a bitcoin wallet that promised to "keep your transactions private and your identity masked” through a privacy-preserving service called "Whirlpool." Authorities say the wallet processed over $2 billion in unlawful transactions, including at least $100 million via illegal dark web marketplaces like the Silk Road and Hydra Market. Similar arguments were made about Tornado Cash, when it was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury, which essentially counted every dollar that flowed through it as criminal in nature. “Together with our law enforcement partners, we will continue to relentlessly pursue and dismantle criminal organizations that use cryptocurrency to hide illicit conduct," U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement on Wednesday. See also: Crypto OG Zooko on State of Digital and Financial Privacy There is much to say about Samourai Wallet’s co-founders Keonne Rodriguez, 35, and William Lonergan Hill’s, 65, op-sec (i.e. “operational security), or apparent lack thereof. Rodriguez was arrested in Pennsylvania and will be arraigned this week, while the U.S. is still working to extradite Hill from Portugal. “I don’t know how they thought they wouldn’t get arrested and prosecuted for this. It sounds like the DOJ has direct evidence of them saying they knew they were helping people conceal illegal transactions and charging for the service,” University of Kentucky law professor Brian Frye told CoinDesk in an interview. The DOJ alleges that Rodriguez and Hill actively solicited criminal customers in their marketing and social media posts. Hill, for instance, reportedly said "At Samourai we are entirely focused on the censorship resistance and black/grey circular economy. This implies no foreseeable mass adoption,” in an intercepted internal message. “Ultimately if you’re knowingly facilitating illicit finance and profiting from it, which is alleged in the complaint, the outlook is bleak,” venture capitalist Nic Carter said in a direct message. “Nevertheless it’s disturbing the extent to which the Biden Admin[istration] is attempting to criminalize privacy.” The Biden Administration has seemingly ramped up efforts to knock down mixing services. That includes arresting Russian-Swedish national, and Bitcoin Fog operator, Roman Sterlingov in April 2021 and participating in the arrest of the co-founders of Tornado Cash in 2023. However, crypto mixers have long been in the sights of criminal prosecutors. In Sterlingov’s case, investigators worked to establish evidence over a period of years. See also: How a Bitcoin Mixer Laundering Conviction Might Be Appealed As far back as May 2019, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has been concerned about cryptocurrency “tumblers,” finding that that “persons who accept and transmit value in a way ostensibly designed to protect the privacy of the transmittor [sic] are providers of secure money transmission services and are not eligible for the integral exemption.” In other words, mixers are money transmitters, even though a person is generally only transmitting funds between two addresses they control to anonymize their funds. And if you’re deemed a money transmitter, FinCEN noted, you’re expected to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act. “My opinion is that the crypto industry should treat regulation as 'de force majeure' and adjust to it,” Tal Be’ery, co-founder and chief technology officer of the ZenGo wallet, said. [Force majeure is a common legal clause absolving parties from liability.] “The U.S. government made it very clear that operating a mixer is unacceptable with the prosecution of Tornado Cash operators and therefore going after other mixers could be very much expected.” Others are concerned that it isn’t just mixing services being targeted, but all privacy-preserving blockchain tech. “From the cases against Tornado Cash to the IRS 'broker rule' to the arrest of Samourai Wallet's founders, it's clear that the U.S. government is moving aggressively against privacy tools in crypto,” Galaxy Digital head of research Alex Thorn told CoinDesk. See also: Privacy Isn't Just an Edge Case for Crypto It’s worth noting that, while Rodriguez and Hill remained active in overseeing the protocol since it launched over a decade ago, the Samourai wallet was non-custodial and open-source. The code was "self-hosted” on the company’s open source GitLab repository, although the provided link no longer appears to be working. The Samourai apps have also been removed from the Google and Apple app stores, though theoretically the software can be built, run and hosted by anyone. Some experts contacted by CoinDesk, including Frye, believe that crypto mixers could theoretically be legal to code, but likely not to market or maintain. Releasing software is generally protected by the First Amendment in the United States, because code is a language and language is speech. “While crypto mixers might in theory be legal, if used only for protecting the privacy of legal transactions, using them to conceal illegal transactions is definitely illegal,” Frye said. “It's clear that if developers maintain any involvement in privacy tools beyond authoring code – whether that be operating front-ends, facilitating any kind of money movement or taking fees – they will be targeted. For on-chain privacy to succeed in the future, tools must be completely decentralized,” Thorn echoed. Others, like TradeLayer founder Patrick Dugan, noted that it also matters whether authors of crypto mixer code profit from their inventions. Samourai allegedly earned at least $4.5 million in fees from its wallet and mixer services, according to the indictment. “The case will ultimately come down to any revenue mechanism the developers may have used that might constitute an operating enterprise in the eyes of prosecutors, making them culpable for money laundering done by proxy,” Dugan said, mentioning that, unlike Tornado Cash, Samourai did not have a token. Despite the realpolitik of the situation, many in the crypto community see the targeting of crypto mixers as an infringement of the basic human right to privacy. “The government's seizure of Samurai and the arrest of the folks running it is troubling. It feels more like what an authoritarian regime would do rather than a free country. I think people have a fundamental right to privacy in their financial transactions, whether digital or physical,” crypto sleuth Ogle told CoinDesk in an interview. “I'm a big fan of privacy services so I have no moral concerns about what was happening,” said one Bitcoin Lightning developer, who asked to remain anonymous in order to discuss the situation more candidly. “But it seems a bit silly on their part. If I understand the situation correctly these are two American citizens who didn't even do that great a job of covering their tracks. So an arrest is pretty unsurprising.” Others noted that despite the increased heat on privacy services, there will always be demand for these protocols – from legitimate and criminal users. See also: Privacy-Preserving Payments Shouldn't Be 'Niche', Monero Dev Says “Given how easy it is to spin up or use another mixer, this doesn't solve the problem of illicit funds being washed," Ogle said. "It just pushes it to another service.” Dugan noted that there are also privacy coins already in circulation for "for those seeking pure Exit via cryptocurrency privacy," though "it ain't easy." He added, "use monero, it's been delisted almost everywhere, so you know it's legit." Zooko WIlcox, founder of privacy coin Zcash, told CoinDesk: “It’s legal to create privacy technology in the USA, and we’re going to keep doing it, because privacy and freedom are core parts of American civilization.” Additional reporting contributed by Cheyenne Ligon and Nikhilesh De.

583::https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-community-brazil-floods-help/::BeInCrypto::article::Bitcoin Community Suffers in Brazil Floods: How to Help Out::Discover how the Bitcoin community is rallying support for Rolante, RS amidst devastating rains and learn how you can help.::We use cookies to improve your experience.  The federal government installed a crisis office to closely monitor the situation with the rains that hit Rio Grande do Su, Brazil. The level of the Guaíba River reached its highest level since 1941, with more rain expected. To date, more than 37 people have died, and more than 70 have been injured as storms have hit at least 235 municipalities. Among them is one of the most Bitcoiner cities in Brazil, Rolante. Local authorities issued an alert and asked people in risk areas to leave. For instance, in Porto Alegre, the mayor declared a public calamity. As a result, the “Bitcoin é Aqui” community created a campaign to raise resources and funds to help Rolante and the more than 352 thousand people affected. For now, the situation is still critical. Four dams are in emergency, and another nine are in a state of attention. In short, this means that if the rains continue, the water will continue to devastate hundreds of cities in the country’s south. BeInCrypto spoke to a resident of Rolante who said the situation is very difficult. “We need everything. However, the most serious situation is that of the city’s hospitals. We are without any type of service. If someone has a heart attack, there’s no way to respond,” Maria da Silva told BeInCrypto Read more: A Basic Guide On How Bitcoin Transactions Work Da Silva, who is now a volunteer, works on cleaning and rebuilding the city, and is appealing to the public to send equipment and water, among other things, urgently. “If you have a company and want to donate supplies, cleaning materials, mattresses, medicines, tarpaulins and everything needed at this moment, get in touch by inbox and express your idea,” da Silva added. It is possible to send donations in Brazilian Real and Bitcoin. These are the addresses: The director of Rolante Hospital also made an appeal for help. The first floor was completely flooded, explains Luis Genaro Ladereche Figoli, who manages the institution. The water reached emergency sectors, specialty centers, hospitalization areas, radiology, and pharmacy, among other essential areas. Genaro says he does not expect to resume the hospital’s activities in the short term because most of the equipment has been destroyed. The health institution is asking for equipment and cleaning materials donations. A resident of Santa Maria called Gerin.ETF took to X (formerly Twitter) to ask for donations for the city of 300,000 inhabitants. “This week the situation got worse and it has already been declared the ‘Worst natural disaster that has ever occurred here in the south,’ it continues to rain every day, the markets are without products, as the roads are impassable, more than half of the city without water, apart from many establishments closed due to lack of product/water and simply MANY people without a home… After this time without any improvement, I decided to run this campaign in order to help as many people as possible, we need to show our strength as WEB3,” Gerin said. Furthermore, Gerin.ETH has committed to donating the money to institutions that are helping with the tragedy, posting invoices, and recording the delivery of donations. He made three trackable web3 categories available. Finally, the state government created the SOS floods page. There, anyone can find information on how to volunteer and what and how to donate.

Crypto will likely stay politicized until more Democrats pivot their anti-segment stance, he argued, meaning a change in administration could be significant for the space. Novogratz said during a Tuesday earnings call that, following the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs and last month’s block reward halving, he believes bitcoin could keep trading between $55,000 and $75,000 in the near-term. The price of bitcoin (BTC) was at about $61,450 at 12:30 pm ET Tuesday. “I think that’s probably where we are — certainly for this quarter and maybe next quarter — until either the Fed starts cutting rates because the economy finally slows or we get through the election.” Read more: Macro headwinds could spur a ‘boring’ bitcoin summer — or something worse The 2024 presidential election is likely to bring clarity to the crypto regulatory landscape as the segment has increasingly been politicized. Joe Biden and Donald Trump are set to face-off in a rematch as they did four years ago. Just last week, the Biden administration said in a statement that the president would veto a resolution invalidating Securities and Exchange Commission’s Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121 if it reached his desk. The bulletin, introduced in 2022, says crypto custodians should report a liability and “corresponding assets” on their balance sheets for all custodied cryptocurrencies. “It just read to the crypto community as the Democrats saying no to crypto,” Novogratz said of the Biden administration’s comments. “And it’s unfair; there are a ton of Democrats that are pro-crypto…but the power has been held by Elizabeth Warren on the Senate banking committee, [Gary] Gensler and a few others.” The Galaxy CEO likened Democrats’ crypto opposition to party members bad-mouthing dogs. “Can you imagine a party coming out and saying we don’t like dogs?” Novogratz said. “It’s just terrible politics, but that’s where we’re at.” Forbes pegs the number of US dog owners at 65 million. There could be as many as 93 million crypto owners in America, according to recent estimates by Security.org. Pair Biden’s veto possibility with Trump signaling he would be a pro-crypto president, and the differing attitudes become more highlighted. Trump invited Ryan Selkis, founder of crypto data platform Messari, to speak during an event last week at Mar-a-Lago. “There was a shift in the Twitter space; there was a shift in people I spoke to saying, ‘Wow, Republicans good, Democrats bad,’” Novogratz said. “I think that’s kind of dangerous thinking in that broadly, for our industry to thrive, you’re going to need bipartisan support,” he added. “Because you can’t go from one regime to the next and not know where you stand.” Read more from our opinion section: Only a fool would vote on crypto alone After the House of Representatives approved the resolution to reverse SAB 121 in a 228-182 vote, it now moves onto the Senate. Along with across-the-board support from House Republicans, 21 Democrats backed it. Novogratz said a prospective Senate vote would be the “first litmus test” on whether some Democrats would look to pivot their stance on crypto. Though the House has passed several bills out of committee, like the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act, it has not held floor votes on them. Sens. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyom., and Kristen Gillibrand, D-N.Y., brought a new version of their Responsible Financial Innovation Act to the Senate floor last summer, but the bill has not progressed. Read more: Crypto bill update: What legislation is making its way forward? “We’re in an election year, and you’re having a hard time getting Dems and Republicans to do much together,” Novogratz said. “While, for us, this is unbelievably important…broadly it just doesn’t rise to the level of [being] important enough for the mass of Congress to care enough about.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

When will we look down at some real wet floors? Centralisation, KYC and privacy. At some new shoe-grips? Blockchain A prominent Russian Bank – was recently staring wide-eyed at a big data breach of its clients thanks to a couple of vulnerable credit cards. This may sound familiar to the scenario a few years back when massive thefts happened at retail POS (Point of Sale) footprints in the USA. EMV (Europay, Mastercard, Visa) was supposed to be the fix. But criminals managed to fool that fence too. They began putting together clipped smart-card chips with miniature microprocessors and were soon whipping out fake payment cards for POS swipes. Just look at what Gemini Advisory report unravelled – a whopping 93 per cent of the stolen cards had the new chip technology. Of course, hope for EMV sustains when we hear what data from Visa (June 2019) tells – over 3.7 million merchant locations accepted EMV card and this shift to EMV has allowed (those that are done with chip upgrade) the joy of an 87 per cent fall in counterfeit card-related fraud dollar losses (between September 2015 to March 2019). But what about those criminals who are easily applying for and (Phew!) receiving real, legitimate, almost-Real McCoy credit cards with active EMV chips from banks? All they need are synthetic identities (toss in real social security numbers with fake ages and addresses).  McAfee estimates that cybercrime is costing the global economy around $600 billion, or 0.8 pc of global gross domestic product. Sameer Patil, Fellow, International Security Studies Programme and Sagnik Chakraborty, Researcher, Cybersecurity Studies Programme, Gateway House pointed out recently how the Indian economy has gone from being largely cash-based to one more regularly reliant on digital payment systems. And how this shift has brought financial inclusion and reduced corruption, but has also, enlarged the scope of cyber attacks in the payment infrastructure by organised criminal syndicates and hackers, foreign governments and their proxies. Indeed, the cost of each dollar of retail fraud losses has moved from $2.94 to $3.13 between 2018 and 2019 (says another report – a LexisNexis Risk Solutions study). As much as 86 per cent of fraud losses that came in the pockets of mid-to-large e-commerce retailers with digital goods happened due to friendly (1st party) and synthetic ID accounts. Data loss and human tampering – not so hard dots to connect. For credit cards segment – the data loss can happen in many ways. You can see some banks sourcing credit cards Business through their DSA (Direct Selling Agents) or FoS (Feet on Street) contractual workforce at common places – such as shopping malls, retail outlets or at any office campus etc., hence, it is quite susceptible for data loss, because the PII (Personally Identifiable Information) and at times the existing Credit Card details (of other banks) are shared to the bank’s credit cards selling agents or representatives to get new credit from this new bank, explains Dharmaraj Ramakrishnan, Sr. Director- Banking & Payments, FIS. Turns out that the culprit in the case of the recent Russian bank fraud had access to databases as part of his job. All keys on one fob, around one finger Sberbank’s Security Service has finished its internal investigation and Herman Gref, CEO, Chairman of the Executive Board of Sberbank has apologized in a statement that says – “We’ve learned a lot from what happened and we rethought our systems to mitigate the effects of human reliability. I’d like to thank all our customers for the great trust they place in us.” Yes, customers put a lot of trust in these institutions and technologies. The question is – how impenetrable are they – eventually? What if the very idea of trust and data could change, and shake up the way we look at data breaches? Let’s start with KYC (or Know Your Customer) hygiene – that is a key part of trust on the bank’s side too. Is the centralized nature of this KYC data a big vulnerable point, somehow? Any centralised data storage is vulnerable because it gives a single point of the target for malicious actors, aver experts from Gateway House. Altaf Halde, Global Business Head, PurpleTeam agrees as well. “Yes, at this point of time, we are all in a situation that is forcing us to duplicate key processes and store our personal documents / digital identities across multiple services and across multiple services. This results in a very poor customer experience. But, more importantly, it increases the risk of attacks and data breaches manifold.” But Ramakrishnan from FIS prefers to differ. “The business framework embedded with the data protection framework is important to safeguard the system. From my perspective, the centralized data verification is the right way to go as it is the single source of truth, provided the centralised database is up to date. As we advance on technology, we should use the right technology for the right use case with the right architecture for fetching and validating the data points.” He, however, opines the use of new approaches for KYC. “The regulator can request the bank not to collect the PII or credit card details from the potential clients, in turn, collect use technology to validate the data points in real-time by integrating with other options.” The Pin-Cushion Murder Trick Banks or financial institutions or payment industry players, there is more than financial damage that unfolds whenever cards are breached. There are data-loss and privacy-intrusion – there is a reason why the black market of identity data is on such a tear. “Data breach may involve PII, business secrets, financial information or even intellectual property. In the financial segment, the common data breach revelations include personal information of the customers as well as their demographic information. These kinds of breaches can lead to financial frauds, business loss or even customer loss.” Ramakrishnan spells it out. So if not EMV then what next? News has it that Visa is working on a platform for helping its engineers pick speed in testing advanced Artificial-Intelligence (AI) algorithms that can detect and prevent credit card fraud. Banks can spend as much as $12.4 billion in 2023 on AI – for initiatives like fraud analysis – as per IDC estimates But what if the data that AI algorithms crunch still resides on the servers or infrastructure of a financial player? Again, a one-stroke affair for anyone who wants to steal it. Let us also not be blind to the brisk rise of adversarial AI. Attackers are getting even more sophisticated to dupe deep-learning systems as time clicks by. Halde reminds how we are all witness to the fact that in recent times, these risks are growing by the second. If a breach happens, the entire data or partial data gets compromised that are in the central repository. Hence, it is always advised to make use of upcoming technologies including blockchain to face these upcoming technological threats. Blockchain can be introduced in a phased manner to decentralize the KYC process, Gateway House experts suggest the same. Ramakrishnan also recommends a technology-based process that can avoid the manual data collection and protect the data points using data encryption at the database level. As the McAfee report underlined, the financial world needs to move over to open data architectures, standardisation of threat data, means of faster and deeper collaboration among security authorities and players spread all across the globe. The means to a lot of these solutions – even reporting, interestingly, can lie in one place – the blockchain. It is important to understand that the payment industry does not want data to be stolen, hence in most cyberattack cases, banks and payment solution providers are transparent, as Gateway House experts argue as well. “However, the need is for data breaches and cybersecurity incidents to be reported immediately.” A policy research paper by Gateway House in collaboration with the Swift Institute also had an interesting recommendation in the same vein: Payment processors should enable consumers to control data through a consent dashboard whereby they can review, modify or delete their personal and payments data on websites, such as e-commerce sites. Plus, it noted that the payment industry must create an industry-wide platform to share classified, unclassified and open-source information on cyber-attacks and threat vectors. Like a clever assassin who murders more than one target in the same spot to make it hard to trace who killed someone and why – a clever security strategy can also use this decentralized effect to its advantage. Spread the targets and weaken the force. Make the system trust-less and inject real trust. Give the power of control back to those who suffer the most when big-ticket thefts happen. The arrival of blockchain makes all this not just plausible but practically-easy now. It is not the only answer, but it can be a good one to start with. The only thing that makes it tough is the will to let go of data control. It is not an overhaul of technology but of a hard-entrenched mindset. Not so easy to swipe away. It is not a credit card, after all. Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

586::https://cryptobriefing.com/sec-cybersecurity-report-hack/::Crypto Briefing::article::Undisclosed report reveals SEC cybersecurity flaws before fake Bitcoin ETF approval hack::The SEC appears to act inconsistently with the standards it enforces on public companies.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article A previously undisclosed report detailed deficiencies in the SEC’s cybersecurity program. The report, first shared publicly by Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett on X, was dated December 20, 2023, less than a month before a false announcement of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval that led to market upheaval and $90 million in Bitcoin liquidations. “Remember the SEC’s X account hack from January 9th? The last update from the agency on January 22 stated that it was working with the Office of the Inspector General and several outside agencies, including the FBI, about the incident,” Terrett said. “But apparently in 2023, the SEC OIG got an independent company to look at its information security program which includes cybersecurity/infrastructure security and found it was lacking. The report is buried on the SEC’s website and dated December 20, 2023,” she added. According to the report, the SEC’s cybersecurity infrastructure was “not effective.” The report also noted that the SEC “needs additional improvement” in several areas “to effectively mitigate security weaknesses.” Despite the critical nature of these findings, Terrett noted that SEC Chairman Gary Gensler did not disclose this information to Congress in the aftermath of the January 9 hack. The oversight raises questions about the SEC’s transparency and the effectiveness of its cybersecurity measures, particularly given its role in regulating the cybersecurity practices of companies listed on the stock exchange.

587::https://theconversation.com/bitcoin-what-elon-musks-u-turn-on-tesla-payments-means-for-future-of-crypto-160891::The Conversation::article::Bitcoin: what Elon Musk’s U-turn on Tesla payments means for future of crypto::Bitcoin prices have plunged after the world’s second richest person tweeted that Tesla would no longer accept the cryptocurrency.::Tesla’s relationship with cryptocurrencies has been a stop-start rollercoaster. In February, the electric vehicle manufacturer announced it had purchased US$1.5 billion (£1.1 billion) of bitcoin and planned to accept the cryptocurrency in future as a means of payment from its customers. The price of the largest cryptocurrency surged that day from just over US$39,000 to US$46,000, on its way to an all-time high of almost US$65,000 in April – and a paper profit of well over US$1 billion for Tesla. Fast-forward a few short weeks and the situation has changed entirely. First came the news in late April that Tesla had sold 10% of its bitcoin holdings, reportedly to demonstrate the digital currency’s liquidity. And more importantly, Musk has now announced on Twitter that Tesla has suspended purchases using bitcoin amid concerns about the “rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels” used in mining the cryptocurrency. This has prompted a huge sell-off in the crypto markets, with bitcoin plunging from around US$55,000 to the mid-US$45,000s, before recovering to around US$50,000 at the time of writing.    The concerns around bitcoin’s carbon footprint are hardly new. Its network is secured by “miners” using arrays of supercomputers to compete in very complex number-guessing games, which uses large amounts of electricity. As has been well reported, this is the equivalent usage of a medium-sized country – currently Egypt – and the power consumption can be followed in real-time here. Worse, much of this mining relies on coal-fired power in China, although many in the crypto industry contend that the impact is far more moderate than suggested. Read more: Bitcoin isn't getting greener: four environmental myths about cryptocurrency debunked Either way, it is difficult to believe that Musk and Tesla were not aware of these issues at the start of the year. And the fact that Tesla still intends to keep bitcoin on its balance sheet makes the announcement even more confusing – both because it seems inconsistent with Musk’s fears about carbon emissions, and because Tesla’s investment could be damaged by the falling price of bitcoin. As it happens, the company’s share price has been fairly steady since the story broke. A rising tide lifts all boats but the opposite can also be true. The concern for cryptocurrency investors is whether the downward shift in price marks the beginning of the end for the current bitcoin bull run, which has seen the price rise roughly fivefold since October 2020. Prices in the whole crypto market have already tanked since Musk’s announcement. Alternatively, is this simply another of the many historical bumps in the road as the new currency on the block aspires to become one of the largest in the world? In terms of its total aggregate market value, bitcoin is currently just outside the world’s top ten currencies. Bitcoin price chart The contradiction with bitcoin is that it is comparatively old tech but still the market leader. Slow, energy-inefficient and often expensive to use, it is diesel power in an age of electrification. Nonetheless it boasts a huge network of users, who are bullish on potential slated upgrades such as Taproot, which aims to improve privacy and may also improve transaction efficiency, and the Lightning Network, which aims to make transactions faster and cheaper. Bitcoin remains top dog among cryptocurrencies, with 42% of total market value. There are numerous alternative coins with far stronger sustainability credentials, including big names like stellar, ripple and cardano. But first-mover advantage still counts for a lot in tech. This is especially true in crypto, where currencies rely heavily on rates of adoption and faith in a product that is only as strong as the collective belief of the user base. Above all, bitcoin has two big selling points: it is hardwired to only ever amount to 21 million coins (with over 18 million already mined), and it is not dominated by any single organisation but is decentralised among thousands of large owners. At a time when (centralised) nations are debasing their currencies by creating more and more money through quantitative easing, and keeping interest rates so low that it is difficult for investors to make money, a currency with a finite supply is likely to remain very attractive. This is why so many corporates and individuals have been dipping their toes in the choppy crypto waters in recent months. Crypto investors can console themselves that Tesla is not selling its bitcoin holdings. For the moment at least, crypto exchanges are not going to have to be processing large sell orders from the world’s biggest car company. One other thing to note in Musk’s statement is that he said that Tesla was also potentially interested in accepting payments in cryptocurrencies with less than 1% of bitcoin’s energy footprint. Musk has previously expressed his apparent affinity for the original joke coin turned top ten cryptocurrency, dogecoin, declaring himself “the Dogefather” – and making reference to the currency in his recent appearance on Saturday Night Live. Dogecoin is certainly low-energy, albeit neither scarce nor decentralised. So it is possible that Tesla may pivot to dogecoin as a treasury asset and functional currency to supplement its existing bitcoin holdings. Indeed, earlier this week, Musk ran a poll on his Twitter account, asking, “Do you want Tesla to accept doge?” The overwhelming answer from his followers was “yes”. Whether Musk gives them what they want or backs some other cryptocurrency like ethereum or ripple, all eyes will certainly be on him to see what happens next. As for bitcoin, analysts will be scouring the earnings statements of the biggest companies to see if any have moved the cryptocurrency into their treasuries. This part of the financial world is never short of drama, and there’s bound to be more right around the corner.::2021-05-13T17:25:27Z::Bitcoin, Blockchain, Crypto, Cryptocurrency, Dogecoin, Elon Musk, Ethereum, Tesla::Gavin Brown::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/400592/original/file-20210513-13-1nfj23w.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=113%2C154%2C3807%2C1900&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
588::https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/05/06/the-sec-cant-stop-suing-crypto-companies/::CoinDesk::article::The SEC Can’t Stop Suing Crypto Companies::Robinhood apparently made strenuous efforts to comply with the agency, even applying to become a special purpose crypto broker-dealer. The SEC is likely to sue for alleged securities violations in any case.::Robinhood is the latest firm to draw the ire of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This weekend, it reported receiving a Wells notice – an announcement that the securities watchdog is building a case and intends to sue. In an 8-K filing, the fintech firm revealed it received the letter from the SEC’s enforcement division for alleged securities violations. This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here. At this point, it’s hard to be surprised by the SEC’s anti-crypto actions – shameless though they may be. Apparently, the agency sent the notice after Robinhood cooperated with the SEC’s investigative subpoenas about its crypto operations. A Wells notice is essentially the last chance the accused has to convince regulators that it didn’t break the law, which would be a sign of good faith except that the vast majority of these letters end up in a lawsuit. As Robinhood legal, compliance, and corporate lead Dan Gallagher noted in a statement, the firm has been in direct communication with the SEC over its crypto offerings for years, which is exactly what you’d expect from a firm that really only dabbles in crypto. It’s not clear from the letter which tokens are considered securities by the SEC, though it’s worth noting the brokerage proactively delisted a number of tokens — including Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC) and Cardano (ADA) — in response to previous SEC lawsuits against rival trading firms. “We firmly believe that the assets listed on our platform are not securities and we look forward to engaging with the SEC to make clear just how weak any case against Robinhood Crypto would be on both the facts and the law,” Gallagher said. He noted in particular the firm’s “years of good faith attempts to work with the SEC for regulatory clarity” and, like other crypto firms in legal limbo, “well-known attempt to ‘come in and register.’” Further, in heeding “the SEC’s calls,” Robinhood attempted to register as a special purpose broker-dealer with the agency. While there are many licensed crypto firms, so far Prometheum Ember Capital, a trading company that doesn’t yet offer any assets to trade, is essentially alone in receiving a special purpose broker-dealer license, which were introduced in 2020 to allow firms to custody and transact in “crypto asset securities.” While just speculation, I have a sense the SEC started to build a case right around the time Gallagher, himself a former SEC commissioner and securities law expert, testified before Congress that the SPBD process is irrevocably broken and a profound waste of resources. To wit: “When Chair Gensler at the SEC in 2021 said, ‘Come in and register,’ we did,” Gallagher said in a June 2023 House Agriculture Committee crypto hearing. “We went through a 16-month process with the SEC staff trying to register [as] a special purpose broker-dealer. And then we were pretty summarily told in March that that process was over and we would not see any fruits of that effort.” So, to sum up, the SEC announced intentions to sue a firm for failing to register for a license after seemingly denying the firm that very license (though to be accurate, the SPBD licenses are given out by self-regulatory organization FINRA). This fits with a long pattern. Since coming into office in 2021, SEC Chair Gary Gensler has made it his business to rein in the crypto industry, which he says is under his remit (an arguable contention). These efforts dramatically increased in the wake of the collapse of FTX, which was particularly embarrassing for U.S. regulators given how cozy Sam Bankman-Fried was with them. The SEC now spends a disproportionate amount of time and money pursuing legal challenges against crypto firms both large and small. The agency has filed at least one lawsuit per month since last November against a crypto company, the majority of which go unnoticed and typically end in a settlement. “The SEC just sent a Wells notice to Robinhood. The number they've sent about crypto in recent months is astonishing. It's hard to imagine that they would (or could) bring so many enforcement actions at once,” Variant Fund legal lead Jake Chervinsky said on X. “It seems like they're abusing the Wells process as a scare tactic now.” See also: Consensys, a Target for the SEC's Assault on ETH, Is Fighting Back | Opinion In some sense, these lawsuits — particularly the ones brought against big name firms like Coinbase and Robinhood — are an attempt to signal that crypto is essentially lawless. This is not squarely the fault of the SEC, but also that Congress slept on crypto regulation for over a decade and is now hampered by partisan gridlock. “I don’t know why [the SEC] did what they did. But there’s no going back on rules now,” Beau J. Baumann, a PhD. candidate at Yale Law School, and co-author of an influential crypto law paper, told CoinDesk in an interview. “In that sense, the whole thing is bad faith. If the enforcement actions are unlawful, writing a rule is way more obviously so.” “Congress should enact new legislation to avoid legal pitfalls, but it’s unclear to me whether they actually will,” Baumann added. Gensler, for his part, has stated directly that he doesn’t think crypto needs bespoke legislation or guidance, given his view that everything crypto, bar bitcoin, walks and talks like securities. While the SEC has had legal victories, it’s suffered many court losses as well. It remains to be seen whether Robinhood will actually get sued, and if so whether it goes the way of Coinbase and Consensys and mounts its own offensive legal campaign. If there is a silver lining here, it’s that, after years of trying to eat the entire crypto pie, Gensler’s SEC may have bitten off more than it could chew. Robinhood’s stock dipped in pre-market trading today, but has since bounced back, an indication in part that the market doesn’t take this action seriously, at least materially-speaking. Afterall, even if the SEC wins, it’s hard to imagine the tangible benefits of preventing people from trading Stellar lumens (XLM) or dogecoin (DOGE).

589::https://beincrypto.com/investors-overvalue-bitcoin-volatility/::BeInCrypto::article::Investors Overestimate the Benefits of Bitcoin Volatility: Fidelity::Learn how Bitcoin's real volatility is less than perceived, influencing investment decisions in the crypto market.::We use cookies to improve your experience.  As Bitcoin (BTC) matures into a staple of investment portfolios, the prevailing view of its volatility remains exaggerated mainly. This overestimation could lead investors to misunderstand the risks and opportunities associated with this cryptocurrency. Despite the long-standing debate on its volatility, many investors still view it as far more unstable than traditional assets. Yet, recent data indicate it may be less volatile than previously believed, even when compared to high-profile stocks like Netflix. Over the last two years, its volatility was lower than Netflix’s, with Bitcoin’s 90-day realized volatility averaging 46% versus Netflix’s 53%. This trend marks a significant shift from its earlier, more erratic price movements and suggests Bitcoin is gradually maturing as an asset class. “This may be pointing to a growing belief that Bitcoin is maturing, further accelerated by the landmark approvals of several spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products in the US. The anticipation of this event may have led to a steady increase in price, up 150% in 2023, and a steady decrease in realized volatility, down 20% in 2023,” Zack Wainwright and Chris Kuiper, Research Analysts at Fidelity Digital Assets, wrote. Read more: What Causes Bitcoin Volatility? Fidelity Digital Assets researchers also highlighted that contrary to popular belief, its volatility is not an outlier among influential stocks, the ‘Magnificent Seven.’ As of October 2023, Bitcoin showed lower volatility than 92 of the S&P 500 stocks, including many large-cap and mega-cap stocks. The market often overestimates its implied volatility, which remains higher than the actual realized volatility. This gap suggests traders are pricing in risks that aren’t as pronounced in actual price movements, pointing to an exaggerated view of Bitcoin’s instability. Like gold following its decoupling from the US dollar, the volatility has diminished. Gold initially saw high volatility, which stabilized as markets adapted to its status as an independent asset. Bitcoin’s recent behavior mirrors this pattern, indicating it may be on a similar trajectory toward stability and significant growth potential. “Although past performance is no guarantee of future results, investors have historically experienced large price increases in short periods once all-time highs in price were revisited and subsequently broken under these circumstances. After a doubling in price, Bitcoin historically has continued this run higher until realized volatility rises to a level where Bitcoin price is becoming overheated,” Wainwright and Kuiper concluded.

The L3 built for the memecoin community Degen “After a custom config change on Friday at [2 pm ET] 11 am PT, two Conduit chains, Degen and Proof of Play’s Apex, stopped posting batches for more than 24 hours. Upon resuming, the first batches triggered reorgs on both chains,” Conduit said. “We’re working with both teams and Offchain Labs to restore service and minimize impact to users,” the post continued. As previously reported by Blockworks, Degen chain was designed to let developers access the memecoin community, and has become especially popular with Farcaster users. “Degen, an ERC-20 token launched in January 2024, has reshaped the Farcaster ecosystem by enabling Casters to reward others with Degen for posting quality content,” Degen’s site said.

Recent reports scream the need for something rugged – better suspension and wiper blades, maybe Whether it is an Uber, a Lyft, a Bird scooter, a Segway, or a Zoomcar; when the road is new and wild, you do not want to toss your baggage and derriere into something that looks iffy. No wonder, in the TokenInsight latest report on crypto exchanges’ security, the average willingness of users to trade on stolen exchanges as well, 2.44. Hardly a surprise, who would want to hitch a hike when the driver is clueless and clumsy. As much as $1.6 billion worth of digital currency assets has been stolen from exchanges from 2014 to the first half of 2019, as per TokenInsight statistics. With $200 million stolen in the first half of 2019, already! The years 2017 and 2018 together saw over ten security breaches occurring on exchanges. This was supposed to come down as time passes and the industry matures. But nah. This is the highest in nearly five years combined! The Rocky Mountains, Wobbly Tyres There’s more to the skid-marks. The change in security incidents over time have been on the heels of a similar growth trend to market volatility and the price of crypto-currencies. Note that the maximum amount of funds stolen occurred at the end of the bull market. And from 2014 and 2018, crypto-currency exchanges had the most substantial amount of funds stolen. What is helpful, and worrisome, as seen tucked beneath these break-ins is the role that exchanges play, or don’t. About 88 per cent of the security incidents in recent years can be easily pinned down upon the shoulders of exchange platforms. User concerns about exchange security also include factors like exchange API, internal management experience, phishing websites, vulnerability detection, website stability. Let us see what we find if we comb through statistical analysis on security incidents done by TokenInsight – seen from June 2016 to June 2019, including, but not limited to, trading anomalies caused by hacker attacks, fund theft, and system problems caused by internal or external factors. Among the incidents seen from Top 40 exchanges, 60 per cent will be attributable to the exchanges themselves, and 40 per cent to phishing website attacks and improper information handling of users What does that tell about an exchange’s sturdiness and caffeine-kettles? A lot. But there’s more to this broken glass pane. What’s in the Trunk, Fella? Have a gander at the Blockchain Transparency Institute (BTI) April report. It unravelled 17 of the CMC Top 25 exchanges to be over 99 per cent fake with many greater than 99.5 per cent fake volumes, including 35 of the top 50 adjusted volume rankings. Not only that, over 60 per cent of all exchanges ranked on popular data sites showed little to no volume – and these were found to be over 96 per cent fake each. Tactics range from – using twitter followers and likes, filling up fake order books, mirror wash trading the largest exchanges with real volume to trying to disguise their wash trading using various bot settings to not affect the price – as BTI figured out. When it dug into many of these exchanges with 99 per cent+ fake volumes, it also noted that many share the same trading engine and design. In other words, on its list of the top 40 largest exchanges with actual volume, Bitcoin’s volume was ascertained to be about 65 per cent fabricated! This echoes in strange patterns that another set of researchers gathered up in their shovels too. Matthew Hougan, Hong Kim, and Micah Lerner from Bitwise Asset Management in May 24, 2019, pointed out in the report ‘Economic and Non-Economic Trading In Bitcoin: Exploring the Real Spot Market For The World’s First Digital Commodity’ that roughly 95 per cent of reported trading volume in bitcoin is fake or non-economic in nature. They also showed why fake volume does not influence price discovery in the real bitcoin spot market. The real spot market for bitcoin is significantly smaller, more regulated, and more efficient than commonly understood, as this report argued. They underlined strongly that ‘a digital commodity, bitcoin’s spot trading market should be among the most orderly and efficient in the world.’ Look at another report, the March 2019 one by TheTie, a crypto trading tool and data platform and you will see that it, too, indicated that 87 per cent of reported crypto trading volume was fake. So if everything is so sketchy and flimsy, is all hope lost on exchanges? More Muscle, Less Gloss Turns out that it is the largest exchanges and most popular exchanges that have emergency mechanisms established. Like emergency funds, insurance, real-time alert detection etc. Also aside from internal improvements on internal security mechanisms, crypto exchanges have also enhanced security measures with the help of external third-party service providers, as TokenInsight discovered in its latest report. There is no denying that security incidents and loss of funds surrounding exchanges have frequently occurred in various scales but as cryptocurrency exchanges pay more attention to security issues and invest more into their internal systems, the overall problem has become increasingly more mature. What is intriguing here is that, in general, users believe that both the largest exchanges and emerging rising exchanges with significant accurate trading volumes are safer. Also, industry users currently have a high sense of trust with the largest exchanges. What could explain this preference for a bigger vehicle than a swanky, fast car? A SUV instead of a Beemer or a Beetle? Analyst Bingyao Song from TokenInsight observes that the basics of large-scale exchanges are high-quality assets. “The liquidity, trading depth and security of exchanges are better than those of small exchanges. For example, the investor protection fund established after the theft of Binance can not only regain the partial trust of users but also demonstrate the strength of the exchange itself.” Yes, users are curious to know if, after a security incident occurs, an exchange will directly declare bankruptcy for failure to pay off debts to users or compensate users’ funds? That explains why investor protection fund and Insurance clauses have started showing up. But the proportion is still low, as only eight of the TOP40 exchanges were found to have such mechanisms in place when TokenInsight studied the risk compensation mechanisms of exchanges for users. Users are telling a lot to exchanges and giving new chances to pull up their socks and ground-clearance. TokenInsight’s survey reveals that in terms of technology, users have a high degree of recognition for ‘the strength of an exchange’s development and technical team, which guarantees the security of the exchange’, with an average score of 4.29. The higher the disclosure of the strength of an exchange’s technical team, the more confident users are in the security of the exchange Look again at the parking spot Experts have also put emphasis on other efforts like self-regulation via revenue reporting, evidence of reserves, custodial protocols, algorithmic tools and ways to spot inconsistencies between metrics like website traffic and reported volumes. May be larger exchanges have better pockets, time-strengths and wheels to get going on this tougher pit-stop that would fix deep and not just air-blow nuts on a moving car. It’s a good sign and a hope it does not peter out. Trust is the brawn that the industry and users need desperately as we move forward. If big jeeps that hold their grip on a tough road can do it better, so be it. Just don’t sputter midway.

592::https://cryptobriefing.com/binance-dwflabs-wsj-allegations/::Crypto Briefing::article::Binance fires investigator for exposing market manipulation with DWF Labs — WSJ::Binance's compliance is under scrutiny after the alleged dismissal of a whistle-blowing employee.::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article Binance has reportedly fired a member of its market-surveillance team who uncovered evidence of market manipulation by DWF Labs, one of the exchange’s high-profile clients. According to a Wall Street Journal report, the dismissed employee and his colleagues had identified instances of pump-and-dump schemes and wash trading by “VIP” clients, including DWF Labs. The market-surveillance team, which was hired to identify signs of market manipulation and other illicit activities as part of Binance’s efforts to improve its compliance practices, found that “VIP” clients – those trading more than $100 million per month – were engaging in activities prohibited by Binance’s terms and conditions. DWF Labs, a prolific investor in crypto projects that emerged in early 2023, was reportedly making over $4 billion in monthly trades on the exchange. Binance has denied the claims, stating that it rejected allegations of permitting market manipulation and that the employee was dismissed after an inquiry found the accusations against the client were not “fully substantiated.” “Binance emphatically rejects any assertion that its market surveillance program has permitted market manipulation on our platform,” a spokesperson from the exchange said. DWF Labs also responded to the article, claiming that the allegations were “unfounded and distort the facts.” “It has come to our attention that a recent article contains many allegations that we believe to be unfounded and that do not accurately represent our ethical business practices,” DWF Labs said in an announcement through its Telegram channel. The investigators submitted a report alleging that DWF Labs had manipulated the prices of several tokens through $300 million worth of wash trades in 2023. However, Binance determined that there was insufficient evidence of market abuse, the WSJ report states. A specific token linked to Web3 gaming, YGG, was named alongside six other tokens. YGG is a token launched by Yield Guild Games, a Web3 firm which has key leadership from the Philippines, where Binance is currently banned. A recent statement from Binance further said that it was “unaware” of the documents, arguing that these allegations were “very concerning” if proven to be true. The exchange’s founder, Changpeng Zhao, has been sentenced to four months in prison after the exchange was embroiled in a series of legal battles.

593::https://theconversation.com/nfts-an-overblown-speculative-bubble-inflated-by-pop-culture-and-crypto-mania-174462::The Conversation::article::NFTs, an overblown speculative bubble inflated by pop culture and crypto mania::The craze among celebrities for Bored Ape NFTs suggests speculation has become completely detached from any idea of fundamental value.::Comedian Robin Williams once called cocaine “God’s way of telling you you are making too much money”. This role may now have been overtaken by non-fungible tokens, the blockchain-based means to claim unique ownership of easily copied digital assets. The latest NFT mania involves fantastic amounts of money being paid for “Bored Apes”, 10,000 avatars featuring variants of a bored-looking cartoon ape. Last month rapper Eminem (real name Marshall Mathers) paid about US$450,000 in Ethereum cryptocurrency to acquire Bored Ape No. 9055 – nicknamed EminApe, because its khaki and gold chain resembles what Eminem wears. It purportedly joins more than 160 other NFTs in the rapper’s collection. The Bored Ape character seems derivative of the drawings of Jamie Hewlett, the artist who drew Tank Girl and virtual band Gorillaz. According to the creators, each variant is “generated from over 170 possible traits, including expression, headwear, clothing, and more”. They say every ape is unique “but some are rarer than others”. So what does Eminem now own? He has an electronic version of an image, which he is using for his Twitter profile. But then so does anyone who copies it from the internet. The only difference is that he has a record in a blockchain that shows he bought it. He also gets to be a member of the “Bored Ape Yacht Club” a members-only online space whose benefits and purpose beyond being a marketing gimmick are unclear. That’s about it. The intellectual property (such as it is) remains with the creators. He is not entitled to any share of merchandising revenue from the character. He can only profit from his purchase if he can find a “greater fool” willing to pay even more for the NFT. Which is unlikely. While publicity given to the rapper’s purchase certainly seems to have boosted demand, the average price paid for Bored Ape NFTs so far in 2022 is about 83 Ether (currently about US$280,000). Eminem may have been prepared to pay much more for the one that looked more like him; but would anyone else? NFTs are a highly speculative purchase. The basis of the market is proof of unique ownership, which only really matters for bragging rights and the prospect of selling the NFT in the future. NFT mania arguably combines the most tawdry and avaricious aspects of collectibles and blockchain markets with celebrity culture. Eminem’s monster payment in particular has lent credibility to the idea these NFTs have value. But he is not the only celebrity who has helped attract attention to the Bored Ape NFTs. Others to buy into the hype include basketball stars Shaquille O’Neal and Stephen Curry, billionaire Mark Cuban, electronic dance music DJ Steve Aoki, YouTuber Logan Paul and late-night television host Jimmy Fallon. These well-publicised purchasers effectively act as a form of celebrity endorsement – a tried and true marketing tactic. It is a graphic example of the power of media culture to stoke “irrational exuberance” in financial markets. There has been a shift away from traditional investments and sources of investment advice. With prices disconnected from any future cash flows, there is less interest in forecasts from technical experts. Instead people turn to social media and “doing their own research”. One survey in mid-2021 (polling 1,400 investors aged 18 to 40) suggested about a third of Gen Z investors regard TikTok videos as a source of trustworthy investment advice. This has opened up the field for celebrity influencers. Read more: FinTok and 'finfluencers' are on the rise: 3 tips to assess if their advice has value While not illegal, many NFT marketing ventures have some similarities with Ponzi schemes, such as that operated by Bernie Madoff (who sustained his fraud for decades by paying high “dividends” from the deposits of new investors). Cryptocurrency markets work in essentially the same manner. For existing investors to profit, new buyers have to be drawn into the market. So too NFTs, with something illusory attached to the digital assets. Some light on the worth of this attachment compared to the economics of NFTs themselves may come from the interesting (and also highly profitable) experiment by the (now not so) “young British artist” Damien Hirst – himself a master self-promoter. Hirst’s well-publicised “The Currency” project has involved selling NFTs for 10,000 similar but unique dot paintings. The twist is that at the end of a 12-month period those who have bought the NFT must decide if they want the digital token or the physical artwork. If they keep the NFT the artwork will be destroyed. Read more: Damien Hirst's dotty 'currency' art makes as much sense as Bitcoin There’s virtually nothing humans can’t turn into a market. But increasingly there are speculative bubbles in things with absolutely no fundamental value. NFTs have joined Bitcoin and celebrity meme-based cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu as examples of tokens with no intrinsic worth, which speculators just buy in the hope the price will keep rising. Even Dogecoin, started as a satire on these excesses, is now valued at US$20 billion and promoted in Ponzi-like ways. Read more: What is Bitcoin's fundamental value? That's a good question Some studies have suggested tweets or Facebook posts can now drive stock prices. Elon Musk’s tweets certainly seem to have a large impact on cryptocurrency prices. We now appear to be in the monster of all speculative bubbles. The creators of assets like NFTs will do well. It is not so clear about the holders. Nor will the impact of NFT crashes be restricted just to the NFT market. Speculators, particularly if they have borrowed heavily, may need to liquidate other assets as well. This is all likely to make all financial markets more volatile. The larger the bubble becomes, the wider the contagion when it bursts.::2022-01-13T01:33:24Z::Art market, Asset prices, Bitcoin, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, Damien Hirst, Dogecoin, Financial bubbles, Financial literacy series, Non-fungible tokens::John Hawkins::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/439935/original/file-20220110-26-xvs5yd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=40%2C747%2C4500%2C2250&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
594::https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/05/17/binance-exec-tigran-gambaryan-denied-bail-by-nigerian-court/::CoinDesk::article::Binance Exec Tigran Gambaryan Denied Bail by Nigerian Court::The Nigerian court also ruled that the Binance exchange can be served the FIRS tax evasion charges through its executive Tigran Gambaryan.::Detained Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan’s bail application was denied by a Nigerian court on the grounds that there is a likelihood that he will manage to jump bail, the spokesperson for the executive’s family said on Friday. Binance and the executives’ money laundering, tax evasion and the exchanges detained Head of Compliance Tigran Gambaryans bail hearings all occurred on Friday in Nigeria. The court ruled that Binance can be served with the Federal Inland Revenue Service tax evasion charge through Gambaryan. Tigran’s lawyers objected to the application on the grounds that they needed to review the amended charge to advise Gambaryan on taking his plea. The court agreed to adjourn the matter to May 22 for arraignment, where charges are formally laid against the defendant. Gambaryan, who turned 40 on Friday, has been detained in Nigeria since February when he arrived with the British-Kenyan regional manager for Africa, Nadeem Anjarwalla. Anjarwalla has since escaped. “I truly cannot believe that my innocent husband is now - on his 40th birthday - having to face a trial for charges that he has nothing to do with,” said Yuki Gambaryan, the wife of Tigran Gambaryan. “The whole world is watching what he is being put through, and I just pray that common sense and justice will prevail and that Tigran will be allowed to come home to us.” A month after the exchange’s executives were detained in the country, they, along with the exchange, were charged with money laundering and tax evasion. Gambaryan was later moved to Kuje prison, which also houses the likes of members of the Boko Haram terrorist group. Nigeria’s Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) money laundering trial commenced on Friday with a Nigerian prosecutor who called on Abdulkadir Abbas from the Nigerian SEC as the first prosecution witness. After the prosecution finished examining their first witness, Tigran’s lawyers asked for a stand down—which means to put a matter on hold for a short while—to obtain certified records of certain documents in the proof of evidence to be used in their cross-examination of the witness. The court adjourned the trial until May 23 at noon. “We are deeply disappointed that Tigran Gambaryan, who has no decision-making power in the company, continues to be detained. Tigran has been dedicated to public service and fighting crime for most of his life. These charges against him are completely meritless. He should be freed while discussions continue between Binance and Nigerian government officials," a Binance Spokesperson said. Binance’s CEO Richard Teng recently released a blog post calling on the Nigerian government to release Gambaryan.

595::https://beincrypto.com/core-scientific-earnings-report-q1-2024/::BeInCrypto::article::Core Scientific Rises from Ashes, Reports $210 Million Gain in Q1 2024::Bitcoin miner Core Scientific reported $150 million revenue and $210.7 million net income in Q1 2024, showcasing a major financial rebound.::We use cookies to improve your experience.  Core Scientific, a Texas-based Bitcoin mining company, has announced impressive gains in both revenue and profitability for the first quarter of 2024. It reported a revenue of $150 million from digital asset mining, marking a 46% increase in its gross margin. The company’s success results from strategic efficiency and is a part of the broader cryptocurrency market’s recovery. In this quarter, Core Scientific achieved a net income of $210.7 million. This figure starkly contrasts with its performance in the first quarter of 2023, which reported a net loss of $400,000. The improvement was largely due to a gain of $143.8 million from the extinguishment of pre-emergence obligations. The company also reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $88 million. Moreover, Core Scientific ended the quarter with $98.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. Core Scientific showed financial resilience by retiring $19 million in obligations. Payments due for the year on miners have been completed. These steps are essential for its operational expansion. Read more: How Much Electricity Does Bitcoin Mining Use? The company increased its operating income to $55.2 million, up from $7.6 million the previous year. Its total revenue rose to $179.3 million, a $58.6 million increase from the first quarter of 2023. Meanwhile, digital asset mining contributed $150.0 million. Additionally, its mining prowess was showcased by the 2,825 Bitcoin (BTC) mined during the period. These were due to a significant increase in Bitcoin prices and improved mining efficiency. Hosting revenue also showed healthy growth, generating $29.3 million. Both hosting and mining segments benefited from strategic cost management and efficiency gains. However, hosting revenue enjoyed a higher margin due to new client onboarding and efficient cost controls. Core Scientific’s first quarter performance also includes operational enhancements. The company increased its hash rate and deployed new mining equipment. It also expanded its hosting capabilities by adding 16 mega-watts of infrastructure. This was to service a high-performance computing customer ahead of schedule. In his commentary on the results, Adam Sullivan, CEO of Core Scientific, highlighted the strategic moves underpinning these robust figures. “We delivered outstanding results in the first quarter, […] strengthening our balance sheet by paying down debt and improving our cash position, and improving our fleet efficiency with the deployment of new generation miners,” he stated. Following the report, Core Scientific (CORZ) stock surged during after-hours trading. It went from $3.42 at 16.38 ET to $3.75 at 17.59 ET.

BeInCrypto previously reported that Core Scientific regained its footing in January 2024 after the bankruptcy court approved its resolution plans. As Core Scientific looks ahead, the strategic focus appears to be on sustaining this growth trajectory while expanding its operational scope. However, it is important to note that the post-Bitcoin halving effect presents a significant challenge. The Bitcoin halving will reduce miner rewards. At the same time, mining costs will rise. Therefore, this condition will be crucial in determining Core Scientific’s ability to maintain impressive performance in a potentially tougher market environment.

BONK and Adobe Stock modified by Blockworks What are brand-new projects to do in such a topsy-turvy market, one that’s either teetering on the brink of altcoin season or about to veer off into another crypto winter? It’s been about seven months since a fake news tweet from Cointelegraph pushed crypto into overdrive. The market is clearly still confused. The salacious tweet — which reported that the SEC had approved spot bitcoin ETFs for US markets — confirmed a major bitcoin rally that had been brewing all through 2023. Bitcoin surged by two-thirds in the months between the post and official SEC approval in early January, and then by another 80% after the fact. Crypto has since been outright messy. Memecoin, DePIN and computing marketplace projects have pumped, privacy coins have dumped, and ETH is stuck in no-man’s land awaiting approval of its own spot ETFs a la BlackRock’s IBIT. As Jason touches on in today’s Empire podcast episode, creative ways of issuing new tokens have emerged between this cycle and the last. Startups and protocol stewards commonly run private token sales in funding rounds with venture capitalists — which apparently don’t piss off the SEC — before airdropping slices of the circulating supply to users and other early adopters (read: those pesky airdrop farmers). No ICO means no SEC lawsuits, the thinking goes, while the supply ends up with folks who actively use the protocols they power. Seems like a win-win. A byproduct of this New Style of doing crypto business is that token supplies are often drip-dropped into the market over a number of years. It’s now relatively routine for tokens to launch with less than 25% of the supply circulating — and in some cases much less. The rest is kept by the team, early backers and other insiders to fund development, marketing and, eventually, provide ROI. What results is a number of low-float tokens with massively high fully-diluted valuations compared to their actual market caps, a blueprint largely perfected by Sam Bankman-Fried and Alameda Research with Serum and other “Sam Coins.” It all begs the question of whether there’s any correlation between price performance and low-float supply dynamics. There are individual cases: dYdX, for instance, had only 18% of the supply circulating when Cointelegraph’s fake news tweet confirmed the bitcoin bull market and has since released an additional 34% of the supply. dYdX’s price against bitcoin has collapsed by more than half in that time. The airdropped Starknet token is another — it only has 7.3% circulating supply and its bitcoin ratio has also halved. But after analyzing the current top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap, as well as another two dozen or so tokens featured in the top 100 just before the bitcoin bull run really kicked off, broader correlation is harder to find. Tokens at the top of the chart have high floats. Tokens to the right of the dotted line have beaten bitcoin. Brighter circles have increased their supplies more than darker ones. And larger circles have grown bigger market caps. After removing a few outliers, about 40% of the top end of the market have outperformed bitcoin since October. At that time, the median circulating supply for tokens that have gone onto beat bitcoin was 70%. For underperformers, it was 79%. Not exactly a huge difference. Low float cryptocurrencies generally did as well as high floats. Then, the median performance against bitcoin for tokens with circulating supplies of 80% or more was minus 21%. So, high-float tokens appear just as susceptible to losing significant ground as low-floats. Even projects with some of the lowest floats — 19 tokens with under 25% of the supply circulating — on average have beaten BTC by 25%, while the median was almost 1% ahead. But for standout performers, there does appear to be a link. Bitcoin ratios of nearly a dozen top cryptocurrencies have more than tripled since October. Their median circulating supply was 94% before the rally. All those stars were memecoins and DePIN projects, which aside from Bittensor, all had a large majority of their supplies already circulating. A great irony of crypto in 2024 is that perhaps, it’s time to treat memecoin launches as the new standard moving forward. — David Canellis He’s back. I am, of course, talking about the man, the myth, the legend: Roaring Kitty. The return of Keith Gill, the man behind the powerful online persona, sent memestocks and memecoins soaring on Monday. We were left asking one big question: Is history repeating itself? The answer is…maybe? We’re nowhere near the 2021 memestock mania, when GameStop’s stock rose to new heights. And it’s not just the retail investors who benefited from the memestock focus either back then or right now. Pepe, Dogecoin, FLOKI, Dogwifhat and, of course, some random GME-themed memecoins (with no affiliation with the company) gained after Roaring Kitty posted a video suggesting his return. That’s not even mentioning that GameStop’s market cap is back over $9 billion, or that the stock closed up 74% on Monday. AMC, another memestock favorite, closed up 78%. A number of factors made 2021 unique. I’m not saying it’s impossible in this cycle, but the threads may be more similar instead of the exact same. Memecoins dominate today’s market narrative, whereas 2021 saw NFTs booming — nowadays, not so much. There are macro differences, too. Zooming out of crypto, interest rates are sky high with the Federal Reserve holding on to the 5.25%-and-5.50% range since the summer of 2023. Inflation still runs rampant. Retail investors simply aren’t seeing the same economic environment, not to mention the pandemic that was still a thing in 2021. Back then, interest rates were so low that millennials could actually afford to buy houses. The point is: We’re not coming out of lockdown, and we’re seeing crypto bounce back with some weakness after a rough bear market. Of course, that’s not going to stop folks who want to jump into either the memestocks or memecoins. But the conditions don’t look to be ripe enough for a repeat. Just remember: Diamond hands may be forever, but these cycles tend to have a short — and volatile — lifespan. — Katherine Ross Here’s an interesting find: Speculators on the prediction market Polymarket seem to be giving US President Joe Biden similar chances at victory than challenger Donald Trump in a new, major national poll. On Polymarket right now — in a market that has earned more than $125 million worth of bets — Trump leads Biden 49% to 44%. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., meanwhile, pulls a mere 3% — one percentage point less than Michelle Obama, wife of former president Barack Obama. Read more: Stand With Crypto PAC launches as industry interest in campaign funding ramps up Let’s look at the new New York Times poll from this week. Trump leads in an array of battleground states, per the Times/Siena College/Philadelphia Inquirer poll. In two of those states, Trump pulls 49% to Biden’s 42%. Biden fares best in Wisconsin, pulling 47% to Trump’s 45%. Interestingly, RFK Jr. polled around 10% in each of the battleground states — a marker of strength for the independent candidate and much stronger than what the folks on Polymarket are saying. The polls and prediction market aren’t moving in tandem, but at some points, they rhyme. To be sure, the crypto-powered Polymarket has been giving Trump strong chances for months. But it’s a fascinating lens for a major political matchup — I’ll be watching as the bets continue to develop.

The formats can vary. It can be a hardware wallet, a mobile that mines cryptocurrency, a smartphone specially designed for crypto or a point-of-sale solution that is based on blockchain – but the drift is the same – hardware is not just some backyard waste in this industry, anymore. We have just seen Litecoin Foundation announcing a hardware wallet in collaboration with Ellipal, best known for making crypto-compatible smartphones. Just an example of what a report from TokenInsight spelt out recently. The ‘ 2019 Q1 Research Report on Digital Wallet Industry’ shows that over 700 wallet projects have been established by April 2019 and in terms of user visits, the Q1 average UV of hardware wallets is 6,800/day, which is 1.6 times that of software wallets. Of course, when we slice the space from the angle of wallet types, the ratio of software wallets to hardware wallets in the current market is 8:2. We are talking about a quarter where the number of wallet users now exceeds 34 million, reflecting a growth rate of 9 per cent compared with the previous quarter. There is no denying that software weighs heavy on the long tail effect. Hardware and software have their own strengths but it is crucial to hammer them on the right nail at the right time. If not safe, saf-er. If not best, bett-er Do you know that a major growth driver of the global cryptocurrency mining hardware market is nothing else but a spike in demand for cryptocurrency-specific hardware? We are witnessing vendors betting investments in research and development for developing innovative technologies and new products. The quest for improving the hash rate, making mining efficient and reducing power consumption is high right now. That is what analysts see when they augur that the cryptocurrency mining hardware market will register a CAGR of over 10 per cent by 2023 (as per a prognosis by Reportlinker). Hardware, it turns out is quite a strong card in changing the game ahead in an industry that is nothing short of a gamble right now. And why not? Peko Wan, Vice President, Pundi X explains how hardware plays an essential part for mass adoption. “It empowers the operation of blockchain as well as enables the mainstream adoption. Take Function X blockchain, for example, XPOS, Pundi X’s blockchain-based point of sale smart device which operates both as a decentralized point-of-sale device and as a node. As a node, the XPOS helps confirm the transitions which contribute to the operation of the decentralized network. As a point of sale device, it facilitates crypto transactions as easily as buying a bottle of water.” The aspects of security and mining also tilt the scales strongly towards hardware. Recall that the Litecoin wallet is supposed to be a completely connection-free cold wallet isolated from any network. Yes, most of these wallets are well-pronounced on safety, at least in the descriptions. Hardware wallets have physical buttons for transaction confirmations and hence a reduced vulnerability to hackers (at least, lesser than that of software wallets). The Token Insight report underlines the security condition of wallets. It feels that for technical risks, there are mature solutions to the randomness of private keys, secure storage and use risks. But if we consider artificial risks, many effective solutions are available in hardware wallets to defend against security risks. At present, mainstream security authentication methods culled in this report were: static passwords, bio information authentication, graphics unlocking, Google two-factor authentication and dynamic passwords. “Among the 234 software wallets from our statistics, 136 wallets have acquired this data, and the proportion of wallets supporting PINs remains the highest at 26.9 per cent.” The report pointed out. Look at user experience side of digital currency payments, and you will observe that the transfer of encrypted tokens is enjoying more speed, application scenarios and credibility with the emergence of digital asset debit cards, among other things. A blockchain-powered phone which allows users to make calls, send messages, share content via blockchain, taking blockchain application beyond the financial transactions is another case in point. “Pundi X’s XPhone presents a friendly interface making consumers aware of the blockchain technology,” Wan emphasizes. Ware next? So looks like hardware has finally cracked the needs of ease, pervasiveness and security that the blockchain industry was wrestling with.  Or not?  The ReportLinker analysis reminds that fragmentation is something that is still a soft spot in the hardware market. As Wan from Pundi X contends, when asked about scalability and practical weight of hardware innovations: Crypto smartphone is a way to make the mainstream consumers be aware of the use of cryptocurrency. “The adoption of new technology takes time. As technology advances, the adoption of crypto should take off. We see leading device manufacturers explore the potential of this market.” It would help those players build up on the natural edge of hardware by innovating in the right places. A TokenInsight IT Services report dissected that there are more platform-based projects in the industry and that their average market value is higher as well. But the application scenarios in the application category are clearer, and the entry point for solving the problem is smaller. Cloud was first an odd sound in a server-heavy enterprise market, but look at how it upended everything in a matter of a few years. Hardware could be the Netflix of blockchain space too, provided it is switched on when the iron is hot. Imagine what can transpire when the hardware is struck right, loud and well. There is a lot that needs to be lifted in the blockchain yard. Things can turn simple and secure if we get the right cranes. And as to software, we might just have fewer sitting ducks.

Share this article Robinhood Markets, the trading app known for its commission-free trading and role in the 2021 meme stock frenzy, is expected to report its highest quarterly revenue in nearly three years, driven by a steady rebound in equity markets and crypto trading. According to an initial report from Reuters, there has been a resurgence in global markets fueled by bets on interest rate cuts, has attracted traders back to the platform, resulting in higher transaction-based revenue for the retail investor-focused brokerage. Robinhood’s shares have surged 58% in the first three months of the year, marking the sharpest quarterly stock increase since its listing. According to research firm Apptopia, Robinhood’s daily active users jumped 65% in March compared to the previous year, while total new mobile app downloads soared 94% during the same period. The company’s net interest revenue, the biggest driver of its top line, is expected to rise 24% to $258.24 billion in the first quarter, as reported by LSEG data. Robinhood’s assets under custody (AUC) exceeded $100 billion for the second consecutive month in February, and the company reported a surprise profit in the final quarter of 2023, setting its sights on profitable growth in 2024. Analysts from JP Morgan forecast a 24% increase in revenue to $548.61 million for the first quarter, with crypto trading revenue likely to more than double from the previous year to $80 million. Despite the positive outlook, the average recommendation of 17 brokerages covering Robinhood remains a “hold.” The median price target for the company is $19, a 65% increase from three months ago. Robinhood currently trades at 64.01 times its forward earnings estimate, significantly higher than the industry median of 10.97. Although the stock hit a more than two-year high in late March, it has lost more than half its value since its July 2021 market debut. The projection comes as Robinhood faces pressure from the SEC for alleged violations of securities laws. Robinhood will release its Q1 results Wednesday.

As a result, the MtGox Bitcoin exchange stopped allowing withdrawals of Bitcoin from the exchange and this then caused the value of Bitcoin to drop, falling from about $900 USD a week ago to the current price of around $600. Meanwhile another cryptocurrency has brought a new perspective by tying itself to renewable energy. The SolarCoin has been created to promote the use of solar energy. Although SolarCoins can be earned by mining in roughly the same way that Bitcoins are, the majority will only be available in exchange for generating Megawatt Hours of electricity back to the grid. The plan is for consumers who generate solar-powered electricity to receive 1 SolarCoin per Megawatt Hour. In essence, this becomes a “proof of work” which is the basis of creation of other cryptocurrencies. The problem with proofs of work is that they are currently implemented by getting computers to perform repeated calculations. This uses a significant amount of power which is effectively wasted. Using a renewable electricity proof of work is obviously far more attractive from an energy conservation perspective. According to Nick Gogerty, the SolarCoin Foundation spokesman, the target value for a SolarCoin is $20-$30 USD. How the target will be achieved and maintained is not clear. Like all of the cryptocurrency, the actual value depends on what people are prepared to buy the currency at. With SolarCoin, the tie in with solar power generation may prove attractive to the renewable energy sector generally and consumers who are supportive of any effort to reduce greenhouse emissions by using clean energy. As the recent surge in value of the Dogecoin has shown, even a cryptocurrency that started as a joke can become an asset with exchangable value. The Dogecoin, partly as a result of Bitcoin’s woes, currently has a market capitalisation of $90 million USD. The idea of concept-based currencies is a very new idea and one that holds enormous potential. Taking a concept, in the case of SolarCoin, renewable energy, coupled with the idea of using a “proof-of-work” as the basis for the creation of the currency means that these currencies could be tied to any type of work, especially one related to the concept. Imagine for example a UniCoin which is awarded for every course a student completes at University. The coins could be used to pay for books or food on campus or even offset their eventual student loan. If you are having trouble conceptualising the idea of these types of cryptocurrencies, it is worth remembering that they are not that different from currencies like the US dollar that are no longer backed by gold. Currencies like the USD are are a “fiat currency” which only works because collectively we have chosen to believe that a dollar has value. In the meantime, if you want to get SolarCoins, you will be able to exchange Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) for them. A REC usually represents a certificate for the generation of a Megawatt Hour of electricity. In Australia, RECs are usually given to the consumer based on an estimation of the amount of electricity the installed panels will generate over a 15 year period. They are usually handled by the solar panel installation company who discounts the installation costs and claims the RECs on your behalf. This does mean that it would be difficult to be able to use RECs in Australia to get SolarCoins unless you handled them yourself. It would be possible however for electricity companies to become involved with distributing SolarCoins in addition to providing the usual feed-in-tarrifs that they give to people contributing electricity to the grid. Whatever the fate of the SolarCoin, there are undoubtedly going to be many more concept currencies that will follow.::2014-02-12T15:06:16Z::::David Glance::Business ,  Economy::https://images.theconversation.com/files/41382/original/gyqnhqck-1392216400.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
600::https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/17/institutions-still-skeptical-of-a-near-term-bitcoin-rally-cme-options-data-show/::CoinDesk::article::Institutions Still Skeptical of a Near-Term Bitcoin Price Rally, CME Options Data Show::The higher implied volatility for short-dated puts suggests investors are willing to pay a premium for downside protection, CF Benchmarks said.::While upbeat U.S. inflation data released early this week has restored institutional faith in bitcoin’s (BTC) long-term bullish case, it is yet to alleviate concerns of a near-term price pullback. The odds of a near-term rally are still scant, according to CF Benchmarks’ analysis of options trading data on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), a platform widely regarded as a barometer of institutional activity. According to CF Benchmarks, implied volatility for short-dated out-of-the-money (OTM) put options was higher than implied volatility for OTM calls following Wednesday’s softer-than-expected U.S. CPI release. These options are based on CME’s cash-settled standard bitcoin futures contract, which is sized at 5 BTC. “The volatility skew, which represents the difference in implied volatility between out-of-the-money (OTM) puts and calls is quite pronounced in the shorter-dated options. The higher implied volatility [demand] for OTM puts compared to calls suggests investors are still cautious about near-term downside risks and are willing to pay a premium for protective puts,” CF Benchmarks said in a note shared with CoinDesk on Thursday. Put options are derivative contracts that protect the buyer from price drops. A put buyer is implicitly bearish on the market, looking to profit from or hedge against potential price weakness. A call option offers insurance against price rallies. Put options at strikes lower than the going market rate and calls above the spot market price are considered out-of-the-money. Implied volatility is an estimate of the future volatility of the underlying asset based on options prices. Implied volatility rises as demand for options increases. CF Benchmarks is the U.K.-regulated provider of digital assets benchmarks like the CF Bitcoin Volatility Index. CF Benchmarks and CME also publish several crypto-related reference rates, including the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate and CME CF-Ether Dollar Reference Rate. The volatility surface – a three-dimensional plot of the implied volatilities of bitcoin options – shows implied volatilities for short- and long-dated bitcoin options with different deltas or degrees of sensitivity to changes in the price of bitcoin. OTM options’ delta ranges from 0.5 to 0. As can be seen, the post-CPI bias has been for OTM puts expiring in 20 to 40 days. Meanwhile, as we move toward longer-dated options, the skew flips in favor of calls or bullish bets. “This indicates that investors are growing more optimistic about bitcoin’s longer-term prospects and are willing to pay more to be positioned for potential upside by buying OTM calls,” CF Benchmarks said. The chart also shows relatively flat implied volatility levels for longer-dated options, a sign of increased institutional participation. “This could be interpreted as a sign of increasing institutional involvement, as these investors often have a more nuanced view of the market and are less prone to extreme sentiment swings,” CF Benchmarks added. A similar long-term bullish bias is seen in options trading on the cryptocurrency exchange Deribit, which accounts for over 85% of the global crypto options activity. As of writing, notional open interest or the dollar value of the number of open bitcoin options contracts on Deribit was $15.63 billion. Meanwhile, open interest in CME options was $417 million. At the time of writing, bitcoin was trading at $65,550, representing a weekly gain of 6.6%, according to CoinDesk data. Edited by Parikshit Mishra.

601::https://beincrypto.com/lightning-labs-ceo-hints-stablecoins-bitcoin/::BeInCrypto::article::Imminent Arrival of Stablecoins on Bitcoin, Hints Lightning Labs CEO::Lightning Labs is set to integrate stablecoins into the Bitcoin network, enhancing transaction efficiency and reducing costs.::We use cookies to improve your experience.  In a significant move that could redefine financial transactions on Bitcoin (BTC), Lightning Labs is preparing to introduce stablecoins and other tokenized assets. Elizabeth Stark, CEO of Lightning Labs, announced this development during her appearance at FT Live’s Crypto and Digital Assets Summit in London. Stark revealed that the development team at Lightning Labs has already begun trial runs of their new protocol on the Lightning Network. “We released an early part of the code in October and recently demoed the first-ever transaction on Lightning of an asset. The idea is to have crypto dollars and stablecoins on the Bitcoi,” Stark explained. Stablecoins and tokenized assets typically face high fees and scalability issues on other blockchains. Stark remarked that Bitcoin’s network is ideal for these challenges due to its robust security and decentralized nature. Read more: A Guide to the Best Stablecoins in 2024 The initiative benefits from Bitcoin’s Taproot upgrade, which was implemented in late 2021. This upgrade boosts the blockchain’s scripting abilities and privacy features. It supports complex contracts and wider use cases necessary for stablecoins. In October 2023, the company launched the Taproot Assets protocol’s alpha version on the main network. This move enables the issuance of assets like stablecoins on the Bitcoin network. Additionally, Stark highlighted the rising role of stablecoins in regions plagued by economic instability, high inflation, or falling fiat currencies. “The stickiest users have been those looking for a stable store of value. In some cases, they’re using Bitcoin. In other cases, they’re using stablecoins, and in some cases, it’s a combination of both,” she noted. Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC) now hold more US Treasury bonds than many major nations, highlighting the increasing importance of stablecoins as key financial instruments. Stark pointed out that although stablecoin holders do not earn interest, the security and stability of these digital assets are invaluable. Stark also touted the advantages of using the Lightning Network for these transactions. “Compared to traditional systems like Visa, where fees in the U.S. can be as high as 3%. The cost of transacting stablecoins on the Lightning Network can be dramatically lower, often just a cent or less,” she said. She further detailed the role of Lightning Labs in the evolving digital asset ecosystem and said it will be the infrastructure. She explained that the infrastructure Lightning Labs is developing will enable other financial institutions to issue real-world tokenized assets. These include gold and fiat-backed instruments. By integrating stablecoins and other assets into its system, Bitcoin is set to broaden its use not only as an investment but also as a medium of exchange. This expansion will enhance its appeal and utility, increasing its reach in the financial world.

602::https://blockworks.co/news/ftx-comparison-crypto-bankruptcies::Blockworks::article::Why FTX is different from other crypto bankruptcies::While FTX seems to be nearing the finish line, it is just one of a handful of crypto bankruptcies that occurred in 2022.::FTX seems to be nearing the finish line almost two years after initiating the bankruptcy process Ivan Babydov/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks FTX is nearing the end of its bankruptcy proceedings almost two years after initiating the process. This comes just a few months after its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, was sentenced to 25 years in prison. The former crypto exchange is just one of a handful of crypto bankruptcies throughout 2022. With the creditor payback plan revealed last week, FTX looks like it’s getting close to the finish line, joining the likes of other crypto bankruptcies like Celsius. Celsius, which exited bankruptcy back in January, was able to return roughly $3 billion to creditors. The bankruptcy plan, approved by creditors, sought to return between 67% and 85% to creditors. The bankrupt lender also spun out a bitcoin mining company called Ionic Digital. Read more: FTX debtors scrap reboot plans FTX’s hopes to relaunch as an exchange were dashed earlier this year when lawyers representing the estate said that they were unable to secure a bidder. BlockFi emerged from bankruptcy in October of last year, and announced last week that some creditors would be able to withdraw through Coinbase. Notably, the firm and FTX said that they’d reached a tentative agreement to settle litigation and disputes between the two former companies in March. According to an April status report filed by Voyager, FTX’s estate was also able to reach an agreement with the former lender. In May of last year, Voyager predicted that it would return 35% to customers. But it may be like comparing apples to oranges when looking at FTX versus the other 2022 bankruptcies. Jonathan Groth, a partner at DGIM law, told Blockworks that FTX is a “special case” in comparison. Read more: FTX bankruptcy almost across the finish line “This bankruptcy proceeding is a little differently situated than other bankruptcy and insolvency proceedings just because of the amount of assets that were located,” he said. Last week, the estate said it located between $14.5 billion and $16.3 billion in cash. Creditors are owed around $11 billion. A bankruptcy, like Celsius, may not be able to “realize the same benefit of asset location” that we’ve seen in FTX, Groth continued. “In any of these other insolvency proceedings where the estate and the fiduciary may be lucky enough to still hold some crypto assets, they may be able to benefit from this market upswing that we’re seeing.” But there are a few other reasons why FTX stands out against the other bankruptcies, explained Erin Broderick, lead counsel for the FTX.com customer claim holders and a partner at Eversheds Sutherland. “I think there’s a lot of things that make FTX unique [among] the crypto companies that went under. There was a lot of value in its user base…and the assets that they put onto the exchange…but also a confluence of other factors that contributed to the drastically different recovery prospects of today versus as of the petition date,” she said. In addition to the top-level differences, there’s also the fact that FTX is the “first case, to my knowledge, that’s paid post-petition interest to a convenience class, demonstrating not only good outcomes for creditors overall, but also some rather novel treatment under the plan.” Read more: What’s next for FTX after the creditor payback proposal? Then there’s the fact that the crypto market seems to have entered into a bull market at the beginning of the year. The run “helped on the asset side of the equation for recoveries [as] a number of the venture investments have had more value than perhaps realized as of the petition date. There’s also been a tremendous effort by the debtors on an asset recovery basis, whether it was cash or crypto that needed to come back into the estate,” Broderick said. “So there’ve been a lot of recovery efforts that also have led to large amounts of cash coming into the estates,” she continued. “And on the liability side, the debtors have done a good job of negotiating settlements with creditors to increase recoveries to customers.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

At the moment of inception, principles of development were laid in its foundation, which at the moment essentially distinguish Ripple from the rest of the crypto market. For example, one of the significant differences is that Ripple cannot be mined. The total number of coins was created immediately and can not be increased. On the other hand, it may decrease, since during the transactions a small commission is charged, which immediately burns. A very slow but steady decrease in the number of coins leads to the fact that the Ripple network is reliably protected from inflationary processes. The mechanism and purpose of Ripple have fundamental differences. It would be more correct to call XRP the protocol for financial transactions. All decisions made at the time of its birth, allowed it to form a very strong fundamental component of this coin. This component allowed Ripple to maintain and increase its leading position. In the future, this will undoubtedly help the coin to become the leader of the whole industry. The most important figure in the formation of Ripple is undoubtedly Chris Larsen. This person is known as a big fan of the Internet. He believes that any values should be transferred between people at the same speed as ordinary information on the Internet. At the same time, having enormous experience in the financial sphere, he understood that it was absolutely pointless to fight with the banks and resist them. Choosing this path, in the eyes of the global financial system, you will be nothing more than a marginal who does not understand anything absolutely and does not understand even the simplest foundations of a financial organization in the world. Therefore, Chris Larsen took a different path – the path of cooperation with the current financial system. With this approach, it becomes much easier and more promising to introduce something new and develop it. In 2012, Chris Larsen teamed up with like-minded people and created RippleLabs. The purpose of this company was instant financial transfers. It does not have a single transaction center. In a simplified explanation – these are banks and their network that process all this information. This whole system runs on independent servers. In this case, the server can belong to anyone. However, new servers can log in only with the approval of Ripple itself. The goal pursued by Chris Larsen was to remove all intermediaries from the remittance chain. Thus, all commissions for making transfers, especially cross-border ones, and they can reach more than 10% of the amount of transfer, were simply abolished. The time of such transfers was also significantly reduced – from a week or more to several hours, or even minutes. According to Chris Larsen himself, he initially didn’t have a goal to create some specific cryptocurrency. The initial goal which he set was to improve the existing system of currency transactions. The creation and implementation of the XRP token in their services was a conscientious decision of all partners of the established company. Banks, in turn, using RippleLabs services, were forced to inject XRP tokens into the existing banking system. Now the company has more than a hundred clients among banks all over the world. You can find here such giants as Mitsubishi Motors Financial Services, Santander, Bank of America, LianLian Group and American Express. Ripple Inc continues to focus on expanding its services and entering new markets. Having won many customers throughout America and Europe, the next goal of the company is Asia. Ripple is able to provide effective solutions that will optimize the performance of existing financial markets. In Asian markets, xRapid and transactions in XRP are increasingly common. After long negotiations, Ripple still managed to gain a foothold in China. This opens up absolutely unprecedented prospects and is a precursor to the growth of the XRP coin. Not only fantastic growth prospects inevitably attract a large number of investors. By investing in Ripple and buying this coin you, as a market participant, know exactly what you get. You are not purchasing air, something ephemeral and invisible, created by an unknown group of enthusiasts with dubious prospects. You are investing in a REAL payment system that already works with a huge number of the largest banks around the world. The opportunity to invest in the future of the entire banking system of our world is rare to appear.

604::https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/05/16/crypto-community-voices-outrage-at-tornado-cash-developer-verdict/::CoinDesk::article::Crypto Community Voices Outrage at Tornado Cash Developer Verdict::Alexey Pertsev, a developer of Tornado Cash, was sentenced to 64 months in prison for money laundering. A necessary step What's next?::'S-HERTOGENBOSCH, Netherlands — As 31-year old Russian Alexey Pertsev stood outside the courtroom on Tuesday awaiting a verdict from a judge at the s-Hertogenbosch courthouse in the Netherlands, he looked calm. When the judge ruled the Tornado Cash developer was guilty of money laundering, he did not appear to be outraged. It wasn't until the Dutch police edged toward him that he seemed surprised he wouldn't get to say goodbye to his loved ones – to anyone – and was instead immediately escorted to a cell under the large courthouse while the police found an appropriate jail for him to live out his 64-month sentence. Spectators in the courtroom were dumbfounded. Shock also rippled across the crypto community. Once the verdict was reached many took to X (formerly Twitter) to express their woes. "Wow, 64 months for developing software, that's crazy," one user wrote. "Sad day for privacy, crypto and open-source," Pablo Sabbatella, head of security research at crypto protection company Blockfence said, a view other users echoed. "This has gone too far," said Alexandre Stachtchenko, the former director of crypto and blockchain at KPMG France. "Another awful decision that will ultimately harm all of us," another user wrote. "This is the battlefield for privacy, speech, individualism, and yes, crypto," Ryan Selkis, founder and CEO of market intelligence products provider Messari Crypto said on X. The response, however, was not unanimous. Zumo founder and CEO Nick Jones saw the decision as a necessary step in crypto's development. "This is essential for fostering exemplary practices among all industry participants, ensuring a sector that people can trust," Jones said. Regulators and legal bodies worldwide have been tightening money laundering requirements for crypto. The European Union recently adopted a set of anti-money laundering rules that affect the industry, while the U.K enforced a crime bill to help seize and freeze crypto used for money laundering and other crimes in April. Money laundering is the process of disguising financial assets to make them look legitimate. The Dutch judge argued that Pertsev, who co-developed the anonymizing tool Tornado Cash, helped execute money laundering transactions. "It was Tornado Cash that executed the concealing and disguising [of] activities," an English translation of the verdict said. "When executing these activities with cryptocurrency derived from crime, Tornado Cash carries out money laundering activities." To Louise Abbott, a partner at Keystone Law, the decision makes sense given nations' anti-money laundering objectives. Tornado Cash is "a very popular offering for those with something to hide because it causes massive problems from a compliance and regulatory perspective. Tracing these transactions is almost impossible," Abbott said in an interview over email. The platform has been a key tool for North Korean hacking group Lazarus, which has been tied to a $625 million hack of Axie Infinity’s Ronin Network and other major crypto thefts. "In my opinion, the Dutch Courts have rightly found Alexey Pertsev, its developer, guilty of money laundering offenses," she said. Not every lawyer shares her views. "It’s a harsh punishment," said David Schreuders, a partner at law firm Simmons and Simmons' Amsterdam office. Crypto lawyer Fatemeh Fannizadeh told CoinDesk's Daniel Kuhn that the decentralized nature of crypto technology called for a "more nuanced legal approach,” than the traditional one. Read more: The Hard Truths and Worrying Consequences of the Tornado Cash Verdict Pertsev's trial is not the only one related to Tornado Cash. Roman Storm and Roman Semenov, who also helped develop the platform, face allegations of money laundering and sanctions violations in the U.S. Storm is expected to go to trial in September. Semenov has yet to be arrested. Pertsev's verdict could have an impact on those trials. "The guilty verdict in the Dutch Courts will have persuasive power in the U.S. Presumably the Dutch Court held there was sufficient evidence to link Pertsev’s conduct to akin to money laundering," Abbott said. "If those same links can be made with Storm, then that will undoubtedly help prosecutors in the U.S." It may not be over yet. Pertsev has applied to appeal the judges verdict. If his appeal is successful and a different verdict is reached, that new verdict could overrule the previous decision. "Any appeal would require Mr. Pertsev to prove that he as an individual was not responsible for the systems that allowed the anonymity of the Tornado cash programme," Abbott said.

605::https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-onchain-activity-decline/::BeInCrypto::article::Runes Protocol Slowdown Coincides with Bitcoin On-Chain Activity Slump::Bitcoin's on-chain activity has plummeted to its lowest level since 2019, indicating a significant downturn in trader engagement.::We use cookies to improve your experience.  Bitcoin (BTC) kicked off the new year with a robust surge, breaching the $70,000 mark and witnessing significant engagement on its blockchain network. However, recent developments indicate a cooling trend in these metrics. Over the past two months, the price of the leading digital asset has faced challenges, and on-chain activity has declined. Data from blockchain analytics firm Santiment indicates that Bitcoin’s on-chain activity has reached its lowest point since 2019. This decline suggests diminishing interest among traders, contrasting starkly with the earlier fervor. The firm suggested that the slump may mirror market participants’ broader sentiment of fear and uncertainty. This sentiment aligns with historical patterns, as transaction decreases often coincide with market volatility periods. Notably, BTC’s price has fallen by more than 11% during the past month to $61,205 as of press time. “This isn’t necessarily a sign of more BTC dips, but rather a signal of crowd fear and indecision,” Santiment analysts wrote. Read more: 8 Best On-Chain Analysis Tools in 2024 Meanwhile, some market observers pointed out that the dwindling on-chain activity coincides with the slowdown in Runes Protocol transactions after its initial surge. The protocol’s launch on BTC halving day triggered record transaction fees and volumes for the blockchain network. Despite this promising start, recent data suggests a noticeable decline in user engagement and transaction volumes. “After [Runes Protocol generated] a staggering $135 million in fees the first week, only 2 out of the last 12 days exceeded $1 million – with May 10th seeing the lowest activity,” crypto analyst Budhil Vyas said. Furthermore, the enthusiasm surrounding spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) seems to be fading. CoinShares data reveals a notable slowdown in trading volume for spot Bitcoin ETFs. Over the past month, several funds have experienced outflows and days of no inflows. Amidst the sluggishness in the ecosystem, two long-dormant Bitcoin addresses, originating from Satoshi Nakamoto’s early days, recently sprung back to life. According to blockchain analysis platform – Lookonchain, these wallets, inactive for approximately 11 years, transferred their entire holdings of 1,000 BTC, currently valued at a staggering $60.9 million. The wallets—labeled “16vRqA” and “1DUJuH”— had received initial deposits of 500 BTC each in September 2013 when Bitcoin was valued at a modest $124 per coin.

The USDC issuer confirmed to Blockworks that its parent company filed the “required paperwork with the High Court of the Republic of Ireland to redomicile the company to the US.” Bloomberg first reported the news. Earlier this year, Circle revealed that it confidentially filed for an initial public offering in the US in January of this year. The approach is common and has been used by other companies such as Airbnb and Uber. Read more: Circle confidentially files for US IPO “The number of shares to be offered and the price range for the proposed offering have not yet been determined. The initial public offering is expected to take place after the [Securities and Exchange Commission] completes its review process, subject to market and other conditions,” the press release said at the time. This isn’t the first time that Circle’s expressed interest in a US IPO, though the move from Ireland could suggest that the company is pursuing the traditional approach to going public. Circle had previously expressed interest in going public through a special-purpose acquisition company or SPAC. The route — which requires the private company looking to go public to merge with an existing publicly listed shell company — was popular throughout 2021 and 2022. While the S-1 filed with the SEC hasn’t been publicly released yet, it shows that the company is pursuing the more traditional IPO model this time around. Per SEC rules, potential investors won’t be able to publicly view the S-1 filed with the regulatory agency until 15 days before the company starts its roadshow. This changes, however, to 15 days prior to the registration date if a company chooses to not pursue a roadshow. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

Oh, how all of us want this to actually happen! But will it? The latest spike to $5,000 is just another blip as cryptocurrencies stumble toward maturity. Leonid Bershidsky said, the Bloomberg Opinion’s Europe columnist. He was the founding editor of the Russian business daily Vedomosti and founded the opinion website Slon.ru. What if, he’s wrong? What if, another squelcher article by the Economist, launched something great by their dark and scary picture of faulty bitcoin and “hundreds of copycat cryptocurrencies”? The article gives an overview of the crypto boom of 2017 and the ensuing failure, including an increase in the number of cryptocurrencies, the collapse of bitcoin from $20,000 to $3k and the failed IPO of Bitmain. Then there is a short comparison with tulip bulbs and the dot-com bubble. The Economist goes further, talking about recent insights – for example, that very few bitcoin transactions are actually used for e-commerce, the number of speculations and the problem of fictitious transactions that inflate real volumes. He then raises the issue of scale, saying that cryptocurrencies are “too clumsy” to compete with popular payment systems. The final part of the long list of problems includes bitcoin deflationary nature (which is often considered a feature in the crypto-sphere rather than a bug), as well as problems created by the irreversibility of transactions, including fraud and inaccessible reserves in the cold QuadrigaCX storage. Then the article seems to simply end with a paragraph about how the crypto community hopelessly thinks that the situation will improve. This is a grim picture, a list of failures and flaws. And this is exactly the kind of article that should’ve cheered the crypto lovers. The article is so adorably one-sided. There is absolutely no balance. Nothing about emerging technologies, or investment in the blockchain, or about expanding real-life use opportunities, or about developing institutional solutions. There’s something similar between the phoenix and bitcoin – when someone solid says that bitcoin is dead – it magically revives. But there were no magic this time, as always.

Pertsev has been given 64 months of prison time by the court. The 31-year old Russian was escorted after the session by police to the cells under the court. This is where he will remain until the public prosecutor finds a prison in the Netherlands that is appropriate for his crimes. "Tornado Cash does not pose any barrier for people with criminal assets who want to launder them," according to the translated verdict seen by CoinDesk. "That is why the court regards the defendant guilty of the money laundering activities as charged." Pertsev can appeal his sentence, which starts today. It does not appear that the time he spent behind bars between his arrest in August 2022 and Tuesday's verdict will count against the time he now has to spend in prison. An indictment shared ahead of the trial said that between July 9, 2019 and Aug. 10, 2022, Pertsev made "a habit of committing money laundering" and that he should have at least suspected the criminal origins of illicit transactions on the Tornado Cash platform. The developer was first jailed in the Netherlands in August 2022 after Tornado Cash was blacklisted by the U.S government. At the time, the U.S. Treasury had alleged that Tornado Cash was a key tool for the North Korean hacking group Lazarus. The Lazarus Group has been tied to a $625 million hack of Axie Infinity’s Ronin Network and other major crypto thefts. The trial result could play in future trials of other Tornado Cash developers. Other developers of the crypto mixer, Roman Storm and Roman Semenov, also face allegations of money laundering and sanctions violations in the U.S. Storm will go to trial this September, but Semenov has not yet been arrested. Storm was arrested last year, after the U.S. again added Tornado Cash to its sanctions watchlist.

Bonk [BONK] has a bullish outlook and managed to push toward the local resistance level once again. The BONK and Bitcoin [BTC] bulls had strong upward momentum, and further gains appeared likely. Yet, BTC was at a local resistance level. BONK could reach a supply zone soon. A BONK technical analysis by AMBCrypto earlier this month predicting a 15% drop and a subsequent 30% rally proved right. What could come next for the meme coin?  Source: BONK/USDT on TradingView In the past two months, BONK has traded within a range (purple) that extended from $0.0000286 to $0.0000136. The mid-range mark (dotted white) at $0.0000212 has also served as a support level. This formed a range within a range, and BONK saw a bounce from the mid-range level on the 13th of May. This came during the GME hype period, the token has performed well since then. Despite the 28.6% gains in the past six days, the CMF showed a negative reading of -0.11. This indicated significant capital outflow from the market. Hence, even though the RSI reflected bullish momentum with a reading of 61, it appeared that the selling pressure and the range high resistance could reject the meme token bulls. Source: Hyblock The one-month look-back period of the liquidation heatmap highlighted what the technical analysis already laid out. The $0.00002 and $0.00003 levels have the highest concentration of liquidity levels nearby. Realistic or not, here’s BONK’s market cap in BTC’s terms Therefore, it is likely that we see a move to $0.00003-$0.0000315 to collect this liquidity before a bearish reversal. To the south, the $0.0000186-$0.0000201 level could provide a stable demand zone.

Undeads Metaverse aims to become a breakout star and address the so-far unfulfilled promises of NFTs and the metaverse in the digital entertainment sector. This guide covers everything you need to know about the Undeads blockchain survival game and its encompassing ecosystem. Here’s what to know. Undeads is a play-to-earn online MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role-playing game). Set in a post-apocalyptic metaverse, the combat-oriented survival game opens with humans and zombies engaged in conflict. The online role-playing game offers a wide range of revenue-generating features. It is powered by in-game NFTs and operates on the Ethereum blockchain. In this world there are two main factions: humans and zombies. Players can also discover new areas, defend and grow their settlements, gather resources, craft and upgrade equipment, trade, pick a career, and grow their dynamic NFT character. Leo Kahn, formerly the Senior Director of Paypal’s crypto division, is the Undeads CEO. Kahn has 18 years of professional experience working for startups and Fortune 10 companies. He has also raised over $300 million and has extensive experience as a C-level executive. Ash Hodgetts is the Chief Marketing Officer. He was responsible for the success of Phantom Galaxies, another blockchain-based game. Ash has over 20 years of traditional video game marketing and development experience and has worked with large license holders including MLB and Disney. Some of the key members of the Undeads team are: As previously inferred, players can select between the Zombie and Human factions of the game, both of which are NFT assets. Humans can build, obtain professions, and craft weapons and other items. Zombies, however, drain resources from Humans and strengthen their ranks through breeding. The game is open-world, and players live by grinding for materials and manufacturing goods. You can protect your assets in player-vs-player (PvP) and player-vs-everyone (PvE) modes. Players can also become metaverse entrepreneurs by constructing residential, industrial, and commercial structures. Furthermore, the Undeads universe features a player-driven economy where users can own, buy, sell, trade, and acquire trophies redeemed for actual ETH through gameplay and various other tasks. 🌎The first detailed and large location of the Undeads world map has been designed and generated 🏠Hundreds of buildings, including enterable ones 🌴Trees & forests 🛣Dozens miles of roads 🚘Cars ✅And thousands of various handcrafted objects, animations and decorations… pic.twitter.com/WIeKdH2Hdr Beyond the combat-based game mechanics and land plots, the Undeads Metaverse offers many in-game items such as Mystery Boxes, Potions, Antidotes, and other NFT collections. Before the game begins, players can obtain an NFT box containing items they can use in the game. These boxes contain several perks, such as melee and ranged weapons, armor, and the ability to unlock specific professions (such as medic, soldier, etc.). Each box includes one main item and three bonus items. The types of boxes include: The game experience begins with the acquisition of Mystery Boxes, which contain five various sorts of potions. If a Mystery Box hasn’t been unboxed, a player can sell or swap among themselves. Alternatively, purchase a Legendary Box, and you will receive a fifth-grade potion containing one of 11 unique in-game NFTs with advanced stats, damage, and luck coefficients. Legendaries will have distinct special skills that provide them an advantage over other players. A potion allows any player to mint a random NFT Zombie. Depending on the grade of the potion, players can mint zombies ranging from common to first grade exceedingly rare Legendary Zombies. These offer unique in-game features, skills, and expensive weapons. There are five grades of potion: With 6666 Zombies and 6666 Humans to choose from, Undeads gamers are spoiled for choice. Each NFT has its own set of skills and appearances. The game also includes a variety of NFTs as playable characters, which will be available after the game is fully released. The Undeads NFT collection is set to strengthen the Undeads ecology by featuring stunning 3D graphics and fully playable in-game characters. Powered by Dynamic NFTs, they can be used to change player scores, in-game item levels, and durability. The antidote is an NFT that grants players access to a playable character from the Human faction. There are two kinds of antidotes: The first type of antidote is available free of charge to Zombie NFT holders through the Mystery Box Collection. Each Zombie can get one NFT Antidote. There will be 6666 total of this type of antidote. Players can acquire a character from the human faction in the following grades: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, or Legendary. If players decide not to utilize their NFT, they can sell it on the Undeads marketplace. The second sort of antidote is available during the Public Sale for ETH. There will also be 6666. This set will only offer Common, Uncommon, Rare, and Epic grades. The Undeads marketplace allows players to trade their items, ensuring quick and safe NFT transactions. Players can visit the marketplace to look for items for their characters. With each transaction, players launch personal trade smart contracts, shielding both the buyer and the seller from the dangers associated with trading. Another important feature of the Undead marketplace is the exclusive use of UDS tokens for transactions. This will help to sustain UDS demand and prop up the strength of the Undead economy. Additionally, all transactions in the marketplace will pay a percentage charge to the Community Treasury. The Undeads game is powered by two tokens: UDS and UGOLD. UDS is the governance token, and UGOLD is the in-game currency. Players must acquire the UDS token to unlock important in-game features, join the DAO, and vote on future gameplay developments and updates. As use increases, so does the need for UDS tokens. The UDS token launched on April 30, 2024. $UDS trading is now LIVE on #BitgetSpot. @Undeadscom 🔥 Come and grab a share of $78,000 Worth of UDS. 🚀 Trade now: https://t.co/lbRV7eylmq More details: https://t.co/qqWCVYb76L https://t.co/JQLVNYdI2p Similarly, the more people interact with the game, the more in-game currency, UGOLD, is created and burned. Fees serve as revenue for the Undead ecosystem. The total token supply is 250,000,000. The distribution is as follows: Holding or staking a small number of UDS tokens gives a user voting rights. To access certain features, a minimum staking or holding amount is required. According to the token distribution, 50 million UDS tokens are reserved for staking rewards over the course of 48 months. To hold voting rights for future gameplay upgrades or to use the essential in-game features, users must stake their UDS tokens. In exchange, a user will receive additional prizes based on the various characteristics. You can increase your staking benefits by purchasing and holding an NFT of a specific rarity or locking it in tandem with your UDS tokens for a set period of time. Staking payouts are distributed as a combination of UDS and UGOLD in a roughly 9:1 ratio, with the initial staking allotment serving as a cap. Tokens can be used in the game to unlock or purchase specific features or objects, as well as to upgrade users’ properties. The dashboard allows stakeholders to unstake, re-stake, or extend their shares. In terms of volume, OpenSea is among the biggest NFT marketplaces. It’s an easy exchange to utilize. You may build and administer NFT collections on eight distinct chains using OpenSea, including Ethereum, Arbitrum, Avalanche, BNB chain, Klaytn, Optimism, Polygon, and Solana. Rarible is an aggregator of NFT exchanges. The site offers listings for NFT exchanges on Immutable X, Ethereum, and blockchains that are compatible with EVM. Rarible is present on several blockchains. Rarible is an aggregator of NFT exchanges. The site offers listings for NFT exchanges on Immutable X, Ethereum, and blockchains that are compatible with EVM. Rarible is present on several blockchains. LooksRare is an NFT marketplace noted for its innovative strategy to rewarding traders, collectors, artists, and token holders for using its platform. All rewards are paid in LOOKS, which can be traded on secondary markets. Blur.io is a decentralized, Ethereum-based NFT marketplace. It is regarded as a top trading platform for NFTs based on transaction volume. The marketplace became popular due to its competition with OpenSea. According to the Blockchain Gaming Association, many positive factors influence NFT and blockchain-based game adoption. Mainstream adoption, funding, and the regulatory environment are all key drivers for this sector. If you’ve spent any time on social media or YouTube, looking at crypto and researching it, you see lots of people looking at crypto games as one of the next hot trends for 2024. These factors work in favor of web3 games like Undeads. The ecosystem already scores high marks in the realm of AAA game quality and mechanics. The lore and ecosystem are well thought out, and the in-game currency incentivizes players to hold the native UDS token, further strengthening the game’s ecosystem and features. The most important thing to remember when investing in any project is to proceed with caution and only ever invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider your financial situation before making commitments, and ensure that you always have a risk management and exit strategy in place. Undeads is a solid gaming ecosystem with impressive mechanics. Given the immense success of zombie titles such as Resident Evil, Call of Duty, Left 4 Dead, and others, Undeads is in the right place, potentially at the right time, with the UDS token launching in a favorable bullish market on April 30, 2024. If you enjoy the MMORPG or zombie genres and are looking for an exciting play-to-earn offering, Undeads delivers on all counts. Undeads is a play-to-earn MMORPG. The game is centered around two factions, zombies and humans, which battle it out in a constant game of survival. Undeads is NFT based and players can own or trade their in-game items. Undeads has two tokens, UDS and UGOLD. UDS is a governance token that users can stake and use to vote on protocol changes. UGOLD is the in-game currency to Undeads. There are five NFT marketplaces where players can purchase NFTs, OpenSea, Rarible, X2Y2, Looksrare, Blur. Players can also trade their NFT on the Undeads Marketplace. Users should beware of phishing scams and only trade on official marketplaces. The Undeads marketplace is an NFT trading platform where players can acquire items for their dynamic NFT characters. They can also trade or auction items to other players. Transactions on the Undead marketplace are a quick and safe way for players to trade with each other.

611::https://blockworks.co/news/trade-finance-might-not-be-sexy-but-its-blockchains-key-to-success::Blockworks::article::Trade finance might not be sexy, but it’s blockchain’s key to success::Opinion: Dune’s Arrakis Freman and Shogun’s bustling markets of feudal Japan would have benefited from blockchain to solve their trading woes.::Dune’s Arrakis Freman and Shogun’s bustling markets of feudal Japan would have benefited from blockchain to solve their trading woes Midjourney modified by Blockworks In the sands of Arrakis and the bustling markets of feudal Japan, trade is the lifeblood of society. Just as the characters in Dune and Shogun navigated intricate webs of alliances and commerce, businesses face similar challenges in today’s complicated global trade landscape. Yet, as supply chains become increasingly complex, it’s blockchain technology that is up to the task of revolutionizing and modernizing trade finance, offering a transformative solution to the persistent trade finance gap. While trade may sound like a complex conversation, two recent releases covering the subject have drawn massive audiences. Dune: Part Two has generated over $490 million at the box office, and Shogun garnered 9 million streaming views globally to become the best worldwide debut to date for a Disney General Entertainment scripted series. Today in the real world, trade also stretches across the globe, creating challenges for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) who need funding to support their operations. The recent rise in interest rates and the tightening of credit has led to more difficulty in managing capital demands — squeezing businesses on both sides of their ledger with higher costs to produce and higher costs to borrow. Current financial institutions are unable to adequately respond to these demands on their own, especially in regions that lack adequate banking. Clearly, the traditional banking system has not caught up with the needs of the global supply chain. Enter blockchain. Blockchain offers financial institutions the ability to leverage distributed ledger technology and digital asset solutions to meet the excessive demand for capital with sufficient supply. For that reason, the most prevalent and impactful use case for blockchain will be in the trade finance industry. The $5 trillion trade finance gap represents the collective difference in the demand for capital and the supply of capital for global shipments, obstructing the flow of funds to where it’s needed most — MSMEs. Mirroring the struggles of those small traders in Shogun’s ancient markets, MSMEs find themselves at a disadvantage due to inefficiencies, lack of visibility and centralized systems that hinder their access to funding. Blockchain, as a decentralized and transparent ledger, emerges as a powerful tool to address the shortcomings of traditional trade finance. It’s clear that the most prevalent and impactful use case for the technology will be in the trade finance industry. Blockchain creates new opportunities — for suppliers, buyers, banks and non-bank originators — and new rails to conduct commerce in real time, all the while carrying immutable data, records, capital and digital representations of real world assets. As governments around the world recognize this potential, blockchain’s role in global trade will become increasingly indispensable. We are seeing this already with the United Nations’ Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records (MLETR), which allows for transferable documents and instruments in electronic form, and other regulatory advancements in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Africa and South America. Unlike in Dune’s Arrakis and Shogun’s shores of feudal Japan, our modern trade networks can flourish and help solve suppliers’ growing demands, even easing pandemic-era disruptions. Blockchain also offers the greatest opportunity for MSMEs, originators and investors — who have been in the global supply chain trenches — to rise above outdated models and create a new vibrant ecosystem for businesses. And when user-friendly interfaces are more widespread, blockchain’s momentum will really be unstoppable. Read more from our opinion section: Blockchain really is better than middlemen With these opportunities, one would think people across the blockchain and crypto spaces would embrace its power to create new rails for businesses to build on and economies to scale. But there seems to be a real misunderstanding of what blockchain’s opportunity holds. Or perhaps there is a lack of understanding of trade finance and its value proposition. By contrast, investing in the hottest dog memecoin is an easy proposition to understand. This is the conundrum of blockchain. Users want the excitement of a fervent market over the slower path toward trade finance adoption. The route is more challenging for protocols to gain traction with those in the space who don’t understand blockchain’s trade finance value proposition. This limiting spirit won’t solve the problem of how to fund MSMEs across the globe and, in turn, feed value back to blockchain networks. In the end, our ethos should be rooted in this question: How do we create a more egalitarian way to help all boats rise, to ensure everyone succeeds? We do it by making blockchain more accessible to more people. Everyone will win — those who want to own a memecoin and those who want to create a better way for businesses across the globe to grow and prosper. Or even those who want both.

612::https://coinatory.com/cryptocurrency-news/kraken-actively-reviewing-usdt-19102/::Coinatory::article::Kraken ‘Actively Reviewing’ USDT Suspension in EU Amid MiCA Regulation::Kraken is evaluating the suspension of USDT in the EU due to upcoming MiCA regulations, highlighting the challenges of new digital asset rules.::Kraken considers delisting USDT stablecoin in the European Union Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken is evaluating the potential suspension of the USDT stablecoin for its European users, according to a Bloomberg report. This consideration arises as the European Union prepares to implement a new regulatory framework for digital assets in July. The impending Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations, which have not yet been finalized by the European Banking Authority, are expected to impose stringent restrictions on stablecoins available to European investors. Kraken’s global head of regulatory strategy, Marcus Hughes, stated, “We’re absolutely planning for all eventualities, including situations where it’s just not tenable to list specific tokens such as USDT.” Tether’s Response Tether officials anticipate that exchanges will prioritize euro liquidity for EU clients while maintaining USDT as a provisional measure. Despite this, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino previously indicated that Tether does not intend to comply with MiCA regulations in the medium term. Earlier this year, in March, OKX, another major cryptocurrency exchange, suspended USDT trading for European Union users, a move likely influenced by the forthcoming MiCA regulations. Legal Framework and Compliance MiCA aims to provide a clear legal framework for crypto exchanges and companies offering cryptocurrency custody services, allowing them to operate legally within the EU. The law will also establish comprehensive rules for the operation of stablecoin issuers. After MiCA comes into effect, crypto companies will be required to obtain registration in one of the EU member states, granting them the ability to operate throughout the entire bloc. The provisions specifically targeting stablecoins are set to become effective as early as June 2024. source Coinatory is a news portal dedicated to providing the latest updates on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and mining.

613::https://cryptobriefing.com/swib-bitcoin-etf-investment/::Crypto Briefing::article::Wisconsin state holds $99 million in BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF shares::SWIB's bold move into Bitcoin ETFs reflects a growing trend among institutional investors. ETFs suffer outflows::Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens! Share this article The State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) revealed its holdings of over $99 million worth of BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) IBIT at the end of the first quarter, according to its 13F Form filings with the SEC. The amount is equivalent to 2,450,500 IBIT shares. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas stated through an X post that “big fish institutions”, such as state pensions, usually don’t get in the 13F forms for up to a year, when the ETF gets more liquidity. “Good sign, expect more, as institutions tend to move in herds,” he added. Wow, a state pension bought $IBIT in first quarter. Normally you don't get these big fish institutions in the 13Fs for a year or so (when the ETF gets more liquidity) but as we've seen these are no ordinary launches. Good sign, expect more, as institutions tend to move in herds https://t.co/leKVe2CK1S — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) May 14, 2024 SWIB is an independent state agency which is responsible for managing the Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS), State Investment Fund (SIF), and several other smaller trust funds. Their 13F Form discloses nearly $37.9 billion in holdings. Notably, SWIB joins institutions such as UBS, JPMorgan, and Wells Fargo on Bitcoin exposure through ETFs. However, as highlighted by Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, the 13F Forms are a “snapshot” of these institutions’ holdings as of March 31, and they don’t account for short positions and derivatives. Moreover, some of these holdings might not be related to a long position, as companies such as JPMorgan could be acting as market makers for spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US. As of May 13, the spot Bitcoin ETFs traded in the US suffered a daily outflow of 866 BTC, which is equivalent to $55 million, as reported by the X user identified as Lookonchain. Despite the 292 BTC in inflows registered by IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC, the ETFs managed by Grayscale, Galaxy, and Franklin Templeton witnessed a 1,158 outflow on the same day. The total amount of Bitcoin under management is 826,220 BTC.

614::https://theconversation.com/behind-the-crypto-hype-is-an-ideology-of-social-change-177981::The Conversation::article::Behind the crypto hype is an ideology of social change::Many people promoting cryptocurrencies are looking for something bigger than the future of financial transactions. They’re aiming to break free of governments and corporations.::Ads for blockchain, NFTs and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin seem to be everywhere. Crypto technologies are being promoted as a replacement for banks; a new way to buy art; the next big investment opportunity, and an essential part of the metaverse. To many, these technologies are confusing or risky. But enthusiasts ardently promote them. As a cybersecurity and social media researcher, I’ve found that behind the hype is an ideology about social change: Hardcore enthusiasts argue that crypto will get people to trust in technology rather than government, which they see as inherently untrustworthy. This ideology leads people to encourage its use while downplaying its risks. My colleagues and I studied almost three months of discussions on Reddit forums about cryptocurrencies to try to understand how people talk about crypto and Bitcoin. The loudest voices on the forum were a group of crypto enthusiasts who called themselves “True Bitcoiners.” Unlike technology enthusiasts or crypto marketers, “true bitcoiners” didn’t talk about technology, or about their own use of crypto. Instead, they talked about trust and corruption. These crypto enthusiasts often cite examples of what they see as government corruption and corporate corruption. They recognize that society depends on governments and corporations setting and enforcing rules, and they complain that people are stuck with these “corrupt” institutions. Corruption, they say, is an inevitable flaw in humanity and leads to trying to control and mistreat others. The enthusiasts see Bitcoin, blockchain and other crypto technologies as providing an alternative to the corruption. They argue that these new technologies are “trustless” and don’t depend on institutions. You can buy and sell things using bitcoin without checking with a bank or using government-issued cash. These two beliefs – that governments are corrupt and that crypto avoids that corruption – are common among the crypto enthusiasts we studied. But enthusiasts go one step further. They seek change. They want to change who has power and who doesn’t. They argue that crypto is how that change will happen. For crypto enthusiasts, using crypto isn’t just a way to buy and sell things. By using crypto technologies, they argue, society will become less dependent on governments and corporations. That is, using crypto – and getting as many people as possible to use it as much as possible – is a way to change the world and take power away from governments. These beliefs about who should and should not have power in society embody an ideology. An important part of the crypto ideology is that this change can’t happen unless people use crypto. The technology and the ideology are tied together. For many of these enthusiasts, recommending crypto to other people is not just a technology recommendation. To them, buying and selling crypto is a form of political and social activism. They argue that buying crypto will remove corruption and change society to trust technology over government. This ideology is a more extreme version of technolibertarianism, which seeks to replace government with technology. Like technolibertarians, true bitcoiners want technology to control society. But they focus on financial and economic control more than civil liberties. And because promoting crypto is part of this ideology, crypto has often been compared with a religion. An important aspect of any ideology is the way it emphasizes some dangers and downplays others. True bitcoiners emphasize the problems with government corruption. But they downplay the financial risks of crypto. The price of Bitcoin fluctuates wildly, and many people have lost money buying crypto. Crypto wallets are difficult to understand and use, and fraudulent transactions are difficult to reverse. Crypto enthusiasts frequently downplay the technology’s risks to people and society. They also dismiss the valuable role that governments and corporations play in protecting people’s money, providing insurance for bank accounts and returning money that’s been stolen. Beliefs in crypto’s ability to create social change are also overstated. Crypto technologies don’t necessarily eliminate corporations or avoid government control. There are private, corporate blockchains and many government regulations about cryptocurrencies. As I see it, simply using the technology doesn’t necessarily lead to the social change these enthusiasts seek.

Several cryptos that have led the index of late pulled back this week, including aptos (APT) and dogecoin (DOGE), each falling more than 14%.
